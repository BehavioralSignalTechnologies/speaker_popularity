    " Today I'd like to show you the future of the way we make things.": 1,
    "I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, replicating and repairing themselves.": 1,
    " So I'm going to show you what I believe is the current state of manufacturing and then compare that to some natural systems.": 1,
    "So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers, two and a half years with 500,000 to a million parts.": 1,
    " Fairly complex, new exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass.": 1,
    "We have exciting machines that can take us into space.": 1,
    "Five years, 2.5 million parts.": 1,
    " But on the other side, if you look at the natural systems,": 1,
    " We have proteins that have 2 million types, can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, or DNA with 3 million base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour.": 1,
    " There's all this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.": 1,
    "They're far more efficient in terms of energy.": 1,
    " They hardly ever make mistakes, and they can repair themselves for longevity.": 1,
    "So there's something super interesting about natural systems, and if we can translate that into our built environment,": 1,
    " then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things.": 1,
    "And I think the key to that is self-assembly.": 1,
    "So if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there's four key factors.": 1,
    "The first is that we need to decode": 1,
    " all of the complexity of what we want to build, so our buildings and machines.": 1,
    "We need to decode that into simple sequences, basically the DNA of how our buildings work.": 1,
    "Then we need new programmable parts that can take that sequence and use that to fold up or reconfigure.": 1,
    " We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate, allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program.": 1,
    "And we need some type of error correction, redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want.": 1,
    " So I'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.": 1,
    "The first two are the Macrobot and Decibot.": 1,
    " So these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots, 8 foot, 12 foot long proteins.": 1,
    "They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors.": 1,
    " You decode what you want to fold up into, into a sequence of angles.": 1,
    "So negative 120, negative 120, zero, zero, 120, negative 120.": 1,
    " something like that, so a sequence of angles or turns, and you send that sequence through the string.": 1,
    "Each unit takes its message, so negative 120, it rotates to that, checks if it got there, and then passes it to its neighbor.": 1,
    " So these are the brilliant scientists, engineers, designers that worked on this project.": 1,
    "And I think it really brings to light, is this really scalable?": 1,
    " I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot.": 1,
    "Can we really scale this up?": 1,
    "Can we really embed robotics into every part?": 1,
    " The next one questions that and looks at passive nature or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability, but it goes a step further and it tries to have actual computation.": 1,
    " It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing, the digital logic gate, directly into your parts.": 1,
    "So this is a NAND gate.": 1,
    "You have one tetrahedron, which is the gate that's going to do your computing.": 1,
    "And you have two input tetrahedrons.": 1,
    " One of them is the input from the user as you're building your bricks.": 1,
    "The other one is from the previous brick that was placed.": 1,
    "And then it gives you an output in 3D space.": 1,
    " So what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do.": 1,
    "It computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do.": 1,
    " And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space, so up or down.": 1,
    "So on the left-hand side, one-one input equals zero output, which goes down.": 1,
    "On the right-hand side, zero-zero input as a one output, which goes up.": 1,
    " And so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build.": 1,
    "So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed.": 1,
    "So that means that we can have some form of self-replication.": 1,
    "In this case I call it self-guided replication.": 1,
    " Because your structure contains the exact blueprints.": 1,
    "If you have errors, you can replace a part.": 1,
    "All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.": 1,
    "So you can have something that climbs along it, reads it, and can output it one-to-one.": 1,
    "It's directly embedded.": 1,
    "There's no external instructions.": 1,
    " So the last project I'll show is called Bias Chains.": 1,
    "And it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly system.": 1,
    "So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system.": 1,
    " So basically, you have a chain of elements.": 1,
    "Each element is completely identical.": 1,
    "And they're biased.": 1,
    "So each chain or each element wants to turn right or left.": 1,
    "So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.": 1,
    "You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.": 1,
    " So when you shake the chain,": 1,
    " It then folds up into any configuration that you've programmed it.": 1,
    "So in this case, a spiral, or in this case,": 1,
    " two cubes next to each other.": 1,
    "So you can basically program any three dimensional shape or one dimensional, two dimensional up into this chain completely passively.": 1,
    "So what does this tell us about the future?": 1,
    "I think that it's": 1,
    " telling us that there's new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, our buildings, machines.": 1,
    "There's new programmability in these parts.": 1,
    " And from that, you have new possibilities for computing.": 1,
    "We have spatial computing.": 1,
    "Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, machines, all of our bricks could actually compute.": 1,
    "That's amazing parallel and distributed computing power.": 1,
    "New design possibilities.": 1,
    "So there's exciting potential for this.": 1,
    " So I think these projects I've showed you are just a tiny step towards this future if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
