    " Professor Fuller presented a particularly audacious proposal for the geoscope.": 1,
    "It was a 200 foot diameter geodesic sphere.": 1,
    " to be sited suspended over the East River in New York City in full view of the United Nations.": 1,
    "It was a big idea for sure and it was one that": 1,
    " He felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body through animations of global data trends and other information regarding the globe on this sphere.": 1,
    " And today, 45 years later, we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective.": 1,
    "But what we do have is improved technology.": 1,
    "Today, we don't need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display.": 1,
    "We can use LEDs.": 1,
    " LEDs are smaller, they're cheaper, they're longer lasting, they're more efficient.": 1,
    "Most importantly for this, they're faster.": 1,
    "And this speed combined with today's high-performance microcontrollers allow us to actually simulate": 1,
    " In this piece, over 17,000 LEDs using just 64.": 1,
    " And the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision.": 1,
    "That as this ring rotates at about 1700 RPM, that's 28 times per second, the equator speed is actually about 60 miles per hour.": 1,
    " There are four onboard microcontrollers that each time this ring rotates, as it passes at the rear of the display, it picks up a position signal.": 1,
    "And from that, the onboard microcontrollers can extrapolate the position of the ring.": 1,
    " at all points around the revolution and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations.": 1,
    "But this is really just the beginning.": 1,
    " In addition to higher resolution versions of this display, my father and I are working on a new patent pending design for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon.": 1,
    " And it achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes.": 1,
    "So as you can see here, this is an 11-inch diameter circuit board.": 1,
    "These blocks represent LEDs.": 1,
    "And so you can see that as this disc rotates about this axis, it will create": 1,
    " a disk of light that we can control.": 1,
    "That's nothing new.": 1,
    "That's a propeller clock.": 1,
    "That's the rims that you can buy for your car.": 1,
    "But what is new is that when we rotate this disk about this axis,": 1,
    " Now this disk of light actually becomes a sphere of light.": 1,
    "And so we can control that with microcontrollers and create a fully volumetric three-dimensional display with just 256 LEDs.": 1,
    " Now this piece is currently in process due out in May, but what we've done is we've put together a small demo just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere.": 1,
    " I've got a little video to show you, but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control, and this is also with only four LEDs.": 1,
    "This is actually only about one and a half percent of what the final display will be in May, so take a look.": 1,
    " And here you can see it's rotating about the vertical axis only creating circles.": 1,
    " and then as the other axis kicks in, those actually blur into a volume.": 1,
    "The shutter speed of the camera actually makes it slightly less effective in this case.": 1,
    " But this piece is due out in May.": 1,
    "It'll be on display at the Interactive Telecommunications Spring Show in Greenwich Village, New York City.": 1,
    "That's open to the public.": 1,
    "Definitely invite you all to come and attend.": 1,
    "It's a fantastic show.": 1,
    " hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects.": 1,
    "This piece actually will be on display down in the Sierra simulcast lounge in the breaks between now and the end of the show.": 1,
    "So I'd love to talk to you all and invite you to come down and take a closer look.": 1,
    " It's an honor to be here.": 1,
    "Thanks very much.": 1
