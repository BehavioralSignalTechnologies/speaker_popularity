    " How would you like to be better than you are?": 1,
    "Suppose I said that with just a few changes in your genes, you can get a better memory, more precise, more accurate and quicker.": 1,
    " Or maybe you'd like to be more fit, stronger, with more stamina.": 1,
    "Would you like to be more attractive and self-confident?": 1,
    " How about living longer with good health?": 1,
    " Or perhaps you're one of those who's always yearned for more creativity.": 1,
    "Which one would you like the most?": 1,
    " Which would you like if you could have just one?": 1,
    " Creativity.": 1,
    " How many people would choose creativity?": 1,
    "Raise your hands, let me see.": 1,
    "A few, probably about as many as there are creative people here, that's very good.": 1,
    " How many would opt for memory?": 1,
    " Quite a few more.": 1,
    "How about fitness?": 1,
    " Few less.": 1,
    "What about longevity?": 1,
    " Ah, the majority, that makes me feel very good as a doctor.": 1,
    "If you could have any one of these, it would be a very different world.": 1,
    "Is it just imaginary, or is it perhaps possible?": 1,
    " Evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED conference, but I want to give you today one doctor's take on the subject.": 1,
    " the great 20th century geneticist T.G.": 1,
    "Dobzhansky, who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church.": 1,
    " once wrote an essay that he titled, Nothing in Biology Makes Sense, Except in the Light of Evolution.": 1,
    " Now, if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution, this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid, take out your personal communications device.": 1,
    "I give you permission.": 1,
    " And perhaps take another look at Catherine Schulz's book on being wrong, because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you.": 1,
    " But if you do accept biological evolution, consider this.": 1,
    "Is it just about the past?": 1,
    " or is it about the future?": 1,
    "Does it apply to others or does it apply to us?": 1,
    "This is another look at the tree of life.": 1,
    " In this picture, I've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions because if you look at the edges of the tree of life,": 1,
    " every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms.": 1,
    "It has survived.": 1,
    "It has demonstrated a fitness to its environment.": 1,
    " The human part of this branch way out on one end is, of course, the one that we are most interested in.": 1,
    " We branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.": 1,
    "In the interval, there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hominids.": 1,
    " Some have come and gone.": 1,
    "We have been here for about 130,000 years.": 1,
    "It may seem like we're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, for the most part,": 1,
    " the basic machinery of ourselves is pretty much the same.": 1,
    "Do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium": 1,
    " to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics.": 1,
    "This is not like human insulin.": 1,
    "This is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas.": 1,
    " And speaking of bacteria, do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body?": 1,
    "Maybe 10 times more.": 1,
    "I mean, think of it, when Anthony DiMasio asks about your self-image,": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " Do you think about the bacteria?": 1,
    " Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria.": 1,
    "It's warm, it's dark, it's moist, it's very cozy.": 1,
    "And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part.": 1,
    "It's really like an easy street.": 1,
    " for bacteria with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rush to the exit, but otherwise...": 1,
    " You are a wonderful environment for those bacteria just as they are essential to your life.": 1,
    "They help in the digestion of essential nutrients and they protect you against certain diseases.": 1,
    " But what will come in the future?": 1,
    "Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species or?": 1,
    " Are we destined to become something different, something perhaps even better adapted to the environment?": 1,
    " Now let's take a step back in time to the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago.": 1,
    "The Earth, the solar system, about four and a half billion years.": 1,
    "The first signs of proto-life maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth.": 1,
    " the first multi-celled organisms perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago, and then the human species finally emerging.": 1,
    " in the last 130,000 years.": 1,
    "In this vast, unfinished symphony of the universe, life on earth is like a brief measure, the animal kingdom like a single, single measure.": 1,
    " and human life a small grace note.": 1,
    " That was us.": 1,
    " That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk, so I hope you enjoyed it.": 1,
    " Now, when I was a freshman in college, I took my first biology class.": 1,
    "I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty.": 1,
    " of biology.": 1,
    "I became enamored of the power of evolution and I realized something very fundamental.": 1,
    "In most of the existence of life with single-celled organisms, each cell simply divides.": 1,
    " And all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells.": 1,
    "But at the time multi-celled organisms come online, things start to change.": 1,
    "Sexual reproduction enters the picture.": 1,
    " And very importantly, with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome, the rest of the body becomes expendable.": 1,
    " You could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction.": 1,
    "Now, I have to confess.": 1,
    " When I was a college undergraduate, I thought, okay, sex, death, sex, death, death for sex seemed pretty reasonable at the time.": 1,
    " But with each passing year, I've come to have increasing doubts.": 1,
    "I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns, who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his 90s.": 1,
    "And one night, there's a knock at his hotel room door.": 1,
    "He answers the door.": 1,
    " Standing before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl.": 1,
    "She looks at him and says, I'm here for super sex.": 1,
    "That's fine, says George, I'll take the soup.": 1,
    " I came to realize as a physician that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution.": 1,
    " not necessarily contradictory, just different.": 1,
    "I was trying to preserve the body.": 1,
    "I wanted to keep us healthy.": 1,
    "I wanted to restore health from disease.": 1,
    "I wanted us to live long,": 1,
    " and healthy lives.": 1,
    "Evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation, adapting and surviving through generation after generation.": 1,
    " From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off.": 1,
    " into the sea.": 1,
    "I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed when he said, I don't want to achieve immortality through my work, I want to achieve it through not dying.": 1,
    " Evolution does not necessarily favor the longest lived.": 1,
    "It doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and not even the smartest.": 1,
    "Evolution favors": 1,
    " those creatures best adapted to their environment.": 1,
    "That is the sole test of survival and success.": 1,
    "At the bottom of the ocean,": 1,
    " bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce, if fish were there, sous vide cooked fish.": 1,
    " nevertheless have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them.": 1,
    "So what does this mean?": 1,
    " as we look back at what has happened in evolution and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase.": 1,
    " I would say that there are a number of possibilities.": 1,
    "The first is that we will not evolve.": 1,
    " We have reached a kind of equipoise.": 1,
    "And the reasoning behind that would be, first, we have, through medicine, managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population.": 1,
    " And secondly, we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it.": 1,
    " And by the way, we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place.": 1,
    " A second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind, natural, imposed by the forces of nature.": 1,
    " And the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly, but they are inexorable.": 1,
    " And as far as isolation goes, when we as a species do colonize distant planets, there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way.": 1,
    "But there's a third possibility.": 1,
    " an enticing, intriguing, and frightening possibility.": 1,
    "I call it neo-evolution, the new evolution that is not simply natural, but guided and chosen by us.": 1,
    " individuals in the choices that we will make.": 1,
    "Now how could this come about?": 1,
    "How could it be possible": 1,
    " that we would do this.": 1,
    "Consider first the reality that people today in some cultures are making choices about their offspring.": 1,
    " They're in some cultures choosing to have more males than females.": 1,
    "It's not necessarily good for the society, but it's what the individual and the family are choosing.": 1,
    " Think also if it were possible ever for you not simply to choose the sex of your child, but for you in your body.": 1,
    " to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases?": 1,
    "What if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's?": 1,
    " or reduce the risk of cancer, or eliminate stroke.": 1,
    "Wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes?": 1,
    "If we look ahead,": 1,
    " these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible.": 1,
    "The Human Genome Project started in 1990.": 1,
    " And it took 13 years.": 1,
    "It cost $2.7 billion.": 1,
    " the year after it was finished in 2004, you could do the same job for $20 million in three to four months.": 1,
    " Today, you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about $20,000 and in the space of about a week.": 1,
    " It won't be very long before the reality will be the $1,000 human genome and it will be increasingly available for everyone.": 1,
    " Just a week ago, the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper Prize to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer, two scientists who independently developed techniques": 1,
    " to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way, what Francis Arnold calls directed evolution.": 1,
    " A couple of years ago, the Lasker Prize was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell, a fibroblast.": 1,
    " And by manipulating just four genes, he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell.": 1,
    " potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body.": 1,
    "These changes are coming.": 1,
    "The same technology.": 1,
    " that has produced the human insulin and bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves, but induce immunity against other viruses.": 1,
    "Believe it or not, there's an experimental trial going on": 1,
    " with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant.": 1,
    "Can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco?": 1,
    " These are all reality today and the future will be evermore possible.": 1,
    "Imagine then just two other little changes.": 1,
    "You can change the cells in your body.": 1,
    " But what if you could change the cells in your offspring?": 1,
    "What if you could change the sperm in the ova or change the newly fertilized egg and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life?": 1,
    " eliminate the diabetes, eliminate the hemophilia, reduce the risk of cancer.": 1,
    "Who doesn't want healthier children?": 1,
    "And then, that same analytic technology, that same engine of science that can produce": 1,
    " The changes to prevent disease will also enable us to adopt super attributes, hyper capacities.": 1,
    " that better memory, why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings, especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine.": 1,
    " Why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer?": 1,
    "Why not live longer?": 1,
    " These will be irresistible.": 1,
    "And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want, we will have converted": 1,
    " old style evolution into neo-evolution.": 1,
    "We'll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years and we can compress it down to 1,000 years and maybe even in the next 100 years.": 1,
    " These are choices that your grandchildren or their grandchildren are going to have before them.": 1,
    " Will we use these choices to make a society that is better, that is more successful, that is kinder, or will we selectively choose different attributes": 1,
    " that we want for some of us and not for others of us?": 1,
    "Will we make a society that is": 1,
    " more boring and more uniform, or more robust and more versatile?": 1,
    "These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face.": 1,
    "And most profoundly of all, will we ever be able to develop the wisdom": 1,
    " and to inherit the wisdom that we'll need to make these choices wisely.": 1,
    "For better or worse, and sooner than you may think, these choices will be up to us.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
