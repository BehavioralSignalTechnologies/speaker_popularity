    " So infectious diseases, right?": 1,
    "Infectious diseases are still the main cause of human suffering and death around the world.": 1,
    "Every year, millions of people die of diseases such as TB, malaria, HIV around the world, and even in the United States, every year.": 1,
    " Thousands of Americans die of seasonal flu.": 1,
    "Now, of course, humans, we are creative, right?": 1,
    "We have come up with ways to protect ourselves against this disease.": 1,
    "We have drugs and vaccines.": 1,
    "And we're conscious.": 1,
    "We learn from our experiences and come up with creative solutions.": 1,
    " We used to think we're alone in this, but now we know we're not.": 1,
    "We're not the only medical doctors.": 1,
    "Now we know that there's a lot of animals out there that can do it, too.": 1,
    "Most famous, perhaps, chimpanzees.": 1,
    "Not so much different from us.": 1,
    "They can use plants to treat their intestinal parasites.": 1,
    " But the last few decades have shown us that other animals can do it too.": 1,
    "Elephants, porcupines, sheep, goats, you name it.": 1,
    "And even more interesting than that is that recent discoveries are telling us that insects and other little animals with smaller brains": 1,
    " can use medication too.": 1,
    "The problem with infectious diseases, as we all know, is that pathogens continue to evolve, and a lot of the drugs that we have developed are losing their efficacy.": 1,
    " And therefore, there is this great need to find new ways to discover drugs that we can use against our diseases.": 1,
    "Now, I think that we should look at these animals and we can learn from them how to treat our own diseases.": 1,
    " As a biologist, I have been studying monarch butterflies for the last 10 years.": 1,
    "Now, monarchs are extremely famous for their spectacular migration from the US and Canada down to Mexico every year, where millions of them come together.": 1,
    " But it's not why I started studying them.": 1,
    "I study monarchs because they get sick.": 1,
    "They get sick like you, they get sick like me.": 1,
    "And I think what they do can tell us a lot about drugs that we can develop for humans.": 1,
    " Now, the parasites that monarchs get infected with are called ophryocystis electroscura, a mouthful.": 1,
    "What they do is they produce spores, millions of spores on the outside of the butterfly that is shown as little specks in between the scales of the butterfly.": 1,
    " And this is really detrimental to the monarch.": 1,
    "It shortens their lifespan, it reduces their ability to fly, it can even kill them before they're even adults.": 1,
    "Very detrimental parasite.": 1,
    " As part of my job, I spend a lot of time in the greenhouse, growing plants.": 1,
    "And the reason for this is that monarchs are extremely picky eaters.": 1,
    "They only eat milkweed as larvae.": 1,
    " Luckily, there are several species of milkweed that they can use, and all these milkweeds have cardinalides in them.": 1,
    "These are chemicals that are toxic.": 1,
    "They're toxic to most animals, but not to monarchs.": 1,
    "In fact,": 1,
    " Monarchs can take up the chemicals, put it in their own bodies, and it makes them toxic against their predators, such as birds.": 1,
    "And what they do then is advertise this toxicity through their beautiful warning colorations with this orange, black, and white.": 1,
    " So what I did during my job is grow plants in the greenhouse, different ones of them, different milkweed.": 1,
    "Some were toxic, including the tropical milkweed.": 1,
    "It has very high concentrations of these cardinalides.": 1,
    " and some were not toxic.": 1,
    "And then I fed them to monarchs.": 1,
    "Some of the monarchs were healthy, they had no disease, but some of the monarchs were sick, and what I found is that some of these milkweeds are medicinal, meaning they reduce the disease symptoms in the monarch butterflies.": 1,
    " meaning these monarchs can live longer when they are infected when feeding on these medicinal plants.": 1,
    "And when I found this, I had this idea, and a lot of people said it was a crazy idea.": 1,
    " But I thought, what if monarchs can use this, right?": 1,
    "What if they can use these plants as their own form of medicine?": 1,
    "What if they can act as medical doctors?": 1,
    " So my team and I started doing experiments.": 1,
    "In the first types of experiments, we had caterpillars and gave them a choice.": 1,
    "Medicinal male creed versus non-medicinal male creed.": 1,
    "And then we measured how much they ate of each species over their lifetime.": 1,
    " And the result, as so often in science, was boring.": 1,
    "Fifty percent of their food was medicinal and fifty percent was not.": 1,
    "These caterpillars didn't do anything for their own welfare.": 1,
    " So then we moved on to adult butterflies, and we started asking the question whether it's the mothers that can medicate their offspring.": 1,
    "Can the mothers lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future offspring less sick?": 1,
    " We have done these experiments now for several years and always get the same results.": 1,
    "What we do is we put a monarch in a big cage, medicinal plant on one side and non-medicinal plant on the other side, and then we measure the number of eggs that the monarchs lay on each plant.": 1,
    " And what we find when we do that is always the same.": 1,
    "What we find is that the monarchs strongly prefer the medicinal male creed.": 1,
    "In other words, what these females are doing is they're laying 68% of their eggs on the medicinal male creed.": 1,
    " Intriguingly, what they do is they actually transmit the parasites when they're laying the eggs.": 1,
    "They cannot prevent this.": 1,
    "They can also not medicate themselves.": 1,
    "But what these experiments tell us": 1,
    " is that these monarchs, these mothers, can lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed that will make their future offspring less sick.": 1,
    " Now this is a really important discovery, I think, not just because it tells us something cool about nature, but also because it may tell us something more about how we should find drugs.": 1,
    "Now these are animals that are very small.": 1,
    " And we tend to think of them as very simple.": 1,
    "They have tiny little brains, yet they can do this very sophisticated medication.": 1,
    " Now, we know that even today, most of our drugs derive from natural products, including plants.": 1,
    "And in indigenous cultures, traditional healers often look at animals to find new drugs.": 1,
    " In this way, elephants have told us how to treat stomach upset, and porcupines have told people how to treat bloody diarrhea.": 1,
    "What I think is important, though, is to move beyond these large-brained mammals": 1,
    " and give these guys more credit, these simple animals, these insects that we tend to think of as very, very simple with tiny little brains.": 1,
    " the discovery that these animals can also use medication opens up completely new avenues.": 1,
    "And I think that maybe one day, we will be treating human diseases with drugs that were first discovered by butterflies.": 1,
    " And I think that is an amazing opportunity worth pursuing.": 1,
    "Thank you so much.": 1
