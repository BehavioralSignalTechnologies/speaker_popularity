    " I've always had a fascination for computers and technology, and I made a few apps for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad.": 1,
    "I'd like to share a couple with you today.": 1,
    " My first app was a unique fortune teller called Earth Fortune that would display different colors of Earth depending on what your fortune was.": 1,
    "My favorite and most successful app is Bustin' Jeeber.": 1,
    " which is a Justin Bieber whack-a-mole.": 1,
    " I created it because a lot of people at school disliked Justin Bieber a little bit.": 1,
    "So I decided to make the app.": 1,
    "So I went to work programming it and I released it just before the holidays in 2010.": 1,
    " A lot of people ask me, how did I make these?": 1,
    " A lot of times it's because the person who asks the question wants to make an app also.": 1,
    "A lot of kids these days like to play games, but now they want to make them, and it's difficult.": 1,
    " Because not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program.": 1,
    "I mean for soccer, you could go to a soccer team.": 1,
    "For violin, you could get lessons for a violin.": 1,
    "But what if you want to make an app?": 1,
    " And the kids' parents might have done some of these things when they were young.": 1,
    "But not many parents have written apps.": 1,
    " Where do you go to find out how to make an app?": 1,
    "Well, this is how I approached it.": 1,
    "This is what I did.": 1,
    "First of all, I've been programming in multiple other programming languages to get the basics down.": 1,
    " such as Python, C, Java, etc.": 1,
    "And then Apple released the iPhone, and with it the iPhone software development kit.": 1,
    "And the software development kit": 1,
    " is a suite of tools for creating and programming an iPhone app.": 1,
    " This opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me.": 1,
    "And after playing with the software development kit a little bit, I made a couple apps.": 1,
    "I made some test apps.": 1,
    " One of them happened to be Earth Fortune, and I was ready to put Earth Fortune on the App Store, and so I persuaded my parents to pay the $99 fee to be able to put my apps on the App Store.": 1,
    " They agreed and now I have apps on the App Store.": 1,
    " I've gotten a lot of interest and encouragement from my family, friends, teachers, and even people at the Apple Store.": 1,
    "And that's been a huge help to me.": 1,
    " I got a lot of inspiration from Steve Jobs.": 1,
    " I started an app club at school and a teacher at my school is kindly sponsoring my app club.": 1,
    "Any student at my school can come and learn how to design an app.": 1,
    " This is so I can share my experiences with others.": 1,
    "There's these programs called the iPad pilot program and some districts have them.": 1,
    "I'm fortunate enough to be part of one.": 1,
    " A big challenge is how should the iPads be used and what apps should we put on the iPads?": 1,
    " So we're getting feedback from teachers at the school to see what kind of apps they'd like.": 1,
    "When we design the app and we sell it, it will be free to local districts and other districts that we sell to.": 1,
    " All the money from that will go into the local aid foundations.": 1,
    " These days, students usually know a little bit more than teachers with the technology.": 1,
    " So...": 1,
    " Sorry.": 1,
    " So this is a resource to teachers, and educators should recognize this resource and make good use of it.": 1,
    " I'd like to finish up by saying what I'd like to do in the future.": 1,
    "First of all, I'd like to create more apps, more games.": 1,
    "I'm working with a third party company to make an app.": 1,
    " I like to get into Android programming and development.": 1,
    "And I'd like to continue my app club and find other ways for students to share knowledge with others.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
