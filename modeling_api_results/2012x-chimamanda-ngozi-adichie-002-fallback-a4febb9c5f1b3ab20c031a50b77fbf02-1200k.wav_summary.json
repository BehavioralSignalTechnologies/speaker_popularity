    " So I would like to start by telling you about one of my greatest friends, Okoloma Madwawesi.": 1,
    "Okoloma lived on my street and looked after me like a big brother.": 1,
    "If I liked a boy, I would ask Okoloma's opinion.": 1,
    " Oklahoma died in the notorious Sosoliso plane crash in Nigeria in December of 2005, almost exactly seven years ago.": 1,
    " Okoma was a person I could argue with, laugh with, and truly talk to.": 1,
    " He was also the first person to call me a feminist.": 1,
    " I was about 14, we were in his house arguing, both of us bristling with half-baked knowledge from books that we had read.": 1,
    "I don't remember what this particular argument was about.": 1,
    " But I remember that as I argued and argued, Oklahoma looked at me and said, you know, you're a feminist.": 1,
    "It was not a compliment.": 1,
    " I could tell from his tone, the same tone that you would use to say something like, you're a supporter of terrorism.": 1,
    " I did not know exactly what this word feminist meant, and I did not want Okoloma to know that I did not know.": 1,
    "So I brushed it aside and I continued to argue.": 1,
    "And the first thing I planned to do when I got home was to look up the word feminist in the dictionary.": 1,
    " Now fast forward to some years later.": 1,
    "I wrote a novel about a man who, among other things, beats his wife and whose story doesn't end very well.": 1,
    " While I was promoting the novel in Nigeria, a journalist, a nice, well-meaning man, told me he wanted to advise me.": 1,
    " And for the Nigerians here, I'm sure we're all familiar with how quick our people are to give unsolicited advice.": 1,
    " He told me that people were saying that my novel was feminist.": 1,
    "And his advice to me, and he was shaking his head sadly as he spoke,": 1,
    " was that I should never call myself a feminist because feminists are women who are unhappy because they cannot find husbands.": 1,
    " So I decided to call myself a happy feminist.": 1,
    " Then an academic, a Nigerian woman, told me that feminism was not our culture, that feminism was an African, and that I was calling myself a feminist because I had been corrupted by Western books.": 1,
    " which amused me because a lot of my early reading was decidedly un-feminist.": 1,
    "I think I must have read every single Milson Boone romance published before I was 16.": 1,
    " And each time I try to read those books called the feminist classics, I get bored and I really struggle to finish them.": 1,
    "But anyway, since feminism was un-African, I decided I would now call myself a happy African feminist.": 1,
    " At some point I was a happy African feminist who does not hate men and who likes lip gloss and who wears high heels for herself but not for men.": 1,
    " Of course a lot of this was tongue-in-cheek, but that word feminist is so heavy with baggage, negative baggage.": 1,
    "You hate men, you hate bras, you hate African culture, that sort of thing.": 1,
    "Now here's a story from my childhood.": 1,
    " When I was in primary school, my teacher said at the beginning of term that she would give the class a test.": 1,
    " And whoever got the highest score would be the class monitor.": 1,
    "Now, class monitor was a big deal.": 1,
    "If you were class monitor, you got to write down the names of noisemakers.": 1,
    " which was heavy enough power on its own.": 1,
    "But my teacher would also give you a cane to hold in your hand while you walked around and patrolled the classroom noisemakers.": 1,
    " Now, of course, you are not actually allowed to use the cane.": 1,
    " But it was an exciting prospect for the nine-year-old me.": 1,
    "I very much wanted to be the class monitor, and I got the highest score on the test.": 1,
    "Then to my surprise, my teacher said that the monitor had to be a boy.": 1,
    " She had forgotten to make that clear earlier because she assumed it was obvious.": 1,
    " A boy had the second highest score on the test and he would be monitor.": 1,
    "Now what was even more interesting about this is that the boy was a sweet gentle soul who had no interest in patrolling the class with a cane.": 1,
    " while I was full of ambitions to do so.": 1,
    "But I was female, and he was male, and so he became the class monitor.": 1,
    " and I've never forgotten that incident.": 1,
    "I often make the mistake of thinking that something that is obvious to me is just as obvious to everyone else.": 1,
    "Now take my dear friend Louie, for example.": 1,
    " Louis is a brilliant progressive man and we would have conversations and he would tell me, I don't know what you mean by things being different or harder for women.": 1,
    "Maybe in the past, but not now.": 1,
    " And I didn't understand how Louis could not see what seemed so self-evident.": 1,
    "Then one evening, in Lagos, Louis and I went out with friends.": 1,
    "And for people here who are familiar with Lagos, there's that wonderful Lagos fixture.": 1,
    " the sprinkling of energetic men who hang around outside establishments and very dramatically help you park your car.": 1,
    " I was impressed with the particular theatrics of the man who found us a parking spot that evening.": 1,
    "And so as we were leaving, I decided to give him a tip.": 1,
    " I opened my bag, put my hand inside my bag, brought out my money that I had earned from doing my work, and I gave it to the man.": 1,
    " And he, this man who was very grateful and very happy, took the money from me, looked across at Louis, and said, thank you, sir.": 1,
    " Louis looked at me surprised and asked, why is he thanking me?": 1,
    "I didn't give him the money.": 1,
    " Then I saw realization dawn on Louis' face.": 1,
    " The man believed that whatever money I had had ultimately came, had ultimately come from Louis because Louis is a man.": 1,
    " Now men and women are different.": 1,
    "We have different hormones, we have different sexual organs, we have different biological abilities.": 1,
    "Women can have babies, men can't.": 1,
    " At least not yet.": 1,
    " Men have testosterone and are in general physically stronger than women.": 1,
    "There are slightly more women than men in the world.": 1,
    "About 52% of the world's population is female.": 1,
    "But most of the positions of power and prestige are occupied by men.": 1,
    " The late Kenyan Nobel Peace Laureate, Wangari Mathai, put it simply and well when she said, the higher you go, the fewer women they are.": 1,
    " In the recent US elections, we kept hearing of the Lilly Ledbetter law.": 1,
    "And if we go beyond the nicely alliterative name of that law, it was really about a man and a woman doing the same job, being equally qualified,": 1,
    " and the man being paid more because he's a man.": 1,
    " So in a literal way, men rule the world.": 1,
    "And this made sense a thousand years ago.": 1,
    "Because human beings lived then in a world in which physical strength was the most important attribute for survival.": 1,
    " the physically stronger person was more likely to lead.": 1,
    " And men in general are physically stronger.": 1,
    "Of course, there are many exceptions.": 1,
    " But today we live in a vastly different world.": 1,
    "The person more likely to lead is not the physically stronger person.": 1,
    "It is the more creative person, the more intelligent person, the more innovative person.": 1,
    " And there are no hormones for those attributes.": 1,
    "A man is as likely as a woman to be intelligent, to be creative, to be innovative.": 1,
    "We have evolved, but it seems to me that our ideas of gender have not evolved.": 1,
    " Some weeks ago, I walked into the lobby of one of the best Nigerian hotels.": 1,
    "I thought about naming the hotel, but I thought I probably shouldn't.": 1,
    "And a guard at the entrance stopped me and asked me annoying questions.": 1,
    " Because their automatic assumption is that a Nigerian female walking into a hotel alone is a sex walker.": 1,
    " And by the way, why do these hotels focus on the ostensible supply rather than the demand for sex workers?": 1,
    " In Lagos, I cannot go alone into many reputable bars and clubs.": 1,
    "They just don't let you in if you're a woman alone.": 1,
    "You have to be accompanied by a man.": 1,
    " Each time I walk into a Nigerian restaurant with a man, the waiter greets the man and ignores me.": 1,
    " The waiters are products.": 1,
    " Are there some women who are like, yes?": 1,
    "The waiters are products of a society that has taught them that men are more important than women.": 1,
    " And I know the waiters don't intend any harm, but it is one thing to know intellectually and quite another to feel it emotionally.": 1,
    "Each time they ignore me, I feel invisible.": 1,
    "I feel upset.": 1,
    " I want to tell them that I am just as human as the man, that I am just as worthy of acknowledgement.": 1,
    "These are little things, but sometimes it's the little things that sting the most.": 1,
    " Not long ago I wrote an article about what it means to be young and female in Lagos and an acquaintance told me it was so angry.": 1,
    "Of course it was angry.": 1,
    " I am angry.": 1,
    "Gender as it functions today is a grave injustice.": 1,
    "We should all be angry.": 1,
    "Anger has a long history of bringing about positive change, but in addition to being angry, I'm also hopeful.": 1,
    " because I believe deeply in the ability of human beings to make and remake themselves for the better.": 1,
    " Gender matters everywhere in the world, but I want to focus on Nigeria.": 1,
    " and on Africa in general, because it is where I know and because it is where my heart is.": 1,
    "And I would like today to ask that we begin to dream about and plan for a different world, a fairer world.": 1,
    " A world of happier men and happier women who are truer to themselves.": 1,
    "And this is how to start.": 1,
    "We must raise our daughters differently.": 1,
    "We must also raise our sons differently.": 1,
    " We do a great disservice to boys in how we raise them.": 1,
    "We stifle the humanity of boys.": 1,
    "We define masculinity in a very narrow way.": 1,
    "Masculinity becomes this hard, small cage, and we put boys inside the cage.": 1,
    " We teach boys to be afraid of fear.": 1,
    "We teach boys to be afraid of weakness, of vulnerability.": 1,
    "We teach them to mask their true selves because they have to be, in Nigeria speak, hard man.": 1,
    " In secondary school, a boy and a girl, both of them teenagers, both of them with the same amount of pocket money, would go out and the boy would be expected always to pay to prove his masculinity.": 1,
    " And yet we wonder why boys are more likely to steal money from their parents.": 1,
    " What if both boys and girls were raised not to link masculinity with money?": 1,
    "What if their attitude was not, the boy has to pay, but rather, whoever has more should pay?": 1,
    " Now, of course, because of their historical advantage, it is mostly men who will have more today.": 1,
    "But if we start raising children differently, then in 50 years, in 100 years, boys will no longer have the pressure of having to prove this masculinity.": 1,
    " But by far the worst thing we do to males by making them feel that they have to be hard is that we leave them with very fragile egos.": 1,
    "The more hard man a man feels compelled to be,": 1,
    " the weaker his ego is.": 1,
    " And then we do a much greater disservice to girls because we raise them to cater to the fragile egos of men.": 1,
    "We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller.": 1,
    "We say to girls, you can have ambition, but not too much.": 1,
    " You should aim to be successful, but not too successful, otherwise you will threaten the man.": 1,
    "If you are the breadwinner in your relationship with the man, you have to pretend that you're not, especially in public, otherwise you will emasculate him.": 1,
    " But what if we question the premise itself?": 1,
    "Why should a woman's success be a threat to a man?": 1,
    "What if we decide to simply dispose of that word?": 1,
    "And I don't think there's an English word I dislike more than emasculation.": 1,
    " A Nigerian acquaintance once asked me if I was worried that men would be intimidated by me.": 1,
    "I was not worried at all.": 1,
    "In fact, it had not occurred to me to be worried because a man who would be intimidated by me is exactly the kind of man I would have no interest in.": 1,
    " But still, I was really struck by this.": 1,
    "Because I am female, I'm expected to aspire to marriage.": 1,
    "I'm expected to make my life choices, always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important.": 1,
    " Now marriage can be a good thing.": 1,
    "It can be a source of joy and love and mutual support.": 1,
    "But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same?": 1,
    " I know a woman who decided to sell her house because she didn't want to intimidate a man who might marry her.": 1,
    " I know an unmarried woman in Nigeria who when she goes to conferences wears a wedding ring because according to her she wants the other participants in the conference to give her respect.": 1,
    " I know young women who are under so much pressure from family, from friends, even from work, to get married.": 1,
    "And they're pushed to make terrible choices.": 1,
    " A woman at a certain age who is unmarried, our society teaches her to see it as a deep personnel failure.": 1,
    "And a man at a certain age who is unmarried, we just think he hasn't come around to making his pick.": 1,
    " It's easy for us to say, oh, but women can just say no to all of this.": 1,
    "But the reality is more difficult and more complex.": 1,
    " We're all social beings.": 1,
    "We internalize ideas from our socialization.": 1,
    "Even the language we use in talking about marriage and relationships illustrates this.": 1,
    "The language of marriage is often a language of ownership rather than a language of partnership.": 1,
    " We use the word respect to mean something a woman shows a man, but often not something a man shows a woman.": 1,
    " Both men and women in Nigeria will say, and this is an expression I'm very amused by, I did it for peace in my marriage.": 1,
    " Now when men say it, it is usually about something that they should not be doing anyway.": 1,
    " Sometimes they say to their friends, it's something they say to their friends in a kind of fungly, exasperated way.": 1,
    "You know, something that ultimately proves how masculine they are, how needed, how loved.": 1,
    " Oh, my wife said I can't go to the club every night.": 1,
    "So for peace in my marriage, I do it only on weekends.": 1,
    " Now when a woman says, I did it for peace in my marriage, she's usually talking about having given up a job, a dream, a career.": 1,
    " We teach females that in relationships compromise is what women do.": 1,
    " We raise girls to see each other as competitors, not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing, but for the attention of men.": 1,
    " We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are.": 1,
    "If we have sons, we don't mind knowing about our son's girlfriends, but our daughter's boyfriends, God forbid.": 1,
    " But of course, when the time is right, we expect those girls to bring back the perfect man to be their husband.": 1,
    "We police girls, we praise girls for virginity, but we don't praise boys for virginity.": 1,
    "And it's always made me wonder how exactly this is supposed to work out because...": 1,
    " I mean the loss of virginity is usually a process that involves": 1,
    " Recently, a young woman was gang raped in a university in Nigeria.": 1,
    "I think some of us know about that.": 1,
    "And the response of many young Nigerians, both male and female, was something along the lines of this.": 1,
    "Yes, rape is wrong.": 1,
    " But what is a girl doing in a room with four boys?": 1,
    "Now if we can forget the horrible inhumanity of that response, these Nigerians have been raised to think of women as inherently guilty.": 1,
    " And there have been ways to expect so little of men that the idea of men as savage beings without any control is somehow acceptable.": 1,
    " We teach girls shame.": 1,
    "Close your legs, cover yourself.": 1,
    " We make them feel as though by being born female, they're already guilty of something.": 1,
    "And so girls grow up to be women who cannot see they have desire.": 1,
    "They grow up to be women who silence themselves.": 1,
    " They grow up to be women who cannot say what they truly think.": 1,
    "And they grow up, and this is the worst thing we do to girls, they grow up to be women who have turned pretense into an art form.": 1,
    " I know a woman who hates domestic work.": 1,
    "She just hates it.": 1,
    "But she pretends that she likes it.": 1,
    " Because she's been taught that to be good wife material, she has to be, to use that Nigerian word, very homely.": 1,
    " And then she got married.": 1,
    "And after a while, her husband's family began to complain that she had changed.": 1,
    " Actually, she had not changed.": 1,
    "She just got tired of pretending.": 1,
    "The problem with gender is that it prescribes how we should be rather than recognizing how we are.": 1,
    " Now imagine how much happier we would be, how much freer to be our true individual selves if we didn't have the weight of gender expectations.": 1,
    " Boys and girls are undeniably different biologically, but socialization exaggerates the differences, and then it becomes a self-fulfilling process.": 1,
    "Now, take cooking, for example.": 1,
    " Today, women in general are more likely to do the housework than men, the cooking and cleaning.": 1,
    "But why is that?": 1,
    "Is it because women are born with a cooking gene?": 1,
    " or because over years they have been socialized to see cooking as their role.": 1,
    "Actually, I was going to say that maybe women are born with a cooking gene, until I remembered that the majority of the famous cooks in the world who we give the fancy title of chefs are men.": 1,
    " I used to look at my grandmother who was a brilliant, brilliant woman and wonder how she would have been if she had the same opportunities as men when she was growing up.": 1,
    " Now today there are many more opportunities for women than there were during my grandmother's time because of changes in policy, changes in law, all of which are very important.": 1,
    " But what matters even more is our attitude, our mindset, what we believe and what we value about gender.": 1,
    "What if, in raising children, we focus on ability instead of gender?": 1,
    " What if in raising children we focus on interest instead of gender?": 1,
    " I know a family who have a son and a daughter, both of whom are brilliant at school, who are wonderful, lovely children.": 1,
    "When the boy is hungry, the parents say to the girl, go and cook Indomie noodles for your brother.": 1,
    " Now the girl doesn't particularly like to cook Indomie noodles, but she's a girl and so she has to.": 1,
    "Now what if the parents from the beginning taught both the boy and the girl to cook Indomie?": 1,
    " Cooking, by the way, is a very useful skill for a boy to have.": 1,
    "I've never thought it made sense to leave such a crucial thing, the ability to nourish oneself.": 1,
    " in the hands of others.": 1,
    " I know a woman who has the same degree and the same job as her husband.": 1,
    "When they get back from work, she does most of the housework, which I think is true for many marriages.": 1,
    "But what struck me about them was that whenever her husband changed the baby's diaper,": 1,
    " She said thank you to him.": 1,
    " Now what if she saw this as perfectly normal and natural, that he should in fact care for his child?": 1,
    " I'm trying to unlearn many of the lessons of gender that I internalized when I was growing up, but I sometimes still feel very vulnerable in the face of gender expectations.": 1,
    "The first time I taught a writing class in graduate school,": 1,
    " I was worried.": 1,
    "I wasn't worried about the material I would teach because I was well prepared and I was going to teach what I enjoyed teaching.": 1,
    "Instead, I was worried about what to wear.": 1,
    " I want it to be taken seriously.": 1,
    " I knew that because I was female I would automatically have to prove my worth.": 1,
    "And I was worried that if I looked too feminine I would not be taken seriously.": 1,
    "I really wanted to wear my shiny lip gloss and my girly skirt.": 1,
    " But I decided not to.": 1,
    "Instead, I wore a very serious, very manly, and very ugly suit.": 1,
    " Because the sad truth is that when it comes to appearance, we start off with men as the standard, as the norm.": 1,
    "If a man is getting ready for a business meeting, he doesn't worry about looking too masculine and therefore not being taken for granted.": 1,
    " If a woman is getting ready for a business meeting, she has to worry about looking too feminine and what it says and whether or not she will be taken seriously.": 1,
    "I wish I had not worn that ugly suit that day.": 1,
    " I've actually banished it from my closet by the way.": 1,
    "Had I then the confidence that I have now to be myself, my students would have benefited even more from my teaching because I would have been more comfortable and more fully and more truly myself.": 1,
    " I have chosen to no longer be apologetic for my femaleness and for my femininity.": 1,
    " And I want to be respected in all of my femaleness because I deserve to be.": 1,
    "Gender is not an easy conversation to have.": 1,
    " For both men and women, to bring up gender is sometimes to encounter an almost immediate resistance.": 1,
    "I can imagine some people here actually thinking, women too do safe.": 1,
    " Some of the men here might be thinking, okay, all of this is interesting, but I don't think like that.": 1,
    " And that is part of the problem.": 1,
    "That many men do not actively think about gender or notice gender.": 1,
    "It's part of the problem of gender.": 1,
    "That many men say, like my friend Louie, that everything is fine now.": 1,
    " and that many men do nothing to change it.": 1,
    "If you are a man and you walk into a restaurant with a woman and the waiter greets only you, does it occur to you to ask the waiter, why haven't you greeted her?": 1,
    " Because gender can be...": 1,
    " Actually, women rapper was part of the longer version of this talk.": 1,
    " So because gender can be very uncomfortable conversation to have, there are very easy ways to close it, to close the conversation.": 1,
    "So some people will bring up evolutionary biology.": 1,
    " and apes, how female apes bow down to male apes and that sort of thing.": 1,
    "But the point is we're not apes.": 1,
    " Apes also live on trees and have earthworms for breakfast and we don't.": 1,
    " Some people will say, well, poor men also have a hard time.": 1,
    "And this is true.": 1,
    " But that is not what this is.": 1,
    " But this is not what this conversation is about.": 1,
    " Gender and class are different forms of oppression.": 1,
    "I actually learned quite a bit about systems of oppression and how they can be blind to one another by talking to black men.": 1,
    " I was once talking to a black man about gender, and he said to me, why do you have to say my experience as a woman?": 1,
    "Why can't it be your experience as a human being?": 1,
    " Now this was the same man who would often talk about his experience as a black man.": 1,
    " Gender matters, men and women experience the world differently.": 1,
    "Gender colors the way we experience the world.": 1,
    "But we can change that.": 1,
    " Some people will say, oh, but women have the real power, bottom power.": 1,
    "And for non-Nigerians, bottom power is an expression which I suppose means something like a woman who uses her sexuality to get favors from men.": 1,
    " But bottom power is not power at all.": 1,
    " Bottom power means that a woman simply has a good route to tap into from time to time somebody else's power.": 1,
    " And then of course we have to wonder what happens when that somebody else is in a bad mood or sick or impotent.": 1,
    " Some people will say that a woman being subordinate to a man is our culture.": 1,
    "But culture is constantly changing.": 1,
    "I have beautiful twin nieces who are 15 and live in Lagos.": 1,
    " If they had been born a hundred years ago, they would have been taken away and killed because it was our culture, it was Igbo culture to kill twins.": 1,
    " So what is the point of culture?": 1,
    "I mean, there's the decorative, the dancing, but also culture really is about preservation and continuity of a people.": 1,
    " In my family, I am the child who is most interested in the story of who we are, in our traditions, in the knowledge of ancestral lands.": 1,
    "My brothers are not as interested as I am, but I cannot participate.": 1,
    "I cannot go to Munna meetings.": 1,
    " I cannot have a say because I am female.": 1,
    " Culture does not make people.": 1,
    "People make culture.": 1,
    " So if it is in fact true...": 1,
    " So if it is in fact true that the full humanity of women is not our culture, then we must make it our culture.": 1,
    " I think, I think very often of my dear friend, Okoloma Madwe Wesse.": 1,
    "May he and all the others who passed away in that Sosoliso crash continue to rest in peace.": 1,
    " He will always be remembered by those of us who loved him.": 1,
    " And he was right that day many years ago when he called me a feminist.": 1,
    " I am a feminist.": 1,
    "And when I looked up the word in the dictionary that day, this is what it said.": 1,
    "Feminist.": 1,
    "A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes.": 1,
    " My great grandmother, from the stories I've heard, was a feminist.": 1,
    "She ran away from the house of the man she did not want to marry and ended up marrying the man of her choice.": 1,
    " She refused, she protested, she spoke up whenever she felt she was being deprived of access, of land, that sort of thing.": 1,
    "My great grandmother did not know that word feminist, but it doesn't mean that she wasn't one.": 1,
    " More of us should reclaim that word.": 1,
    " My own definition of feminist is, a feminist is a man or a woman who says,": 1,
