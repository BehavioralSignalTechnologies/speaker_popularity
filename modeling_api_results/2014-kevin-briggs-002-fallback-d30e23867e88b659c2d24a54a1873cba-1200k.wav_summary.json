    " I recently retired from the California Highway Patrol after 23 years of service.": 1,
    "The majority of those 23 years was spent patrolling the southern end of Marin County, which includes the Golden Gate Bridge.": 1,
    " The bridge is an iconic structure known worldwide for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architecture.": 1,
    " Unfortunately, there's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most utilized sites in the world.": 1,
    " The Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937.": 1,
    "Joseph Strauss, chief engineer in charge of building the bridge, was quoted as saying, the bridge is practically suicide-proof.": 1,
    " Suicide from the bridge is neither practical nor probable.": 1,
    "But since its opening, over 1,600 people have leapt to their death from that bridge.": 1,
    " Some believe that traveling between the two towers will lead you to another dimension.": 1,
    "This bridge has been romanticized as such.": 1,
    "That the fall from that frees you from all your worries and grief.": 1,
    " and the waters below will cleanse your soul.": 1,
    "But let me tell you what actually occurs when the bridge is used as a means of suicide.": 1,
    "After a free fall of four to five seconds,": 1,
    " The body strikes the water at about 75 miles an hour.": 1,
    " That impact shatters bones, some of which then puncture vital organs.": 1,
    " Most die on impact.": 1,
    "Those that don't generally flail in the water helplessly and then drown.": 1,
    " I don't think that those who contemplate this method of suicide realize how grisly a death that they face.": 1,
    " This is the cord.": 1,
    "Except for around the two towers, there's 32 inches of steel paralleling the bridge.": 1,
    "This is where most folks stand before taking their lives.": 1,
    " I can tell you from experience that once the person is on that cord, and at their darkest time, it is very difficult to bring them back.": 1,
    " I took this photo last year as this young woman spoke to an officer contemplating her life.": 1,
    "I want to tell you very happily that we were successful that day in getting her back over the rail.": 1,
    " When I first began working on the bridge, we had no formal training.": 1,
    "You struggled to fumble your way through these calls.": 1,
    " This was not only to service to those contemplating suicide, but to the officers as well.": 1,
    " We've come a long, long way since then.": 1,
    "Now, veteran officers and psychologists train new officers.": 1,
    " This is Jason Garber.": 1,
    "I met Jason on July 22 of last year when I received a call of a possible suicidal subject sitting on the court near mid-span.": 1,
    "I responded, and when I arrived,": 1,
    " I observed Jason speaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer.": 1,
    " Jason was just 32 years old and had flown out here from New Jersey.": 1,
    "As a matter of fact, he had flown out here on two other occasions from New Jersey to attempt suicide on this bridge.": 1,
    " After about an hour of speaking with Jason,": 1,
    " He asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's Box.": 1,
    " Recalling your Greek mythology, Zeus created Pandora and sent her down to Earth with a box and told her, never, ever open that box.": 1,
    " One day, Curiosity got the better of Pandora, and she did open the box.": 1,
    " out flew plagues, sorrows, and all sorts of evils against man.": 1,
    " The only good thing in the box was hope.": 1,
    " Jason then asked us,": 1,
    " What happens when you open the box and hope isn't there?": 1,
    " He paused a few moments.": 1,
    " leaned to his right.": 1,
    " and was gone.": 1,
    " this kind, intelligent young man from New Jersey had just committed suicide.": 1,
    " I spoke with Jason's parents that evening, and I suppose that when I was speaking with them that I didn't sound as if I was doing very well.": 1,
    " Because that very next day, their family rabbi called the check on me.": 1,
    "Jason's parents had asked him to do so.": 1,
    " The collateral damage of suicide affects so many people.": 1,
    " I pose these questions to you.": 1,
    " What would you do if your family member, friend, or loved one was suicidal?": 1,
    "What would you say?": 1,
    "Would you know what to say?": 1,
    " In my experience, it's not just the talking that you do, but the listening.": 1,
    " Listen to understand.": 1,
    " Don't argue, blame or tell the person you know how they feel.": 1,
    " because you probably don't.": 1,
    " by just being there.": 1,
    " You may just be the turning point that they need.": 1,
    " If you think someone is suicidal, don't be afraid to confront them and ask the question.": 1,
    " One way of asking the question is like this.": 1,
    " others in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life.": 1,
    "Have you had these thoughts?": 1,
    "Confronting the person head-on": 1,
    " may just save their life and be a turning point for them.": 1,
    " Some other signs to look for?": 1,
    "Hopelessness.": 1,
    "Believing that things are terrible and never going to get better.": 1,
    " helplessness, believing that there is nothing that you can do about it.": 1,
    " recent social withdrawal, and loss of interest in life.": 1,
    " I came with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I received an email from a lady that liked to read you her letter.": 1,
    "She lost her son on": 1,
    " January 19th of this year.": 1,
    " And she wrote me this email just a couple of days ago.": 1,
    " And it's with her permission and blessing that I read this to you.": 1,
    " Hi Kevin, I imagine you're at the TED conference.": 1,
    " That must be quite the experience to be there.": 1,
    "I'm thinking I should go walk the bridge this weekend.": 1,
    "Just wanted to drop you a note.": 1,
    " Hope you get the word out to many people, and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, et cetera.": 1,
    " I'm still pretty numb, but noticing more moments of really realizing Mike isn't coming home.": 1,
    " Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco to watch the 49er game with his father on January 19th.": 1,
    "He never made it there.": 1,
    " I called Petaluma Police and reported him missing that evening.": 1,
    "The next morning two officers came to my home.": 1,
    " and reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge.": 1,
    " A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge at 1.58 pm the previous day.": 1,
    " Thanks so much for standing up for those who may be only temporarily too weak to stand for themselves.": 1,
    " Who hasn't been low before without suffering from a true mental illness?": 1,
    " It shouldn't be so easy to end it.": 1,
    " My prayers are with you for your fight.": 1,
    " the GGB Golden Gate Bridge.": 1,
    " is supposed to be a passage across our beautiful bay, not a graveyard.": 1,
    " Good luck this week, Vicki.": 1,
    " I can't imagine the courage it takes for her to go down to that bridge and walk the path that her son took that day.": 1,
    " and also the courage just to carry on.": 1,
    " I'd like to introduce you to a man I refer to as hope and courage.": 1,
    " On March 11, 2005, I responded to a radio call of a possible suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk near the North Tower.": 1,
    " I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk and observed this man, Kevin Berthea, standing on the sidewalk.": 1,
    " When he saw me, he immediately traversed that pedestrian rail and stood on that small pipe which goes around the tower.": 1,
    " For the next hour and a half, I listened as Kevin spoke about his depression and hopelessness.": 1,
    " Kevin decided on his own that day to come back over that rail and give life another chance.": 1,
    " When Kevin came back over, I congratulated him.": 1,
    "This is a new beginning, a new life.": 1,
    "But I asked him,": 1,
    " What was it that made you come back and give hope and life another chance?": 1,
    "You know what he told me?": 1,
    " He said, you listened.": 1,
    "You let me speak and you just listened.": 1,
    " Shortly after this incident, I received a letter from Kevin's mother, and I have that letter with me.": 1,
    " and I'd like to read it to you.": 1,
    " Dear Mr. Briggs, Nothing will erase the events of March 11th, but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us.": 1,
    "I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help.": 1,
    " He has been diagnosed with a mental illness for which he has been properly medicated.": 1,
    "I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old, completely unaware of any hereditary traits.": 1,
    " But thank God, now we know.": 1,
    "Kevin is straight as he says.": 1,
    "We truly thank God for you.": 1,
    "Sincerely indebted to you, Narvela Berthia.": 1,
    " And on the bottom, she writes, PS.": 1,
    " When I visited San Francisco General Hospital that evening, you were listed as the patient.": 1,
    "Boy, did I have to straighten that one out.": 1,
    " Today,": 1,
    " Kevin is a loving father and contributing member of society.": 1,
    "He speaks openly about the events that day and his depression in the hopes that his story will inspire others.": 1,
    " Suicide is not just something I've encountered on the job.": 1,
    "It's personal.": 1,
    "My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning.": 1,
    " That act, although ending his own pain, robbed me from ever getting to know him.": 1,
    " This is what suicide does.": 1,
    " For most suicidal folks, or those contemplating suicide, they wouldn't think of hurting another person.": 1,
    "They just want their own pain to end.": 1,
    " Typically, this is accomplished in just three ways.": 1,
    "Sleep, drugs or alcohol, or death.": 1,
    " In my career, I've responded to and been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.": 1,
    " Of those incidents I've been directly involved with, I've only lost two.": 1,
    "But that's two too many.": 1,
    "One was Jason.": 1,
    "The other was a man I spoke to for about an hour.": 1,
    " During that time, he shook my hand on three occasions.": 1,
    " On that final handshake, he looked at me and he said, Kevin, I'm sorry, but I have to go.": 1,
    " And he leapt.": 1,
    " Horrible, absolutely horrible.": 1,
    "I do want to tell you though, the vast majority of folks that we do get to contact on that bridge do not commit suicide.": 1,
    " Additionally, that very few who have jumped off the bridge and lived and can talk about it, that one to two percent": 1,
    " Most of those folks have said that the second that they let go of that rail, they knew that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.": 1,
    " I tell people the bridge not only connects Marin to San Francisco, but people together also.": 1,
    " That connection or bridge that we make is something that each and every one of us should strive to do.": 1,
    " Suicide is preventable.": 1,
    " There is help.": 1,
    "There is hope.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
