    " As an artist, connection is very important to me.": 1,
    "Through my work, I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected.": 1,
    " I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago where I saw my first icebergs.": 1,
    "I was in awe.": 1,
    " My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.": 1,
    "The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water.": 1,
    " And I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year.": 1,
    " Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves.": 1,
    " Each iceberg has its own individual personality.": 1,
    "They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.": 1,
    " Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.": 1,
    " It's easy to think when you look at an iceberg that they're isolated, that they're separate and alone.": 1,
    "Much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves, but the reality is far from it.": 1,
    " As an iceberg melts, I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere.": 1,
    "As the iceberg melts, it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life.": 1,
    " I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again.": 1,
    " It is not a death when they melt.": 1,
    "It is not an end, but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life.": 1,
    " Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young, a couple thousand years old.": 1,
    "And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old.": 1,
    " The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Kakotosuak, Greenland.": 1,
    "It's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling.": 1,
    " So here it is.": 1,
    "You can see on the left side a small boat that's about a 15 foot boat.": 1,
    "And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the water line.": 1,
    " You can see here it begins to roll and the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.": 1,
    "This is an average size Greenlandic iceberg.": 1,
    "It's about 120 feet above the water or 40 meters.": 1,
    "And this video is real time.": 1,
    " And just like that, the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
