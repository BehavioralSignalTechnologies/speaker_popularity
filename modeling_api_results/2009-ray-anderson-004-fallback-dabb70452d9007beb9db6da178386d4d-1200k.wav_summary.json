    " Believe it or not, I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem with the requisite focus on climate.": 1,
    "And the solution I offer": 1,
    " is to the biggest culprit in the massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind and the resulting decline of the biosphere.": 1,
    "That culprit is business and industry.": 1,
    " which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956 as an industrial engineer, come aspiring and then successful entrepreneur.": 1,
    " After founding my company, Interface, from scratch in 1973, 36 years ago, to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets.": 1,
    " and shepherding it through startup and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field, I read Paul Hawkins' book, The Ecology of Commerce, the sum of 1994.": 1,
    " In his book, Paul charges business and industry as one of the major culprit": 1,
    " in causing the decline of the biosphere and two, the only institution that is large enough and pervasive enough and powerful enough to really lead humankind out of this mess.": 1,
    " And by the way, he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth.": 1,
    "And I then challenged the people of Interface, my company, to lead our company in the entire industrial world.": 1,
    " to sustainability, which we defined as eventually operating a petroleum intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth": 1,
    " only what can be renewed by the earth naturally and rapidly, not another fresh drop of oil, and to do no harm to the biosphere.": 1,
    " Take nothing, do no harm.": 1,
    "I simply said, if Hawking is right and business and industry must lead, who will lead business and industry?": 1,
    "Unless somebody leads, nobody will.": 1,
    "It's axiomatic.": 1,
    "Why not us?": 1,
    " And thanks to the people of Interface, I have become a recovering plunderer.": 1,
    " I once told a Fortune magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail, and that became the headline of a Fortune article that went on to describe me as America's greenest CEO.": 1,
    " from plunderer to recovering plunderer to America's greenest CEO in five years.": 1,
    "That frankly was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999.": 1,
    " As later in the Canadian documentary, The Corporation, what I meant by the go to jail remark, I offered that theft is a crime and theft of our children's future would someday be a crime.": 1,
    " But I realize for that to be true, for theft of our children's future to be a crime, there must be a clear demonstrable alternative.": 1,
    " to the take, make, waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization and is the major culprit stealing our children's future by digging up the earth": 1,
    " and converting it to products that quickly become waste in the landfill or an incinerator.": 1,
    "In short, digging up the earth and converting it to pollution.": 1,
    " According to Paul and Ann Ehrlich and their well-known environmental impact equation, impact, a bad thing, is the product of population affluence and technology.": 1,
    "That is, impact is generated by people.": 1,
    " what they consume in their affluence and how it is produced.": 1,
    " I know the equation is largely subjective.": 1,
    "You can perhaps quantify people and perhaps quantify affluence, but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify, so the equation is conceptual.": 1,
    "Still, it works to help us understand the problem.": 1,
    " So we set out at Interface in 1994 to create an example to transform the way we made carpet.": 1,
    " a petroleum intensive product for materials as well as energy, and to transform our technologies so they diminish environmental impact rather than multiply it.": 1,
    " Paulin and Ehrlich's environmental impact equation, I is equal to P times A times T. Population, affluence and technology, I wanted interface to rewrite that equation so that it read": 1,
    " I equal P times A divided by T. Now the mathematically magnitude, we'll see immediately that T in the numerator increases impact, a bad thing, but T in the denominator decreases impact.": 1,
    " So I asked what would move T, technology, from the numerator, call it T1, where it increases impact, to the denominator.": 1,
    "Call it T2, where it reduces impact.": 1,
    " I thought about the characteristics of": 1,
    " first industrial revolution T1 as we practiced it identifies and it had the following characteristics.": 1,
    " Extractive, taking raw materials from the earth.": 1,
    "Linear, take, make, waste.": 1,
    "Powered by fossil fuel derived energy.": 1,
    "Wasteful, abusive, and focused on labor productivity.": 1,
    " more carpet per man hour.": 1,
    "Thinking it through, I realized that all those attributes must be changed to move t to the denominator.": 1,
    " In the new industrial revolution, extractive must be replaced by renewable.": 1,
    "Linear by cyclical.": 1,
    "Fossil fuel energy by renewable energy sunlight.": 1,
    " Wasteful by waste free and abusive by benign and labor productivity by resource productivity.": 1,
    " And I reason that if we could make those transformative changes and get rid of T1 altogether, we could reduce our impact to zero.": 1,
    " including our impact on the climate.": 1,
    "And that became the interface plan in 1995 and has been the plan ever since.": 1,
    "We have measured our progress very rigorously.": 1,
    " So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years.": 1,
    "Net greenhouse gas emissions down 82 percent, an absolute tonnage.": 1,
    " Over the same span of time, sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled.": 1,
    "So an 82 percent absolute reduction translates into a 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales.": 1,
    " This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate disruptions, so the scientists are telling us.": 1,
    " Fossil fuel usage is down 60% per unit of production due to efficiencies in renewables.": 1,
    "The cheapest, most secure barrel of all there is, is the one not used.": 1,
    " through efficiencies.": 1,
    "Water usage is down 75% in our worldwide carpet tile business, down 40% in our broadland carpet business, which we acquired in 1993 right here in California, city of industry, where water is so precious.": 1,
    " Renewable or recycled materials in at 25% of the total and growing rapidly.": 1,
    "Renewable energy is 27% of our total, going for 100%.": 1,
    " We have diverted 148 million pounds, that's 74,000 tons of used carpet from landfills.": 1,
    " closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post-consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago.": 1,
    " Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate neutral carpet.": 1,
    " since 2004, meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain from mine and well-hit": 1,
    " clear to end of life reclamation, independent third party certified.": 1,
    "We call it cool carpet.": 1,
    "And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator, increasing sales and profits.": 1,
    "Three years ago,": 1,
    " We launched carpet tile for the home under the brand Floor, misspelled F-L-O-R.": 1,
    "You can point and click today at floor.com and have cool carpet delivered to your front door in five days.": 1,
    " It is practical and pretty, too.": 1,
    " We reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal, zero impact, zero footprint.": 1,
    "We've set 2020 as our target year for zero, for reaching the top, the summit of Mount sustainability.": 1,
    " We call this mission zero.": 1,
    "And this is perhaps the most important fact that we have found mission zero to be in": 1,
    " incredibly good for business.": 1,
    "A better business model, a better way to bigger profits.": 1,
    "Here's the business case for sustainability from real life experience.": 1,
    "Costs are down, not up.": 1,
    " reflecting some $400 million of avoided cost in pursuit of zero waste, the first phase of mount sustainability.": 1,
    "This has paid all the cost for the transformation of interface.": 1,
    " and dispels a myth to this false choice between the environment and the economy.": 1,
    "Our products are the best they've ever been, inspired by design for sustainability and unexpected wellspring of innovation.": 1,
    " Our people are galvanized around the shared higher purpose.": 1,
    "You cannot beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together.": 1,
    " And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing.": 1,
    "No amount of advertising, no clever marketing campaign at any price could have produced or created as much goodwill.": 1,
    " Costs, products, people, marketplace.": 1,
    "What else is there?": 1,
    "It is a better business model.": 1,
    "And here's our 14-year record of sales and profits.": 1,
    " There's a dip there from 2001 to 2003, a dip when our sales over a three-year period were down 17%.": 1,
    "But the marketplace was down 36%.": 1,
    "We literally gained market share.": 1,
    "We might not have survived that.": 1,
    " recession, but for the advantages of sustainability.": 1,
    "If every business we're pursuing the interface": 1,
    " Would that solve all our problems?": 1,
    "I don't think so.": 1,
    "I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation, I equal P times A divided by T2.": 1,
    "That A is a capital A.": 1,
    " suggesting that affluence is an end in itself.": 1,
    " But what if we reframed Ehrlich further?": 1,
    " And what if we made a lower case, suggesting that it's a means to an end, and that end is happiness.": 1,
    "More happiness with less stuff.": 1,
    "You know, that would reframe civilization itself.": 1,
    " and our whole system of economics, if not for our species, then perhaps for the one that succeeds us, the sustainable species, living on a finite earth, ethically, happily, and ecologically": 1,
    " in balance with nature and all her natural systems for 1,000 generations or 10,000 generations, that is to say into the indefinite future.": 1,
    " Does the Earth have to wait for our extinction as a species?": 1,
    "Well, maybe so, but I don't think so.": 1,
    "At Interface, we really intend to bring this prototypical, sustainable, zero-footprint industrial company fully into existence": 1,
    " by 2020.": 1,
    "We can see our way now, clear to the top of that mountain, and now the challenge is in execution.": 1,
    "And as my good friend and advisor, Amory Lovins, says, if something exists, it must be possible.": 1,
    " If we can actually do it, it must be possible.": 1,
    "If we, a petro-intensive company, can do it, anybody can.": 1,
    "And if anybody can, it follows that everybody can.": 1,
    " Hawking fulfilled business and industry leading humankind away from the abyss because": 1,
    " With continued unchecked decline of the biosphere, a very dear person is at risk here, frankly, at unacceptable risk.": 1,
    "Who is that person?": 1,
    " Not you, not I, but let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here.": 1,
    "And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb on a Tuesday morning in": 1,
    " March of 1996, I was talking to our people as I did at every opportunity back then, bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting.": 1,
    " About five days later, back in Atlanta, I received an email from Glenn Thomas, one of my people in the California meeting.": 1,
    "He was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our Tuesday morning": 1,
    " together.": 1,
    "And when I read it, it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life because it told me, by God, one person got it.": 1,
    "Here's what Glenn wrote, and here's that person most at risk.": 1,
    "Please meet tomorrow's child.": 1,
    " without a name and unseen face, and knowing not your time or place.": 1,
    "Tomorrow's child, though yet unborn, I met you first last Tuesday morning.": 1,
    " A wise friend introduced us to and through his sobering point of view, I saw a day that you would see a day for you, but not for me.": 1,
    " Knowing you has changed my thinking, for I never had an inkling that perhaps the things I do might someday somehow threaten you.": 1,
    " Tomorrow's child, my daughter's son, I'm afraid I've just begun to think of you and of your good, though always having known I should.": 1,
    "Begin I will.": 1,
    " the way the cost of what I squander, what is lost, if ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too.": 1,
    " for every day of my life since.": 1,
    "Tomorrow's child has spoken to me with one simple but profound message which I presume to share with you.": 1,
    "We are each and everyone a part of the web of life.": 1,
    " The continuum of humanity is sure, but in a larger sense, the web of life itself.": 1,
    "And we have a choice to make during our brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet to hurt it or to help it.": 1,
    " For you, it's your call.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
