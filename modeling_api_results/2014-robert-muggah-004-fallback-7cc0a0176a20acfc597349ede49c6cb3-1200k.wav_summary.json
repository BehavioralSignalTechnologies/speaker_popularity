    " We can cut violent deaths around the world by 50 percent in the next three decades.": 1,
    " All we have to do is drop killing by 2.3% a year, and we'll hit that target.": 1,
    "You don't believe me?": 1,
    " Well, the leading epidemiologists and criminologists around the world seem to think we can, and so do I, but only if we focus on our cities, especially the most fragile ones.": 1,
    "You see, I've been thinking about this a lot.": 1,
    " For the last 20 years, I've been working in countries and cities ripped apart by conflict, violence, terrorism, or some insidious combination of all.": 1,
    " I've tracked gun smugglers from Russia to Somalia.": 1,
    "I've worked with warlords in Afghanistan and the Congo.": 1,
    "I've counted cadavers in Colombia, in Haiti, in Sri Lanka and Papua New Guinea.": 1,
    " You don't need to be on the front line, though, to get a sense that our planet's spinning out of control, right?": 1,
    "There's this feeling that international instability is the new normal.": 1,
    " But I want you to take a closer look, and I think you'll see that the geography of violence is changing, because it's not so much our nation states that are gripped by conflict and crime as our cities.": 1,
    " Aleppo, Bamako, Caracas, Erbil, Mosul, Tripoli, Salvador.": 1,
    "Violence is migrating to the Metropol.": 1,
    " And maybe this is to be expected, right?": 1,
    "After all, most people today, they live in cities, not the countryside.": 1,
    "Just 600 cities, including 30 megacities, account for two thirds of global GDP.": 1,
    " But when it comes to cities, the conversation is dominated by the North.": 1,
    "That is, North America, Western Europe, Australia and Japan, where violence is actually at historic lows.": 1,
    " As a result, city enthusiasts, they talk about the triumph of the city, of the creative classes, and the mayors that will rule the world.": 1,
    "Now I hope that mayors do one day rule the world.": 1,
    " But the fact is, we don't hear any conversation, really, about what's happening in the South.": 1,
    "And by South, I mean Latin America, Africa.": 1,
    " Asia, where violence in some cases is accelerating, where infrastructure is overstretched, and where governance is sometimes an aspiration and not a reality.": 1,
    " Now, some diplomats and development experts and specialists, they talk about 40 to 50 fragile states that will shape security in the 21st century.": 1,
    " I think it's fragile cities, which will define the future of order and disorder.": 1,
    "That's because warfare and humanitarian action are going to be concentrated in our cities.": 1,
    "And the fight for development, whether you define that as eradicating poverty,": 1,
    " Universal health care beating back climate change will be won or lost in the shantytown slums and favelas of our cities.": 1,
    "I want to talk to you about four mega risks that I think will define fragility in our time.": 1,
    " And if we can get to grips with these, I think we can do something with that lethal violence problem.": 1,
    " So let me start with some good news.": 1,
    "Fact is, we're living in the most peaceful moment in human history.": 1,
    "Steven Pinker and others have shown how the intensity and frequency of conflict is actually at an all-time low.": 1,
    " Now, Gaza, Syria, Sudan, Ukraine, as ghastly as these conflicts are, and they are horrific, they represent a relatively small blip upwards in a 50-year-long secular decline.": 1,
    " What's more, we're seeing a dramatic reduction in homicide.": 1,
    "Manuel Eisner and others have shown that for the centuries we've seen this incredible drop in murder, especially in the West.": 1,
    " Most northern cities today are 100 times safer than they were just 100 years ago.": 1,
    "These two facts, the decline in armed conflict and the decline in murder, are amongst the most extraordinary, if unheralded,": 1,
    " accomplishments of human history.": 1,
    "And we should be really excited, right?": 1,
    " Well, yeah, we should.": 1,
    "But there's just one problem.": 1,
    "These two scourges are still with us.": 1,
    "You see, 525,000 people, men, women, boys and girls, die violently every single year.": 1,
    " Research I've been doing with Keith Krauss and others has shown that between 50 and 60,000 people are dying in war zones, violently.": 1,
    " The rest, almost 500,000 people, are dying outside of conflict zones.": 1,
    "In other words, ten times more people are dying outside of war than inside war.": 1,
    " What's more, violence is moving south, to Latin America and the Caribbean, to parts of Central and Southern Africa, and to bits of the Middle East and Central Asia.": 1,
    " 40 of the 50 most dangerous cities in the world are right here in Latin America.": 1,
    "13 in Brazil.": 1,
    "And the most dangerous of all?": 1,
    "It's San Pedro Sula.": 1,
    " Honduras is second city with a staggering homicide rate of 187 murders per 100,000 people.": 1,
    "That's 23 times the global average.": 1,
    " Now, if violence is re-concentrating geographically, it's also being reconfigured to the world's new topography.": 1,
    "Because when it comes to cities, the world ain't flat, like Thomas Friedman likes to say.": 1,
    "It's spiky.": 1,
    " The dominance of the city as the primary mode of urban living is one of the most extraordinary demographic reversals in history.": 1,
    " And it all happened so fast.": 1,
    "I mean, you all know the figures, right?": 1,
    "There's 7.3 billion people in the world today.": 1,
    "There'll be 9.6 billion by 2050.": 1,
    "But consider this one fact.": 1,
    " In the 1800s, one in 30 people lived in cities.": 1,
    "Today, it's one in two.": 1,
    "And tomorrow, virtually everyone is going to be there.": 1,
    " And this expansion in urbanization is going to be neither even nor equitable.": 1,
    "The vast majority, 90%, will be happening in the South, in cities of the South.": 1,
    " So urban geographers and demographers, they tell us that it's not necessarily the size or even the density of cities that predicts violence, no.": 1,
    " Tokyo, with 35 million people, is one of the largest, and some might say, safest urban metropolises in the world.": 1,
    "No.": 1,
    "It's the speed of urbanisation that matters.": 1,
    "I call this turbo-urbanisation, and it's one of the key drivers": 1,
    " of fertility.": 1,
    " When you think about the incredible expansion of these cities, and you think about turbo urbanization, think about Karachi.": 1,
    "Karachi...": 1,
    " was about 500,000 people in 1947, a hustling bustling city.": 1,
    "Today, it's 21 million people.": 1,
    "And apart from accounting for three-quarters of Pakistan's GDP, it's also one of the most violent cities in South Asia.": 1,
    " DACA, Lagos, Chinchasa, these cities are now 40 times larger than they were in the 1950s.": 1,
    "Now take a look at New York.": 1,
    "The Big Apple, it took 150 years to get to eight million people.": 1,
    " Sao Paulo or Mexico took 15 to reach that same interval.": 1,
    " Now, what do these medium, large, mega and hyper cities look like?": 1,
    "What's their profile?": 1,
    "Well, for one thing, they're young.": 1,
    "What we're seeing in many of them is the rise of the youth bulge.": 1,
    " Now, this is actually a good news story.": 1,
    "It's a function of reductions in child mortality rates, right?": 1,
    "But the youth bulge is something we've got to watch.": 1,
    "What it basically means is the proportion of young people living in our fragile cities is much larger than those living in our healthier and wealthier ones.": 1,
    " In some fragile cities, 75 percent of the population is under the age of 30.": 1,
    "Think about that.": 1,
    "Three in four people are under 30.": 1,
    " It's like Palo Alto on steroids.": 1,
    "Now, if you look at Mogadishu, for example, Mogadishu, the mean age, is 16 years old.": 1,
    " Ditto for Dhaka, Delhi and Kabul.": 1,
    "And Tokyo?": 1,
    "It's 46.": 1,
    "Same for most Western European cities.": 1,
    " Now, it's not just youth that necessarily predicts violence, right?": 1,
    "That's one factor among many.": 1,
    "But youthfulness combined with unemployment, lack of education, and this is the kicker, being male is a deadly proposition.": 1,
    "They're statistically correlated, all those risk factors,": 1,
    " with youth, and they tend to relate to increases in violence.": 1,
    "Now, for those of you who are parents of teenage sons, you know what I'm talking about, right?": 1,
    "Just imagine your boy without any structure,": 1,
    " with those unruly friends of his, out there cavorting a bow.": 1,
    "Now, take away the parents, take away the education, limit the education possibilities.": 1,
    " sprinkle in a little bit of drugs, alcohol and guns, and sit back and watch the fireworks, right?": 1,
    "I mean, the implications are disconcerting.": 1,
    "Right here in Brazil, the life expectancy is 73.6 years.": 1,
    "If you live in Rio, I'm sorry, shave off two right there.": 1,
    " But if you're young, you're uneducated, you lack employment, you're black and you're male, your life expectancy drops to less than 60 years old.": 1,
    "There's a reason why youthfulness and violence are the number one killers in this country.": 1,
    " Okay, so it's not all doom and gloom in our cities, right?": 1,
    "After all, cities are hubs of innovation, dynamism, prosperity, excitement, connectivity.": 1,
    "You know, they're where the smart people gather.": 1,
    " And those young people I just mentioned, they're more digitally savvy and tech aware than ever before.": 1,
    " And this explosion in the internet and mobile technology means that the digital divide separating the north and the south between countries and within them is shrinking.": 1,
    " But as we've heard so many times, these new technologies are dual-edged, right?": 1,
    "Take the case of law enforcement.": 1,
    "Police around the world are starting to use remote sensing and big data": 1,
    " to anticipate crime.": 1,
    "Some cops are able to predict criminal violence before it even happens.": 1,
    "The future crime scenario?": 1,
    " It's here today.": 1,
    "And we've got to be careful.": 1,
    "We have to manage the issues of the public safety against rights to individual privacy, right?": 1,
    " But it's not just the cops who are innovating.": 1,
    "We've heard extraordinary activities of civil society groups who are engaging in local and global collective action, and this is leading to digital protest and real revolution.": 1,
    " But most of all are criminal gangs who are going online and starting to colonize cyberspace.": 1,
    "In Ciudad Juarez, in Mexico, where I've been working,": 1,
    " Groups like the Zetas and the Singaloa Cartel are hijacking social media.": 1,
    "They're using it to recruit, to sell their products, to coerce, to intimidate, and to kill.": 1,
    "Violence is going virtual.": 1,
    " So this is just a partial sketch of a fast-moving and dynamic and complex situation, right?": 1,
    "I mean, there are many other mega risks that are going to define fragility in our time, not least income inequality, poverty, climate change, impunity.": 1,
    " But we're facing a stark dilemma.": 1,
    " where some cities are going to thrive and drive global growth, and others are going to stumble and pull it backwards.": 1,
    "If we're going to change course, we need to start a conversation.": 1,
    "We can't only focus on those cities that work.": 1,
    " the Singapore's, the Kuala Lumpur's, the Dubai's, the Shanghai's.": 1,
    "We got to bring those fragile cities into the conversation.": 1,
    " One way to do this might be to start twinning our fragile cities with our healthier and wealthier ones, kick-starting a process of learning and collaboration and sharing of practices of what works and what doesn't.": 1,
    " A wonderful example of this is coming from El Salvador and Los Angeles where the mayors in San Salvador and Los Angeles are collaborating on getting ex-gang members to work with current gang members.": 1,
    " offering tutoring, education.": 1,
    "And in the process, they're helping incubate, cease fires and truces.": 1,
    "And we've seen homicide rates go down in San Salvador, once the world's most violent city, by 50 percent.": 1,
    " We can also focus on hot cities, but hot spots.": 1,
    "Place and location matter fundamentally in shaping violence in our cities.": 1,
    "Did you know that between 1 and 2 percent of street addresses in any fragile city can predict up to 99 percent of violent crime?": 1,
    " Take the case of Sao Paulo where I've been working.": 1,
    " In the last, it's gone from being Brazil's most dangerous city to one of its safest.": 1,
    "And it did this by doubling down on information collection, hotspot mapping and police reform.": 1,
    "And in the process, it dropped homicide by 70 percent in just over 10 years.": 1,
    " We also got to focus on those hot people.": 1,
    "It's tragic, but being young, unemployed, uneducated, male, increases the risks of being killed and killing.": 1,
    " we have to break this cycle of violence and get in there early with our children, our youngest children, and valorize them, not stigmatize them.": 1,
    " There's wonderful work that's happening that I've been involved with in Kingston, Jamaica, and right here in Rio, which is putting education, employment, recreation up front for these high-risk groups.": 1,
    "And as a result, we're seeing violence going down in their communities.": 1,
    " We've also got to make our city safer, more inclusive, and livable for all.": 1,
    "Fact is, social cohesion,": 1,
    " Matters.": 1,
    "Mobility matters in our cities.": 1,
    "We got to get away from this model of segregation, exclusion, and cities with walls.": 1,
    "My favorite example of how to do this comes from Medellin.": 1,
    "When I lived in Colombia in the late 1990s, Medellin was the murder capital of the world.": 1,
    " But it changed course.": 1,
    "And it did this by deliberately investing in its low-income and most violent areas and integrating them with a middle-class one through a network of cable cars, of public transport, and first-class infrastructure.": 1,
    "And in the process,": 1,
    " It dropped homicide by 79% in just under two decades.": 1,
    "And finally, there's technology.": 1,
    " Technology has enormous promise, but also peril.": 1,
    "We've seen examples here of extraordinary innovation, and much of it coming from this room.": 1,
    "And the police, for example, are engaging in predictive analytics.": 1,
    "Citizens are engaging in new crowdsourcing solutions.": 1,
    "Even my own group is involved in developing applications.": 1,
    " provide more accountability over police, and increase safety amongst citizens.": 1,
    "But we need to be careful.": 1,
    " If I have one single message for you, it's this.": 1,
    "There's nothing inevitable about lethal violence.": 1,
    "And we can make our cities safer.": 1,
    " Folks, we have the opportunity of a lifetime to drop homicidal violence in half within our lifetime.": 1,
    "So I have just one question.": 1,
    "What are we waiting for?": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
