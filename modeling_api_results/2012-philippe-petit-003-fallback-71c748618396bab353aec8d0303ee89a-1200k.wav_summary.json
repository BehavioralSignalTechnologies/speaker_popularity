    " Thank you.": 4,
    " so": 2,
    " this sound.": 1,
    " This smell.": 1,
    " this site.": 1,
    " all remind me of the campfires of my childhood, when anyone could become a storyteller in front of the dancing flames.": 1,
    " There was this wondrous ending when people and fire will fall asleep almost in unison.": 1,
    "It was dreaming time.": 1,
    " Now my story has a lot to do with dreaming, although I'm known to make my dreams come true.": 1,
    " Last year, I created a one-man show.": 1,
    "For an hour and a half, I shared with the audience a lifetime of creativity, how I pursue perfection, how I cheat the impossible.": 1,
    " And then Ted challenged me, Philip, can you swing this lifetime to 18 minutes?": 1,
    " 18 minutes, clearly impossible.": 1,
    " But here I am.": 1,
    " One solution was to rehearse a machine gun delivery in which every syllable, every second will have its importance.": 1,
    "And I hope the audience will be able to follow me while I... No, no, no, no.": 1,
    "No, the best way.": 1,
    " For me to start is to pay my respects to the gods of creativity.": 1,
    "So please join me for a minute of silence.": 1,
    " Okay, I cheated, it was a mere 20 seconds, but here we are on 10th time.": 1,
    " When I was six years old, I fell in love with magic.": 1,
    " For Christmas I got a magic box and a very old book on card manipulation.": 1,
    "Somehow I was more interested in pure manipulation than in all the silly little tricks in a box.": 1,
    " So, I look in the book for the most difficult move, and it was this.": 1,
    "Now, I'm not supposed to share that with you, but I have to show you the card is hidden in the back of the hand.": 1,
    " Now that manipulation was broken down into seven moves described over seven pages.": 1,
    " One, two, three, four, five, six, and seven.": 1,
    "And let me show you something else, the cards.": 1,
    " where bigger": 1,
    " than my hands.": 1,
    " Two months later, six years old, I'm able to do one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.": 1,
    "And I go to see a famous magician and proudly ask, but what do you think?": 1,
    " six years old.": 1,
    "The magician looks at me and said, this is a disaster.": 1,
    "I mean, you cannot do that in two seconds and have a minuscule part of the card showing.": 1,
    "For the move to be professional, it has to be": 1,
    " less than one second and it has to be perfect.": 1,
    " two years later.": 1,
    " And I'm not cheating, it's in the back, it's perfect.": 1,
    " Passion.": 1,
    " is the motto of all my actions.": 1,
    " As I'm studying magic, juggling is mentioned repeatedly as a great way to acquire dexterity and coordination.": 1,
    " Now, I had long admired how fast and fluidly jugglers make objects fly.": 1,
    "So that's it.": 1,
    "I'm 14.": 1,
    "I'm becoming a juggler.": 1,
    " I befriended a young juggler in a juggling troupe and he agrees to sell me three clubs.": 1,
    "In America you have to explain what are clubs, nothing to do with golf.": 1,
    " They are those beautiful oblong objects, but quite difficult to make.": 1,
    "They have to be precisely laid.": 1,
    " Oh, when I was buying the clubs, somehow the young juggler was hiding from the others.": 1,
    "I didn't think much of it at the time.": 1,
    "Anyway, here I was, progressing with my new clubs, but I could not understand.": 1,
    " I mean, I was pretty fast, but I was not fluid at all.": 1,
    "The clubs were escaping me at each throw and I was trying constantly to bring them back to me until one day...": 1,
    " I practiced in front of Francis Brun, the world's greatest juggler.": 1,
    "And he was frowning.": 1,
    "And he finally asked, can I see those?": 1,
    " So I proudly show him my clubs.": 1,
    "He said, Philippe, you have been had.": 1,
    "These are rejects.": 1,
    "They are completely out of alignment.": 1,
    "They are impossible to juggle.": 1,
    " Tenacity!": 1,
    " is how I kept at it against all odds.": 1,
    " So I went to the circus to see more magicians, more jugglers, and I saw... Oh, no, no, no.": 1,
    "I didn't see.": 1,
    "It was more interesting.": 1,
    "I heard.": 1,
    "I heard about those amazing men and women who walk on thin air.": 1,
    " the high wire walkers.": 1,
    "Now, I have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood, so that's it.": 1,
    "I'm 16 and becoming a wire walker.": 1,
    " I found two trees.": 1,
    " but not any kind of trees, trees with character.": 1,
    " and then a very long rope and I put the rope around and around and around and around until I have no more rope.": 1,
    "Now I have all those ropes parallel like this.": 1,
    "I get a pair of pliers and some coat hanger and I gather them together in some kind of ropey": 1,
    " path.": 1,
    "So I just created the widest tightrope in the world.": 1,
    "What did I need?": 1,
    "What I needed?": 1,
    "The widest shoes in the world.": 1,
    "So I found some enormous ridiculous giant ski boots": 1,
    " and then wobbly wobbly I get on the ropes.": 1,
    " Well, within a few days, I'm able to do one crossing.": 1,
    "So I cut one rope off.": 1,
    "And the next day, one rope off.": 1,
    "And a few days later, I was practicing on a single tightrope.": 1,
    " Now you can imagine at that time I had switched the ridiculous boots for some slippers, right?": 1,
    "So that is how, in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try, this is how not to learn wire walking.": 1,
    " Intuition.": 1,
    " is a tool essential in my life.": 1,
    "In the meantime, I am being thrown out of five different schools because instead of listening to the teachers, I am my own teacher.": 1,
    " progressing in my new art, and becoming a street juggler.": 1,
    "On the high wire, within months, I'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus, except I am not satisfied.": 1,
    " I am starting, I was starting to invent my own move and bring them to perfection.": 1,
    " But nobody wanted to hire me.": 1,
    "So I started putting wire in secret and performing without permission.": 1,
    "Notre Dame.": 1,
    " the Sydney Harbour Bridge.": 1,
    " the World Prayer Center, and I developed a 32-day faith that convinced me that I will get safely to the other side.": 1,
    "If not, I will never do that first step.": 1,
    " Well, nonetheless.": 1,
    " On the top of the World Trade Center, my first step was": 1,
    " Terrifying.": 1,
    " All of a sudden, the density of the air is no longer the same.": 1,
    " Manhattan no longer spreads its infinity.": 1,
    "The murmur of the city dissolved into a squall whose chill and power I no longer feel.": 1,
    " I lift the balancing pole, I approach the edge, I step over the beam, I put my left foot on the cable.": 1,
    "The weight of my body rests on my right leg anchored to the flank of the building.": 1,
    " Shall I ever so slightly shift my weight to the left?": 1,
    "My right leg will be unburdened.": 1,
    "My right foot will freely meet the wire.": 1,
    " on one side a mass of a mountain, a life I know.": 1,
    " On the other, the universe of the cloud, so full of unknown, we think it's empty.": 1,
    " At my feet, the path to the north tower, 60 yards of wire rope.": 1,
    "It's a straight line, which sags.": 1,
    " which sways, which vibrates, which rolls on itself, which is ice, which is three tons tight, ready to explode, ready to swallow me.": 1,
    " An inner howl assails me, the wild longing to flee.": 1,
    " But it is too late.": 1,
    "The wire is ready.": 1,
    " decisively, my other foot sets itself onto the cable.": 1,
    " Faith.": 1,
    " is what replaces doubt in my dictionary.": 1,
    " So after the war, people ask me, well, how can you top that?": 1,
    "Well, I didn't have that problem.": 1,
    "I mean, I was not interested in collecting the gigantic, in breaking records.": 1,
    "In fact,": 1,
    " I put my World Trade Center Crossing at the same artistic level as some of my smaller works.": 1,
    " or some completely different type of performance.": 1,
    "Let's see, such as, well, my street juggling, for example.": 1,
    " So each time I draw my circle of chalk on the pavement and enter": 1,
    " As the improvising comic silent character I created 45 years ago, I am as happy as when I am in the clouds.": 1,
    " But this here, this is not the street.": 1,
    "So I cannot street juggle here, you understand?": 1,
    "So you don't want me to street juggle here, right?": 1,
    "You know that, right?": 1,
    "You don't want me to juggle, right?": 1,
    " you": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " It's time I street juggle.": 1,
    " I use...": 1,
    " improvisation.": 1,
    " Now improvisation is empowering because it welcomes the unknown.": 1,
    "And since what's impossible is always unknown, it allows me": 1,
    " to believe I can cheat the impossible.": 1,
    " Now, I have done the impossible not once, but many times.": 1,
    "So, what should I share?": 1,
    "Oh, I know, Israel.": 1,
    "Some years ago,": 1,
    " I was invited to open the Israel Festival by a high wire walk, and I chose to put my wire between the Arab quarters and the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem over the Ben Hinnom Valley.": 1,
    " And I thought it would be incredible if in the middle of the wire I stop and I, like a magician, I produce, I make appear a dove and send her in the sky as a living symbol of peace.": 1,
    " Well now, I must say it was a little bit hard to find a dove in Israel, but I got one.": 1,
    " In my hotel room, each time I practice making it appear and then throwing her in the air, she will graze the wall and end up on the bed.": 1,
    " So I thought, no, it's OK.": 1,
    "I mean, the room is too small.": 1,
    "I mean, a bird needs space to fly.": 1,
    "It will go perfectly on the day of the walk.": 1,
    "Now comes the day of the walk.": 1,
    " 80,000 people spread over the entire valley.": 1,
    "The mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Collette, comes to wish me the best, but he's saying,": 1,
    " Nervous.": 1,
    "I mean there was tension in my wire, but I also could feel tension on the ground Because actually all those people were made of people who are for the most part considered each other enemies So I start the walk": 1,
    " Everything is fine.": 1,
    "I stop in the middle.": 1,
    "I make the dove appear.": 1,
    "People applaud and delight.": 1,
    " And then, in the most magnificent gesture, I send the bird of peace into the azure.": 1,
    "But the bird, instead of flying away, goes flop, flop, flop, and ends on my head.": 1,
    " And people scream.": 1,
    "So I grab the dove, and for the second time, I send her in the air.": 1,
    " But the dove who obviously didn't go to flying school does swoop swoop swoop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole.": 1,
    " So now, you laugh, you laugh, but hey, I sit down immediately.": 1,
    "It's a reflex of wire-walkers.": 1,
    "Now, in the meantime, the audience, they go crazy.": 1,
    "I mean, they must think this guy with his dove, he must spend years working, what a genius, what a professional.": 1,
    " So I take a bow, I salute with my hand and at the end I bang my hand against the pole to dislodge the bird.": 1,
    "Now the dove who, now you know obviously, cannot fly.": 1,
    " does for the third time and ends up on the wire behind me.": 1,
    "And the entire valley goes crazy.": 1,
    " But hold on, I'm not finished.": 1,
    "So now I'm like, what, 50 yards from my arrival and I'm exhausted so my steps are slow and something happened.": 1,
    " somebody somewhere, a group of people start clapping in rhythm with my steps.": 1,
    "And within seconds, the entire valley is applauding in unison with each of my steps, but not an applause of delight like before.": 1,
    " in applause of encouragement.": 1,
    "For a moment, the entire crowd had forgotten their differences.": 1,
    "They had become one, pushing me to triumph.": 1,
    " You know what, I want you just for a second to experience this amazing human symphony.": 1,
    "So let's say I am here and the chair is my arrival, okay?": 1,
    "So I walk, you clap, everybody in unison.": 1,
    " So after the walk, Teddy and I become friends, and he tells me he has on his desk a picture of me in the middle of the wire with a dove on my head.": 1,
    "I mean, he didn't know the true story.": 1,
    " And whenever he's downtrod by an impossible situation to solve in his hard-to-manage city, instead of giving up, he looks at the picture and he says, if Philip can do that, I can do this.": 1,
    "And he goes back to work.": 1,
    " Inspiration.": 1,
    " By inspiring ourselves, we inspire others.": 1,
    "I mean, I will never forget this music, and I hope now neither will you.": 1,
    " Please take this music with you home and start gluing feathers to your arms and take off and fly and look at the world from a different perspective.": 1,
    " And when you see mountains, remember mountains can be moved.": 1
