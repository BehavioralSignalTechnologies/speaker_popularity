    "OK.": 4,
    " When I was about three or four years old, I remember my mum reading a story to me and my two big brothers.": 1,
    " And I remember putting up my hands to feel the page of the book, to feel the picture they were discussing.": 1,
    " And my mum said, darling, remember that you can't see and you can't feel the picture and you can't feel the print on the page.": 1,
    "And I thought to myself,": 1,
    " That's what I want to do.": 1,
    "I love stories I want to read.": 1,
    " Little did I know that I would be part of a technological revolution that would make that dream come true.": 1,
    " I was born premature by about 10 weeks, which resulted in my blindness some 64 years ago.": 1,
    "The condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia, and it's now very rare in the developed world.": 1,
    " Little did I know, lying curled up in my prem-baby humidity crib in 1948, that I'd been born at the right place and the right time.": 1,
    " that I was in a country where I could participate in the technological revolution.": 1,
    "There are 37 million totally blind people on our planet.": 1,
    " But those of us who've shared in the technological changes mainly come from North America, Europe, Japan and other developed parts of the world.": 1,
    " Computers have changed the lives of us all in this room and around the world, but I think they've changed the lives of we blind people more than any other group.": 1,
    " And so I want to tell you about the interaction between computer-based adaptive technology and the many volunteers who helped me over the years to become the person I am today.": 1,
    " It's an interaction between volunteers, passionate inventors and technology.": 1,
    "And it's a story that many other blind people could tell.": 1,
    "But let me tell you a bit about it today.": 1,
    " When I was five, I went to school and I learned Braille.": 1,
    "It's an ingenious system of six dots that are punched into paper, and I can feel them with my fingers.": 1,
    " In fact, I think they're putting up my Grade 6 report.": 1,
    "I don't know where Julian Morrow got that from.": 1,
    " I was pretty good in reading, but religion and musical appreciation needed more work.": 1,
    " When you leave the opera house, you'll find there's Braille signage in the lifts.": 1,
    "Look for it.": 1,
    "Have you noticed it?": 1,
    " I do.": 1,
    "I look for it all the time.": 1,
    " When I was at school...": 1,
    " The books were transcribed by transcribers, voluntary people who punched one dot at a time so I'd have volumes to read.": 1,
    "And that had been going on mainly by women since the late 19th century in this country, but it was the only way I could read.": 1,
    " When I was in high school, I got my first Philips reel-to-reel tape recorder.": 1,
    "And tape recorders came my sort of pre-computer medium of learning.": 1,
    "I could have family and friends read me material.": 1,
    " and I could then read it back as many times as I needed.": 1,
    "And it brought me into contact with volunteers and helpers.": 1,
    " For example, when I studied at graduate school at Queen's University in Canada, the prisoners at the Collins Bay Jail agreed to help me.": 1,
    "I gave them a tape recorder and they read into it.": 1,
    "As one of them said to me,": 1,
    " Ron, we ain't going anywhere at the moment.": 1,
    " But think of it, these men who hadn't had the educational opportunities I'd had helped me gain postgraduate qualifications in law by their dedicated help.": 1,
    " I went back and became an academic at Melbourne's Monash University.": 1,
    " And for those 25 years, tape recorders were everything to me.": 1,
    "In fact, in my office in 1990, I had 18 miles of tape.": 1,
    " students, family, and friends all read me material.": 1,
    " Mrs. Lois Diary, whom I later came to call my surrogate mum, read me many thousands of hours on the tape.": 1,
    " One of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today was that I was hoping that Lois would be here so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her.": 1,
    " But sadly, her health hasn't permitted her to come today.": 1,
    "But I thank you here Lois, from this platform.": 1,
    " I saw my first Apple computer in 1984, and I thought to myself, this thing's got a glass screen not much use to me.": 1,
    " How very wrong I was.": 1,
    " In 1987, in the month our eldest son Jared was born, I got my first blind computer.": 1,
    "And it's actually here.": 1,
    " See it up there?": 1,
    " And you see it has no, what do you call it, no screen?": 1,
    " It's a blind computer.": 1,
    " It's a Keynote Gold 84K, and the 84K stands for it had 84 kilobytes of memory.": 1,
    " Don't laugh, it cost me $4,000 at the time.": 1,
    " I think there's more memory in my watch.": 1,
    " It was invented by Russell Smith, a passionate inventor in New Zealand who was trying to help blind people.": 1,
    "Sadly, he died in a light plane crash in 2005, but his memory lives on in my heart.": 1,
    " It meant for the first time I could read back what I had typed into it.": 1,
    "It had a speech synthesizer.": 1,
    "I'd written my first co-authored label or book on a typewriter in 1979 purely from memory.": 1,
    " This now allowed me to read back what I'd written and to enter the computer world, even with 84Ks of memory.": 1,
    " In 1974, the great Ray Kurzweil, the American inventor worked on building a machine that would scan books and read them out in synthetic speech.": 1,
    " Optical character recognition units then only operated usually on one fault.": 1,
    " But by using charged couple device flatbed scanners and speech synthesizers, he developed a machine that could read any font.": 1,
    " And his machine, which was as big as a washing machine, was launched on the 13th of January 1976.": 1,
    "I saw my first commercially available Kerswell in March 1989 and it blew me away.": 1,
    " And in September 1989, the month that my associate professorship at Monash University was announced, the law school got one and I could use it.": 1,
    " For the first time, I could read what I wanted to read by putting a book on the scanner.": 1,
    "I didn't have to be nice to people.": 1,
    " I no longer would be censored.": 1,
    "For example, I was too shy then, and I'm actually too shy now, to ask anybody to read me out loud sexually explicit material.": 1,
    " But you know, I could pop a book on in the middle of the night and...": 1,
    " Now the cursor reader is simply a program on my laptop.": 1,
    "That's what it shrunk to.": 1,
    "And now I can scan the latest novel and not wait to get it into talking book libraries.": 1,
    "I can keep up with my friends.": 1,
    " There are many people who've helped me in my life and many that I haven't met.": 1,
    "One is another American inventor, Ted Hentner.": 1,
    " Ted was a motorcycle racer, but in 1978 he had a car accident and lost his sight.": 1,
    "Just devastating if you're trying to ride motorbikes.": 1,
    " He then turned to being a water skier and was a champion disabled water skier.": 1,
    "But in 1989, he teamed up with Bill Joyce to develop a program": 1,
    " that would read out what was on the computer screen from the net or from what was on the computer.": 1,
    "It's called JAWS, Job Access with Speech, and it sounds like this.": 1,
    " Isn't that slow?": 1,
    " You see, if I read like that, I'd fall asleep.": 1,
    "I slowed it down for you.": 1,
    "I'm going to ask that we play it at the speed I read it.": 1,
    "Can we play that one?": 1,
    " You know, when you're marking student essays, you want to get through them fairly quickly.": 1,
    " This technology that fascinated me in 1987 is now on my iPhone and on yours as well.": 1,
    "But you know, I find reading with machines a very lonely process.": 1,
    " I grew up with family, friends reading to me and I love the warmth and the breath and the closeness of people reading to me.": 1,
    "Do you love being read to?": 1,
    " And one of my most endearing memories is in 1999, Mary reading to me and the children down near Manly Beach, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.": 1,
    "Isn't that a great book?": 1,
    " still love being close to someone reading to me.": 1,
    "But I wouldn't give up the technology because it's allowed me to lead a great life.": 1,
    " Of course, talking books for the blind predated all this technology.": 1,
    "After all, the long playing record": 1,
    " was developed in the early 1930s and now we put talking books on CDs using the digital access system known as DAISY.": 1,
    " But when I'm reading with synthetic voices, I love to come home and read a racy novel with a real voice.": 1,
    " Now, there are still barriers in front of we people with disabilities.": 1,
    "Many websites we can't read using JAWS and the other technologies.": 1,
    "Websites are often very visual and there are all these sorts of graphs that aren't labelled and buttons that aren't labelled.": 1,
    " And that's why the World Wide Web Consortium 3, known as W3C, has developed worldwide standards": 1,
    " for the internet.": 1,
    "And we want all internet users or internet site owners to make their sites compatible so that we persons without vision can have a level playing field.": 1,
    " There are other barriers brought about by our laws.": 1,
    "For example, Australia, like about one third of the world's countries, has copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailed or read for wee blind persons.": 1,
    " But those books can't travel across borders.": 1,
    " For example, in Spain, there are 100,000 accessible books in Spanish.": 1,
    "In Argentina, there are 50,000.": 1,
    "In no other Latin American country are there more than a couple of thousand.": 1,
    "But it's not legal to transport the books from Spain to Latin America.": 1,
    " There are hundreds of thousands of accessible books in the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, etc.": 1,
    "But they can't be transported to the 60 countries in our world where English is the first and the second language.": 1,
    "And remember I was telling you about Harry Potter?": 1,
    " Well, because we can't transport books across borders, there have to be separate versions read in all the different English-speaking countries.": 1,
    " Britain, United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand all had to have separate readings of Harry Potter.": 1,
    " And that's why next month in Morocco, a meeting is taking place between all the countries.": 1,
    "It's something that a group of countries and the World Blind Union are advocating, a cross-border treaty.": 1,
    " so that if books are available under a copyright exception and the other country has a copyright exception, we can transport those books across borders and give life to people, particularly in developing countries, blind people who don't have the books to read.": 1,
    " I want that to happen.": 1,
    " My life has been extraordinarily blessed with marriage and children and certainly interesting work to do.": 1,
    " Whether it be at the University of Sydney Law School where I served a term as Dean or now as I sit on the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Geneva, I've indeed been a very fortunate human being.": 1,
    " I wonder what the future will hold.": 1,
    "The technology will advance even further.": 1,
    " But I can still remember my mum saying 60 years ago, remember darling, you'll never be able to read the print with your fingers.": 1,
    " I'm so glad that the interaction between Braille transcribers, volunteer readers and passionate inventors has allowed this dream of reading to come true for me and for blind people throughout the world.": 1,
    " I'd like to thank my researcher, Hannah Martin, who is my slide clicker and clicks the slides.": 1,
    " My wife, Professor Mary Croc, who's the light of my life, is coming on to collect me.": 1,
    "I want to thank her too.": 1,
    "I think I have to say goodbye now.": 1,
    "Bless you.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " Whoa!": 1,
    "Yay!": 1,
    " OK.": 1
