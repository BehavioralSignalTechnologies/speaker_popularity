    " What is love?": 1,
    " It's a difficult term to define as its application is very broad.": 1,
    " I can like football.": 1,
    "I can like a book, a movie.": 1,
    "I can like an escalope.": 1,
    " Je peux aimer ma femme.": 1,
    " But there is a big difference between an escalope and my wife, for example.": 1,
    " is that if I value the escalope, the escalope in return does not value me.": 1,
    " while my wife calls me the star of her life.": 1,
    " Only another desired conscience can make me a desirable being.": 1,
    "I know that, and that's why we can define love in a more precise way as the desire to be desired.": 1,
    " d'o\u00f9 l'\u00e9ternel probl\u00e8me de l'amour, comment devenir et comment rester d\u00e9sirable.": 1,
    " So?": 1,
    " The answer to this problem, the individual found it other time by submitting his life to the rules of the community.": 1,
    " Il avait un r\u00f4le pr\u00e9cis \u00e0 tenir suivant son sexe, son \u00e2ge, son statut social.": 1,
    "Il suffisait qu'il le tienne pour \u00eatre valoris\u00e9 et aim\u00e9.": 1,
    " by its entire community.": 1,
    "Think of the young girl who has to stay chaste before the wedding, think of the chaste son who has to obey the eldest son, who himself has to obey the patriarch.": 1,
    " seulement, voil\u00e0.": 1,
    " A phenomenon began in the 13th century, but especially in the Renaissance, in the West, which caused the greatest crisis of identity in the history of humanity.": 1,
    " This phenomenon is modernity.": 1,
    "We can basically summarize it by a triple process.": 1,
    "First, a process of rationalization of scientific research, which accelerated technical progress.": 1,
    " Then, a process of political democratization, which has developed the rights of the individual.": 1,
    "And finally,": 1,
    " a process of rationalization of economic production and liberalization of trade.": 1,
    "These three processes intertwined": 1,
    " have completely destroyed all the traditional landmarks of Western societies.": 1,
    "The consequence for the individual is radical.": 1,
    "The individual is now free to value": 1,
    " or to devalue this attitude, this choice, this object.": 1,
    " But then...": 1,
    " sa personne elle-m\u00eame.": 1,
    " and face the same freedom as others to value it or to devalue it.": 1,
    " To put it another way, my value, once, I assured it by submitting myself to the traditional authorities.": 1,
    " Maintenant, les c\u00f4t\u00e9s en bourse.": 1,
    " on the free market of individual desires, I negotiate my value every day.": 1,
    " D'o\u00f9 l'angoisse de l'homme contemporain, son obsession.": 1,
    "Suis-je d\u00e9sirable ?": 1,
    "\u00c0 quel point ?": 1,
    "Combien de gens vont m'aimer ?": 1,
    " And how do they respond to this anxiety?": 1,
    "By hysterically accumulating the symbols of desirability.": 1,
    " I call this accumulation, with others, the seduction capital.": 1,
    " It is on the seduction capital that most of our consumer society rests.": 1,
    " On dit \u00e0 ce propos, \u00e0 propos de la consommation, que notre \u00e9poque est mat\u00e9rialiste.": 1,
    "Mais c'est faux !": 1,
    " If we accumulate objects, it's to communicate with other minds, it's to make us love them, to seduce them.": 1,
    " Nothing less materialistic, nothing more sentimental than a teenager who buys a pair of brand new jeans, who tears it apart on his knees,": 1,
    " Because he wants to please Jennifer.": 1,
    " Consumerism is not materialism.": 1,
    "It is rather the engulfed, sacrificed matter in the name of the God of Love, or rather in the name of capital seduction.": 1,
    " So, from this observation on current love, how do you think about the love of the future?": 1,
    " We can consider two hypotheses.": 1,
    "The first is to bet on an accentuation of this narcissistic capitalization process.": 1,
    " What form will this accentuation take?": 1,
    "It's very hard to say.": 1,
    "Because it depends largely on social and technical innovations, which are by definition difficult to predict.": 1,
    " But we can, for example, imagine a meeting site.": 1,
    " or a bit like with SMILE points, we work with seduction capital points, which vary according to my age, my ratio of size and weight, my diploma, my salary.": 1,
    " or the number of clicks accumulated on my profile.": 1,
    " We can also imagine a chemical treatment of love rupture.": 1,
    " which weakens attachment.": 1,
    " There is already a show on MTV, where seduction teachers": 1,
    " treat love grief as a disease.": 1,
    " These professors are called pick-up artists.": 1,
    " So artist in French, it's easy, it's artist.": 1,
    "And then pick-up, it's lifting, but not any kind of lifting, lifting of girls.": 1,
    "So these are artists lifting girls.": 1,
    " And they call love grief one itis.": 1,
    "Itis, in English, is a suffix that means infection.": 1,
    "So one itis, we could translate it as infection of the one.": 1,
    "It's a bit disgusting.": 1,
    " And in fact, for the pick-up artists, to make a romantic fixation on someone": 1,
    " Well, it's wasting your time, it's dilapidating your seduction capital, and so we have to eliminate that as a disease, as an infection.": 1,
    " We can still consider a love letter from the genomic map.": 1,
    "We would each bring it to ourselves, and then we would show it to each other as a business card.": 1,
    " to check if the seduction can't lead to reproduction.": 1,
    " Alors bien s\u00fbr...": 1,
    " This race to seduction, like any fierce competition, will produce great disparities of narcissistic satisfaction and therefore also a lot of loneliness, a lot of frustration.": 1,
    " So we have to expect that modernity itself, which is at the origin of the seduction capital...": 1,
    " I think in particular of neo-fascist or religious communitarian reactions.": 1,
    " Mais bon.": 1,
    " A future like this is not fatal.": 1,
    " Another way can be possible to think about love.": 1,
    " But how?": 1,
    "How to give up the hysterical demand to be valued?": 1,
    " Eh bien.": 1,
    " by becoming aware of my nullity.": 1,
    " Eh oui, je suis nul.": 1,
    " But rest assured, you too.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " We are...": 1,
    " Nous sommes tous nuls.": 1,
    " It's quite easy to demonstrate this nullity, because to be valued...": 1,
    " Je demande \u00e0 l'autre qu'il me d\u00e9sire.": 1,
    "Donc c'est que je n'ai pas de valeur en moi-m\u00eame, je n'ai pas de valeur en soi.": 1,
    " Nous faignons tous d'avoir une idole, nous faignons tous d'\u00eatre une idole pour quelqu'un, mais en fait nous sommes tous des imposteurs, un peu comme celui qui passe en seigneur indiff\u00e9rent dans la rue.": 1,
    " while he has planned everything, calculated everything, so that all eyes are on him.": 1,
    " So I think that being aware of this general imposture, which concerns us all, will pacify our love affairs.": 1,
    "It's because I want to be adored to the end of my nails, justified in all my choices, that there is a hysteria of seduction.": 1,
    " et du coup je veux para\u00eetre parfait pour que l'autre m'aime je veux qu'il soit parfait pour qu'il me rassure sur ma valeur et cela donne des couples": 1,
    " obsessed by performance and who will leave themselves at the slightest counter-performance.": 1,
    "So, in contrast to this attitude,": 1,
    " J'invoque la tendresse.": 1,
    "L'amour en tant que tendresse.": 1,
    "Qu'est-ce que la tendresse?": 1,
    "C'est... \u00catre tendre, c'est accepter les faiblesses de l'\u00eatre aim\u00e9.": 1,
    "Oh, il s'agit pas de se transformer en un triste couple d'aides-soignants, hein.": 1,
    "C'est pas terrible, \u00e7a.": 1,
    " On the contrary, there is a lot of charm, a lot of joy in tenderness.": 1,
    "I think in particular of a type of humor that is rarely practiced, and which is a kind of poetry of the disease assumed, I think of self-derision.": 1,
    " For a couple that is no longer maintained, supported by the constraints of tradition, I think self-dissolution is one of the best ways to last.": 1
