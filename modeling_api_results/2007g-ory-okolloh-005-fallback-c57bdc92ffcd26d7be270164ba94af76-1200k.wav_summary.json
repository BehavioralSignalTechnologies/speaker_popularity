    "He got sick again.": 2,
    " So what's image got to do with it?": 1,
    "And I must say, I think America is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages because I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues.": 1,
    " that have come up, but I'm going to try and do something different and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we've been talking about.": 1,
    " So Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions, as you can see.": 1,
    "We're not the only ones.": 1,
    " And it's amazing.": 1,
    "I mean, we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent.": 1,
    "Just think about that.": 1,
    " And this is typically what we've been talking about, the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff.": 1,
    "Now, why is that a problem?": 1,
    " Typical disaster story disease, corruption, poverty.": 1,
    " And some of you might be standing here thinking, saying, okay, you know, Ori, you're Harvard educated and all you privileged people come here saying, forget the poor people, let's focus on business and the markets and whatever.": 1,
    " And there are all these 80% of Africans who really need help.": 1,
    "And I want to tell you that this is my story, okay?": 1,
    "And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here.": 1,
    " Start with poverty.": 1,
    "I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire, but I know what it is to grow up without having money or being able to support family.": 1,
    " Yuvin was talking about bellwether signs.": 1,
    "The bellwether for whether a family was broke or not was breakfast.": 1,
    "You know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages.": 1,
    "When things were bad, we had porridge.": 1,
    " And like many African families, my parents could never save because they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents.": 1,
    "And things were always dicey.": 1,
    " Now, when I was born, they realized they had a pretty smart kid, and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school, which was free.": 1,
    "And they adopted a very interesting education, approach to education, which shows they're going to take me to a school that they can barely afford.": 1,
    " So they took me to a private Catholic elementary school, which set the foundation for what ended up being my career.": 1,
    " What happened was because they could afford it, sometimes sometimes not.": 1,
    "I got kicked out pretty much every term.": 1,
    " that someone would come in with a list of the people who haven't paid school fees, and when they started getting pretty strict, you had to leave until your school fees could be paid.": 1,
    " And I remember thinking, I mean, why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school?": 1,
    "Because, you know, as a kid, you know, you're embarrassed and you're, you know, you're sensitive and everyone knows you guys don't have money, but they kept at it and, you know.": 1,
    " And I now understand why they did what they did.": 1,
    " You talk about corruption.": 1,
    "In Kenya we have an entrance exam going to high school and there's national schools which are like the best schools and provincial schools.": 1,
    " My dream school at that time was Kenya High School National School.": 1,
    "I missed the cutoff by one point and I was so disappointed and I was like, oh my God, what am I going to do?": 1,
    " My father said, OK, listen, let's go and try and talk to the headmistress.": 1,
    "And it's just one point.": 1,
    "I mean, maybe she'll let you in if there's lots still there.": 1,
    "So we went to the school.": 1,
    "And because we were nobodies,": 1,
    " And because we didn't have privilege and because my father didn't have the right last name, he was treated like dirt.": 1,
    "And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him saying, you know, who do you think you are?": 1,
    " You must be joking if you think you can get a slot.": 1,
    "And I had gone to school with other girls who were kids of politicians and who had done much, much worse than I did.": 1,
    "And they had slots there.": 1,
    " And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you, you know?": 1,
    "And we left and I swore to myself, and I was like, I'm never ever going to have to beg for anything in my life.": 1,
    " They called me two weeks later, they're like, oh, yeah, you can come now.": 1,
    "And I told them to stop it.": 1,
    " A final story, and sort of have to speak quickly, disease.": 1,
    "My father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999.": 1,
    " He never told anyone that he had AIDS.": 1,
    "His fear of the stigma was so strong.": 1,
    "And I'm pretty much the one who figured it out because": 1,
    " That was a nerd.": 1,
    "And I was in the States at the time, and they called me.": 1,
    "He was very sick the first time he got sick.": 1,
    "And he had cryptococcal meningitis.": 1,
    " And so I went on to Google cryptococcal meningitis, you know, because the doctors, because of doctor patient privilege, they couldn't really tell us what was going on.": 1,
    "But they're like, you know, this is a long term thing.": 1,
    "And when I went online and looked at the infectious": 1,
    " you know, read about the disease, I pretty much realized what was going on.": 1,
    "The first time he got sick, he recovered.": 1,
    "But what happened was that he had to be on medication that at that time, deflecan, which in the States is used for yeast infections, uh, cost $30.": 1,
    " He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life.": 1,
    " You know, so money ran out.": 1,
    "And up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India and he used to import generic, bring in generic, could get him generic version of it.": 1,
    " And that kept him going.": 1,
    "But the money ran out.": 1,
    " He got sick on a Friday.": 1,
    "At that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya.": 1,
    "And we could not get cash.": 1,
    "The family couldn't get cash for him to start the treatment.": 1,
    " until Monday.": 1,
    "The hospital put him on a water drip for three days.": 1,
    " And finally, we figured we were like, OK, we better just try and take him to a public hospital.": 1,
    "At least he'll get treated.": 1,
    "We'll try to figure out the money situation.": 1,
    "And he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him.": 1,
    " And you know, now imagine if, when I could go on and on, imagine if this is all you knew about me.": 1,
    "How would you look at me?": 1,
    " with pity, you know?": 1,
    " And this is how you look at Africa.": 1,
    "This is the damage it causes.": 1,
    "You don't see the other side of me.": 1,
    "You don't see the blogger.": 1,
    "You don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer, the vibrant person, you know?": 1,
    " And I just wanted to personalize that because we talk about it in big terms and you wonder, you know, so what?": 1,
    "But it's damaging.": 1,
    " And I'm not unique, right?": 1,
    "Imagine if all you knew about William was the fact that he grew up in a poor village and you didn't know about the windmill, you know?": 1,
    "And I was just moved.": 1,
    "I was actually crying during his presentation.": 1,
    "He was like,": 1,
    " I try and I make.": 1,
    "I was like, Nike should hire, you know, just do it.": 1,
    "And this is again the point I'm trying to make, when you focus just on the disasters.": 1,
    " Bye!": 1,
    " We're ignoring the potential.": 1,
    " So what is to be done?": 1,
    "First of all, Africans, we need to get better at telling our stories.": 1,
    "We had about that yesterday.": 1,
    "We had some, you know, this morning.": 1,
    " And this is an example of, you know, blogging is when we were doing that.": 1,
    "Afrigator is an aggregate of African blogs that was developed in South Africa.": 1,
    "So we need to start getting better.": 1,
    "If no one else would tell our stories, let's do it.": 1,
    " And going back to the point I was trying to make, this is the Swahili Wikipedia.": 1,
    "Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa.": 1,
    "It only has five contributors.": 1,
    " Four of them are white males, non-native speakers.": 1,
    "The other person is Desandra, if you're here, stand up.": 1,
    " is the Tanzanian first Wahili blogger.": 1,
    "He's the only African who is contributing to this.": 1,
    "People, please, we can't whine and complain the West is doing this.": 1,
    "What are we doing?": 1,
    " Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers?": 1,
    "Why are we not generating our own content?": 1,
    "It's not enough to complain, we need to act.": 1,
    " Reuters now integrates African blogs into their coverage of Africa.": 1,
    "So that's a start, and we've heard of all the other initiatives.": 1,
    " a cheater generation.": 1,
    "The aid approach, you know, is flawed, you know, and up to all the hoopla of live aids, we're still not anywhere in the picture.": 1,
    " No, you're not.": 1,
    " Oh.": 1,
    " But the point I'm trying to make though is that it's not enough for us to criticize.": 1,
    "And for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should I be, what, you know, should I move back, should I stay, you know, just jump.": 1,
    " the continent needs you.": 1,
    "And I can't emphasize that enough.": 1,
    "You know, I walked away from a job with": 1,
    " One of the top firms in D.C., Coventry & Breling, six figures.": 1,
    "With two paychecks or three paychecks, I could solve a lot of my family's problems.": 1,
    "But I walked away from that because my passion was here.": 1,
    " and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling and because I'm needed here, you know.": 1,
    " probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a Harvard Law School degree because of all the things I'm doing.": 1,
    "And one is because I'm pretty aggressive and I try and find opportunities.": 1,
    " But there's such a need, you know.": 1,
    "I'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called Enablist that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa.": 1,
    "We're now moving into East Africa.": 1,
    " and we give them business development services as well as financing loan equity.": 1,
    " also started a project in Kenya, and what we do is we track the performance of Kenyan MPs.": 1,
    "My partner, who is like a tech guru, hacked WordPress.": 1,
    "It cost us like 20 bucks a month just for hosting.": 1,
    "Everything else on there is": 1,
    " a labor of love.": 1,
    "We've like manually entered all the data there and you can get profiles of each MP questions have asked in parliament.": 1,
    "We have a comment function that where people can ask the MPs questions.": 1,
    "There's some MPs who participate and come back and ask": 1,
    " And basically we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians.": 1,
    "I believe that accountability stems from demand.": 1,
    " You're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart.": 1,
    "And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders.": 1,
    "What are they doing?": 1,
    "You know, they're not going to change.": 1,
    " out of nowhere, say we need new policies, where is that coming from?": 1,
    "And the other thing is that these leaders, they are a reflection of our society.": 1,
    "We talk about African governments like they've been dropped from Mars.": 1,
    " You know, they come from us.": 1,
    "And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like?": 1,
    "And how can we change that?": 1,
    " one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable.": 1,
    " Where do we go from here?": 1,
    "I believe in the power of ideas.": 1,
    "I believe in the power of sharing knowledge.": 1,
    "And I'd ask all of you, when you leave here,": 1,
    " Please just share and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going because it can make a difference.": 1,
    " other thing I want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual.": 1,
    "I've had lots of conversations about things that think": 1,
    " need to be happening in Africa.": 1,
    "People are like, OK, if we don't do aid, I'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?": 1,
    "And when I talk about my ideas, they're like, but it's not scalable.": 1,
    "Give me something I can do with PayPal.": 1,
    " It's not that easy, you know.": 1,
    "And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual and the fellows you've met and the business people you've met": 1,
    " it can make a huge difference, especially in Africa because usually the individual in Africa carries a lot of people behind them.": 1,
    " I mean, when I was a first year student in law school, my mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her.": 1,
    "My sister's struggling to get through undergrad.": 1,
    "I was helping her pay her tuition.": 1,
    " My cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart.": 1,
    "I was paying her school fees.": 1,
    "Cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan.": 1,
    "So I said, well, what are we going to do with her?": 1,
    "You know, she's now my baby sister.": 1,
    " And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me, I'm able to lift all those people.": 1,
    "So don't underestimate that.": 1,
    " An example, this man changed my life.": 1,
    "He's a professor.": 1,
    "He's now at Vanderbilt.": 1,
    "He was an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson.": 1,
    "And because of him, I got into Harvard Law School.": 1,
    "And because he took an interest, I was taking a class with him.": 1,
    " And he was like, this is an overt student, which we don't normally get in the United States because everyone else is cynical and jaded.": 1,
    "And he called me to his office and said, what do you want to do when you grow up?": 1,
    "I said, I want to be a lawyer.": 1,
    "And he's like, why?": 1,
    " You know, we don't need another lawyer in the United States.": 1,
    "And he tried to talk me out of it.": 1,
    "He's like, OK, look, I know nothing about applying to law school and policy PhD.": 1,
    " But, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do, you know, what I need to do to help you out.": 1,
    "It's like, where do you want to go?": 1,
    "And to me at that time in university, I was in University of Pittsburgh for undergrad, and that was like heaven, okay, because compared to where I could have been in Kenya.": 1,
    " So I'm like, yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school.": 1,
    "He's like, why?": 1,
    "You know, you're smart.": 1,
    "I mean, you have all these things going for you.": 1,
    "And I'm like, because I'm here, and it's cheap, and you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh.": 1,
    "Like, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard, applying to law school.": 1,
    " And, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me, and he said, look, you can get into Harvard.": 1,
    "You're that good, okay?": 1,
    "And if they don't admit you,": 1,
    " they're the ones who are messed up.": 1,
    "And he built me up, you know.": 1,
    "And it's just an illustration.": 1,
    "You can meet other individuals here who just need a push.": 1,
    "That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level.": 1,
    " Basically, I want to end with my vision for Africa.": 1,
    "The gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave.": 1,
    " the continent so that we can fulfill our potential.": 1,
    "My vision is that my daughter and any other African child being born today can be whoever they want to be here.": 1,
    " without having to leave and they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born.": 1,
    "That's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know, that you can": 1,
    " grow up, you know, not so good circumstances and you can move.": 1,
    "You can, you know, just because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever, that doesn't define who you are.": 1,
    "For most Africans,": 1,
    " today where you live pretty much where you were born and the circumstances under which you were born determine the rest of your life.": 1,
    "I would like to see that change and the change starts with us.": 1,
    " and as Africans we need to take responsibility for our continent.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
