    " When I was young, I prided myself as a nonconformist in the conservative US state I live in, Kansas.": 1,
    " I didn't follow along with the crowd.": 1,
    "I wasn't afraid to try weird clothing trends or hairstyles.": 1,
    "I was outspoken and extremely social.": 1,
    " Even these pictures and postcards of my London semester abroad 16 years ago show that I obviously didn't care if I was perceived as weird or different.": 1,
    " But that same year I was in London 16 years ago, I realized something about myself that actually was somewhat unique.": 1,
    " And that changed everything.": 1,
    " I became the opposite of who I thought I once was.": 1,
    "I stayed in my room instead of socializing.": 1,
    "I stopped engaging in clubs and leadership activities.": 1,
    "I didn't want to stand out in the crowd anymore.": 1,
    " I told myself it was because I was growing up and maturing, not that I was suddenly looking for acceptance.": 1,
    "I'd always assumed I was immune to needing acceptance.": 1,
    "After all, I was a bit unconventional.": 1,
    " But I realize now that the moment I realized something was different about me was the exact same moment that I began conforming and hiding.": 1,
    " Hiding is a progressive habit.": 1,
    "And once you start hiding, it becomes harder and harder to step forward and speak out.": 1,
    " In fact, even now, when I was talking to people about what this talk was about, I made up a cover story, and I even hid the truth about my TED talk.": 1,
    " So it is fitting and scary that I have returned to this city 16 years later and I have chosen this stage": 1,
    " to finally stop hiding.": 1,
    " What have I been hiding for 16 years?": 1,
    " I am a lesbian.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " I've struggled to say those words because I didn't want to be defined by them.": 1,
    "Every time I would think about coming out in the past, I would think to myself, but I just want to be known as Morgana.": 1,
    " uniquely Morgana, but not my lesbian friend Morgana, or my gay coworker Morgana, just Morgana.": 1,
    " For those of you from large metropolitan areas, this may not seem like a big deal to you.": 1,
    "It may seem strange that I've suppressed the truth and hidden this for so long.": 1,
    " But I was paralyzed by my fear of not being accepted.": 1,
    " And I'm not alone, of course.": 1,
    "A 2013 Deloitte study found that a surprisingly large number of people hide aspects of their identity.": 1,
    " Of all the employees they surveyed, 61% reported changing an aspect of their behavior or their appearance in order to fit in at work.": 1,
    " of all the gay, lesbian, and bisexual employees, 83% admitted to changing some aspects of themselves so they would not appear at work too gay.": 1,
    " The study found that even in companies with diversity policies and inclusion programs, employees struggle to be themselves at work because they believe conformity is critical to their long-term career advancement.": 1,
    " And while I was surprised that so many people, just like me, waste so much energy trying to hide themselves,": 1,
    " I was scared when I discovered that my silence has life or death consequences and long-term social repercussions.": 1,
    " 12 years.": 1,
    " the length by which life expectancy is shortened for gay, lesbian, and bisexual people in highly anti-gay communities compared to accepting communities.": 1,
    " 12 years reduced life expectancy.": 1,
    "When I read that in the Advocate magazine this year, I realized I could no longer afford to keep silent.": 1,
    " The effects of personal stress and social stigmas are a deadly combination.": 1,
    " The study found that gays and anti-gay communities had higher rates of heart disease, violence, and suicide.": 1,
    " What I once thought was simply a personal matter, I realized had a ripple effect that went into the workplace and out into the community for every story just like mine.": 1,
    " My choice to hide and not share who I really am may have inadvertently contributed to this exact same environment and atmosphere of discrimination.": 1,
    " I'd always told myself there's no reason to share that I was gay.": 1,
    "But the idea that my silence has social consequences was really driven home this year when I missed an opportunity": 1,
    " to change the atmosphere of discrimination in my own home state of Kansas.": 1,
    " In February, the Kansas House of Representatives brought up a bill for vote that would have essentially allowed businesses to use religious freedom as a reason to deny gays services.": 1,
    " A former co-worker and friend of mine has a father that serves in the Kansas House of Representatives.": 1,
    " He voted in favor of the bill.": 1,
    " in favor of a law that would allow businesses to not serve me.": 1,
    " How does my friend feel about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioned people?": 1,
    "How does her father feel?": 1,
    " I don't know, because I was never honest with them about who I am.": 1,
    "And that shakes me to the core.": 1,
    " What if I had told her my story years ago?": 1,
    "Could she have told her father my experience?": 1,
    "Could I have ultimately helped change his vote?": 1,
    " I will never know.": 1,
    "And that made me realize I had done nothing to try and make a difference.": 1,
    " How ironic that I work in human resources, a profession that works to welcome, connect, and encourage the development of employees.": 1,
    " A profession that advocates that the diversity of society should be reflected in the workplace.": 1,
    "And yet, I have done nothing to advocate for diversity.": 1,
    " When I came to this company one year ago, I thought to myself, this company has anti-discrimination policies that protect gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people.": 1,
    " Their commitment to diversity is evident through their global inclusion programs.": 1,
    "When I walk through the doors of this company, I will finally come out.": 1,
    " But I didn't.": 1,
    " Instead of taking advantage of the opportunity, I did nothing.": 1,
    " When I was looking through my London journal and scrapbook from my London semester abroad 16 years ago, I came across this modified quote from Toni Morrison's book Paradise.": 1,
    " There are more scary things inside than outside.": 1,
    "And then I wrote a note to myself at the bottom.": 1,
    "Remember this.": 1,
    " I'm sure I was trying to encourage myself to get out and explore London.": 1,
    "But the message I missed was the need to start exploring and embracing myself.": 1,
    " What I didn't realize until all these years later is that the biggest obstacles I will ever have to overcome are my own fears and insecurities.": 1,
    " I believe that by facing my fears inside, I will be able to change reality outside.": 1,
    " I made a choice today to reveal a part of myself that I've hidden for too long.": 1,
    " I hope that this means I will never hide again.": 1,
    "And I hope that by coming out today, I can do something to change the data,": 1,
    " and also to help others who feel different be more themselves and more fulfilled in both their professional and personal lives.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
