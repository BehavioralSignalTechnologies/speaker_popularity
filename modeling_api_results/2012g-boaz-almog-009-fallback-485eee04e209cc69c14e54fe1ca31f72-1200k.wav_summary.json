    "Why?": 3,
    " The phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment is called quantum levitation and quantum locking.": 1,
    " And the object that was levitating here is called a superconductor.": 1,
    " Superconnectivity is a quantum state of the matter, and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature.": 1,
    "Now, it's quite an old phenomenon.": 1,
    "It was discovered 100 years ago.": 1,
    " However, only recently due to several technological advancements, we are now able to demonstrate to you quantum levitation and quantum locking.": 1,
    " So a superconductor is defined by two properties.": 1,
    "The first is zero electrical resistance, and the second is the expulsion of magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor.": 1,
    " That sounds complicated, right?": 1,
    "But what is electrical resistance?": 1,
    "So, electricity is the flow of electrons inside the material.": 1,
    " And these electrons, while flowing, they collide with the atoms.": 1,
    "And in this collision, they lose a certain amount of energy.": 1,
    "And they dissipate this energy in the form of heat.": 1,
    "And you know that fact.": 1,
    " However, inside the superconductor, there are no collisions.": 1,
    "So there is no energy dissipation.": 1,
    " It's quite remarkable.": 1,
    "Think about it.": 1,
    " In classical physics, there is always some friction, some energy loss, but not here, because it is a quantum effect.": 1,
    " But that's not all, because superconductors don't like magnetic fields.": 1,
    " So a superconductor will try to expel magnetic fields from the inside.": 1,
    "And it has the means to do that by circulating currents.": 1,
    " Now, the combination of both effects, the expulsion of magnetic field and zero electrical resistance is exactly a superconductor.": 1,
    " But the picture isn't always perfect, as we all know, and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor.": 1,
    " Now, under proper conditions, which we have here, these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor.": 1,
    " And this trend of magnetic field inside the superconductor, they come in discrete quantities.": 1,
    "Because it is a quantum phenomena, it's quantum physics.": 1,
    " And it turns out that they behave like quantum particles.": 1,
    "In this movie here, you can see how they flow one by one, discretely.": 1,
    "These are strands of magnetic field.": 1,
    "These are not particles, but they behave like particles.": 1,
    " So this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking.": 1,
    "But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field?": 1,
    " First there are strands of magnetic field left inside, but now the superconductor doesn't like them moving around because their movement dissipates energy, which breaks the superconductivity state.": 1,
    " So what it actually does, it locks these strands, which are called fluxons, and it locks these fluxons in place.": 1,
    "And by doing that, what it actually does": 1,
    " is locking itself in place.": 1,
    "Because any movement": 1,
    " of the superconductor will change their place, will change their configuration.": 1,
    "So we get quantum locking.": 1,
    "And let me show you": 1,
    " how this works.": 1,
    "I have here a superconductor which I wrapped up so it stays cold long enough.": 1,
    "And when I place it on top of a regular magnet,": 1,
    " It just stays locked in midair.": 1,
    " Now, this is not just levitation, it's not just repulsion.": 1,
    "I can rearrange the flux zones and it will be locked in this new configuration.": 1,
    "Like this, or move it slightly to the right or to the left.": 1,
    " So this is quantum locking, actually three-dimensional locking of the superconductor.": 1,
    "Now, of course, I can turn it upside down.": 1,
    " and it will remain locked.": 1,
    " Now that we understand that this levitation, so-called levitation, is actually locking": 1,
    " Yeah, we understand that.": 1,
    " You won't be surprised to hear that if I take this circular magnet": 1,
    " in which the magnetic field is the same all around, the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet.": 1,
    "Because as long as it rotates,": 1,
    " The locking is maintained.": 1,
    "You see?": 1,
    "I can adjust and I can rotate the superconductor.": 1,
    "We have frictionless motion.": 1,
    "It is still levitating.": 1,
    " but can move freely all around.": 1,
    " So we have quantum locking.": 1,
    " we can levitate it on top of this magnet.": 1,
    "But how many fluxons, how many magnetic strands are there in a single disk like this?": 1,
    "Well, we can calculate it, and it turns out quite a lot.": 1,
    "100 billion strands": 1,
    " of magnetic field inside this three-inch disk.": 1,
    "But that's not the amazing part yet, because there is something I haven't told you yet.": 1,
    " And the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here is only half a micron thick.": 1,
    "It's extremely thin.": 1,
    " And this extremely thin layer is able to levitate more than 70,000 times its own weight.": 1,
    "It's a remarkable effect.": 1,
    "It's very strong.": 1,
    " Now, I can extend this circular magnet and make whatever track I want.": 1,
    " For example, I can make a large circular rail here.": 1,
    " And": 1,
    " When I place the superconducting disk on top of this rail,": 1,
    " It moves freely.": 1,
    " And again, that's not all.": 1,
    "I can adjust its position like this and rotate.": 1,
    " freely moves in this new position.": 1,
    " And I can try, I can even try a new thing.": 1,
    "Let's try it for the first time.": 1,
    "I can take this disk and put it here.": 1,
    " And while it stays here, don't move, I will try to rotate the track.": 1,
    " And hopefully, if I did it correctly, it stays suspended.": 1,
    " You see, it's quantum locking, not levitation.": 1,
    " Now, while I let it circulate for a little more,": 1,
    " Let me tell you a little bit about superconductors.": 1,
    " So we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors.": 1,
    "So we can use them to produce": 1,
    " strong magnetic fields, such as needed in MRI machines, particle accelerators, and so on.": 1,
    "But we can also store energy using superconductors because we have no dissipation.": 1,
    " And we could also produce power cables to transfer enormous amount of current between power station.": 1,
    "Imagine you could back up.": 1,
    " a single power station with a single superconducting cable.": 1,
    " But what is the future of quantum levitation and quantum locking?": 1,
    "Well, let me answer this simple question by giving you an example.": 1,
    " Imagine you would have": 1,
    " A disk similar to the one I have here in my hand, three inch diameter, with a single difference, the superconducting layer.": 1,
    " Instead of being half a micron thin, being two millimeters thin, quite thin, this two millimeter thin superconducting layer could hold 1,000 kilograms.": 1,
    " a small car in my hand.": 1,
    " Amazing.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
