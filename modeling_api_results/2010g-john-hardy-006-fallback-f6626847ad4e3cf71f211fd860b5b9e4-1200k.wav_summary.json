    " I had a really hard time in school.": 1,
    " In fact, my mother told me eventually that I was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school.": 1,
    " I ran away.": 1,
    "I left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali.": 1,
    " And there I met my incredible wife, Cynthia, and together over 20 years we built an amazing jewelry business.": 1,
    " It was a fairy tale.": 1,
    "And then we retired.": 1,
    "Then she took me to see a film that I really didn't want to see.": 1,
    "It ruined my life.": 1,
    " The Inconvenient Truth and Mr. Gore.": 1,
    "I have four kids.": 1,
    " And even if part of what he says is true, they're not going to have the life that I had.": 1,
    "And I decided at that moment,": 1,
    " that I would spend the rest of my life doing whatever I could.": 1,
    " to improve their possibilities.": 1,
    "So here's the world, and here we are in Bali.": 1,
    " It's a tiny little island 60 miles by 90 miles.": 1,
    "It has an intact Hindu culture.": 1,
    "Cynthia and I were there.": 1,
    "We had had": 1,

    "And we practice wholism.": 1,

    " chances are she'll demand a whole world, a whole world to live on.": 1,
    "Our children spend 181 days": 1,
    " going to school in a box.": 1,
    " The people that built my school also built the prison and the insane asylum out of the same materials.": 1,
    " So if this gentleman had have had a holistic education, would he be sitting there?": 1,
    "Would he have had more possibilities in his life?": 1,
    " The classrooms have natural light.": 1,
    "They're beautiful.": 1,
    "They're bamboo.": 1,
    " the breeze passes through them.": 1,
    "And when the natural breeze isn't enough, the kids deploy bubbles, but not the kind of bubbles you know.": 1,
    "These bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree.": 1,
    " So we basically turned the box into a bubble.": 1,
    "And these kids know that painless climate control may not be part of their future.": 1,
    " We pay the bill at the end of the month, but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren.": 1,
    " We have to teach the kids that the world is not indestructible.": 1,

    " And you know what these are.": 1,

    "How many people times how much water?": 1,
    " There isn't enough water.": 1,
    "These are compost toilets.": 1,
    "And nobody at the school wanted to know about them, especially the principal.": 1,
    " And they work.": 1,
    "People use them.": 1,
    "People are okay.": 1,
    "It's something you should think about doing.": 1,
    " Not many things didn't work.": 1,
    "The beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun in six months.": 1,
    "We had to replace them with recyclable plastic.": 1,

    "I got on an airplane in August.": 1,
    "I'm bringing my sons.": 1,
    " This was a great thing.": 1,
    "But more than that, people are building green houses around green school so their kids can walk to school on the paths.": 1,
    "And people are bringing their green industries, hopefully their green restaurants.": 1,
    " to the green school.": 1,
    "It's becoming a community.": 1,
    "It's becoming a green model.": 1,
    "We had to look at everything.": 1,
    " No petrochemicals in the pavement.": 1,

    "The mothers aren't quite convinced.": 1,
    " We've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives and we said, okay, local, what does local mean?": 1,
    "Local means that 20% of the population of the school has to be Balinese.": 1,
    " And this was a really big commitment.": 1,
    "And we were right.": 1,
    "And people are coming forward from all over the world.": 1,
    " to support the Balinese Scholarship Fund because these kids will be Bali's next green leaders.": 1,
    "The teachers are as diverse as the student body and the amazing thing is that volunteers are popping up.": 1,

    "And all the kids are thriving.": 1,
    "And how did we do all this?": 1,
    "On giant grass.": 1,
    " It's bamboo.": 1,
    " It comes out of the ground like a train.": 1,
    "It grows as high as a coconut tree in two months.": 1,
    " And three years later, it can be harvested to build buildings like this.": 1,
    "It's as strong and dense as teak, and it will hold up any roof.": 1,
    " When the architects came, they brought us these things.": 1,
    "And you've probably seen things like this.": 1,
    "The yellow box was called the administration complex.": 1,
    " We squashed it, we rethought it, but mainly we renamed it the heart of school.": 1,
    "And that changed everything forever.": 1,
    "It's a double helix.": 1,
    "It has administrators in it and many, many other things.": 1,
    " And the problem of building it, when the Balinese workers saw long reams of plans, they looked at them and said,": 1,
    " What's this?": 1,
    "So we built big models, we had them engineered by the engineers, and Balinese carpenters like this measured them with their bamboo rulers, selected the bamboo and built the buildings.": 1,
    " using age-old techniques, mostly by hand.": 1,
    " It was chaos, and the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do, so they used metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building.": 1,
    " and when the scaffolding came down.": 1,
    " we realized that we had a cathedral.": 1,
    "A cathedral to green.": 1,
    " and a cathedral to green education.": 1,
    "The heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it.": 1,
    "From the time the foundations were finished in three months, it had roofs.": 1,
    " and floors.": 1,
    "It may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world, but many people believe that it's the most beautiful.": 1,
    " Is this doable in your community?": 1,
    "We believe it is.": 1,
    "Green School is a model we built for the world.": 1,
    " It's a model we built for Bali.": 1,
    "And you just have to follow these simple, simple rules.": 1,
    "Be local, let the environment lead, and think about how your grandchildren might build.": 1,
    " So, Mr. Gore, thank you.": 1,
    "You ruined my life, but you gave me an incredible future.": 1,
