    " Meet Tony.": 1,
    "He's my student.": 1,
    "He's about my age, and he's in San Quentin State Prison.": 1,
    "When Tony was 16 years old,": 1,
    " One day, one moment.": 1,
    " It was mom's gun.": 1,
    "Just flash it, scare the guy.": 1,
    "He's a punk.": 1,
    "He took some money.": 1,
    "We'll take his money.": 1,
    "That'll teach him.": 1,
    "Then last minute I'm thinking, can't do this.": 1,
    "This is wrong.": 1,
    "My buddy says, come on, let's do this.": 1,
    "I say,": 1,
    " Let's do this.": 1,
    " And those three words Tony's gonna remember.": 1,
    "Because the next thing he knows, he hears the pop, there's the punk on the ground, puddle of blood, and that's felony murder.": 1,
    "25 to life, parole at 50 if you're lucky, and Tony's not feeling very lucky.": 1,
    " So when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison, and I say, in this class we will discuss the foundations of ethics, Tony interrupts me.": 1,
    " What are you going to teach me about right and wrong?": 1,
    "I know what is wrong.": 1,
    "I have done wrong.": 1,
    "I am told every day by every face I see, every wall I face that I am wrong.": 1,
    " If I ever get out of here, there will always be a mark by my name.": 1,
    "I'm a convict.": 1,
    "I am branded wrong.": 1,
    "What are you going to tell me about right and wrong?": 1,
    " Should I say to Tony, sorry, but it's worse than you think.": 1,
    " You think you know right and wrong?": 1,
    "Then can you tell me what wrong is?": 1,
    "No, don't just give me an example.": 1,
    "I want to know about wrongness itself, the idea of wrong.": 1,
    "What is that idea?": 1,
    "What makes something wrong?": 1,
    " How do we know that it's wrong?": 1,
    "Maybe you and I disagree.": 1,
    "Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong.": 1,
    "Maybe it's you, maybe it's me.": 1,
    "But we're not here to trade opinions.": 1,
    "Everyone's got an opinion.": 1,
    "We are here for knowledge.": 1,
    "Our enemy is thoughtlessness.": 1,
    "This is philosophy.": 1,
    " and something changes for Tony.": 1,
    " Could be I'm wrong.": 1,
    "I'm tired of being wrong.": 1,
    "I want to know what is wrong.": 1,
    "I want to know what I know.": 1,
    " What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy.": 1,
    "The project that begins in wonder.": 1,
    "What Kant called admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within.": 1,
    "What can creatures like us know of such things?": 1,
    " It is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence, what Heidegger called the always already there.": 1,
    "It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it, what Socrates called the examined life.": 1,
    "Socrates, a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing,": 1,
    " Socrates died in prison.": 1,
    " his philosophy intact.": 1,
    "So, Tony starts doing his homework.": 1,
    "He learns his whys and wherefores, his causes and correlations, his logic, his fallacies.": 1,
    "Turns out Tony's got the philosophy muscle.": 1,
    "His body's in prison, but his mind is free.": 1,
    " Tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous, the epistemologically anxious, the ethically dubious, the metaphysically ridiculous.": 1,
    "That's Plato, Descartes, Nietzsche, and Bill Clinton.": 1,
    " When he gives me his final paper in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with a conflict that infects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether, therefore, we are condemned to moral failure, I say,": 1,
    " I don't know.": 1,
    "Let us think about that.": 1,
    "Because in that moment, there's no mark by Tony's name.": 1,
    "It's just the two of us standing there.": 1,
    "It is not professor and convict.": 1,
    "It is just two minds ready to do philosophy.": 1,
    "And I say to Tony, let's do this.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
