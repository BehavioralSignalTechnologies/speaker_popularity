    " I collaborate with bacteria and I'm about to show you some stop-motion footage that I made recently where you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals from their environment over a period of an hour.": 1,
    " So what you're seeing here is the bacteria metabolizing and as they do so, they create electrical charge and this attracts metals from their local environment.": 1,
    " and these metals accumulate as minerals on the surface of the bacteria.": 1,
    "One of the most pervasive problems in the world today for people is inadequate access to clean drinking water.": 1,
    " And the desalination process is one where we take out salts and we can use it for drinking and agriculture.": 1,
    "But removing the salts from water, in particular seawater through reverse osmosis, is a critical technique.": 1,
    " for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe.": 1,
    "So seawater reverse osmosis is a membrane filtration technology.": 1,
    " We take the water from the sea and we apply a pressure.": 1,
    "And this pressure forces the seawater through a membrane.": 1,
    "This takes energy, producing clean water.": 1,
    " But we're also left with a concentrated salt solution or brine.": 1,
    "But the process is very expensive and it's cost prohibitive for many countries around the globe.": 1,
    "And also the brine that's produced": 1,
    " is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea.": 1,
    "And this is detrimental to the local ecology of the sea area that it's pumped back out into.": 1,
    " So I work in Singapore at the moment, and this is a place that's really a leading place for desalination technology, and Singapore proposes by 2060 to produce 9 million liters per day of desalinated water.": 1,
    " But this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine.": 1,
    "And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play.": 1,
    " So what we're doing at the moment is we're accumulating metals like calcium, potassium and magnesium from out of desalination brine.": 1,
    " And this in terms of magnesium and the amounts of water that I just mentioned equates to a 4.5 US billion dollar": 1,
    " mining industry for Singapore, a place that doesn't have any natural resources.": 1,
    "So I'd like you to imagine a mining industry in a way that one hasn't existed before.": 1,
    " Imagine a mining industry that doesn't mean defiling the earth.": 1,
    "And imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine.": 1,
    " And what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube, a mining industry that is in harmony with nature.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
