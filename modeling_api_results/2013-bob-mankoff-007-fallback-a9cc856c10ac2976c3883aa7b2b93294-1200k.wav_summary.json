    " We're going to be talking about designing humor, which is sort of an interesting thing.": 1,
    "But it goes to some of the discussions about constraints and how, in a certain context, humor is right.": 1,
    "In another context, it's wrong.": 1,
    " Now, I'm from New York, so it's 100% satisfaction.": 1,
    " Actually, that's ridiculous because when it comes to humor, 75% is really absolutely the best you can hope for.": 1,
    "Nobody is ever satisfied 100% with humor except this woman.": 1,
    " Ha ha!": 1,
    " Ha ha ha!": 1,
    " My first wife.": 1,
    " That part of the relationship went fine.": 1,
    " Now, let's look at this cartoon.": 1,
    "One of the things I'm pointing is that cartoons appear within the context of the New Yorker magazine.": 1,
    " That lovely Kazan type.": 1,
    "And it seems like a fairly benign cartoon within this context.": 1,
    "They're making a little bit fun of getting older, and you know, people might like it.": 1,
    "But like I said, you cannot satisfy everyone.": 1,
    "You couldn't satisfy this guy.": 1,
    " Another joke on all white males, haha the wit.": 1,
    "It's nice I'm sure to be young and rude but someday you'll be old unless you drop dead as I do.": 1,
    " The New Yorker is rather a sensitive environment.": 1,
    "Very easy for people to get their nose at a joint.": 1,
    "And one of the things that you realize is it's an unusual environment.": 1,
    "Here, I'm one person talking to you.": 1,
    "You're all collective.": 1,
    " You all hear each other laugh and know each other laugh.": 1,
    "In the New York, it goes out to a wide audience.": 1,
    "And when you actually look at that, nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at.": 1,
    "And when you look at that, the subject": 1,
    " involved in humor is really interesting.": 1,
    "Let's look at this cartoon, discouraging data on the antidepressant.": 1,
    " Indeed, it is described.": 1,
    " Now you would think, well, look, most of you laughed at that, right?": 1,
    "You thought it was funny.": 1,
    "In general, that seems like a funny cartoon, but let's look what online survey I did.": 1,
    " Generally, about 85% of the people liked it.": 1,
    "109 voted it a 10, the highest 10 voted it a 1.": 1,
    "But look at the individual responses.": 1,
    "I like animals.": 1,
    "Look how much they like them.": 1,
    " I don't want to hurt them, that doesn't seem very funny to me.": 1,
    "This person I rated two.": 1,
    "I don't like to see animals suffer, even in cartoons.": 1,
    " To people like this, I point out we use anesthetic ink.": 1,
    " Other people thought it was funny.": 1,
    "That actually is the true nature of the distribution of humor when you don't have the contagion of humor.": 1,
    " Humor is a type of entertainment.": 1,
    "All entertainment contains a little frisson of danger, something that might happen wrong.": 1,
    "And yet we like it when there's protection.": 1,
    "That's what a zoo is.": 1,
    "There's danger, the tiger is there, the bars protect us.": 1,
    " That's sort of fun, right?": 1,
    "That's a bad zoo.": 1,
    " It's a very politically correct zoo, but it's a bad zoo, but this is a worse one.": 1,
    " So in dealing with humor in the context of the New Yorker, you have to see where is that tiger going to be?": 1,
    "Where is the danger going to exist?": 1,
    "How are you going to manage it?": 1,
    "My job": 1,
    " is to look at 1,000 cartoons a week.": 1,
    "But the New Yorker can only take 16 or 17 cartoons.": 1,
    " and we have a thousand cartoons, of course many, many cartoons must be rejected.": 1,
    "Now, we could fit more cartoons in the magazine if we remove the articles.": 1,
    " But I feel that would be a huge loss.": 1,
    " One I could live with, but still use.": 1,
    " Cartoonists come into the magazine every week.": 1,
    "Average cartoonist who stays with the magazine does 10 or 15 ideas every week.": 1,
    "But they're mostly going to be rejected.": 1,
    "That's the nature of any creative activity.": 1,
    " Many of them fade away.": 1,
    "Some of them stay.": 1,
    "Matt Diffie is one of them.": 1,
    "Here's one of his cartoons.": 1,
    " Drew Dernovich, a county knight at the improv.": 1,
    "Now is the part of the show when we ask the audience to shout out some random numbers.": 1,
    " Paul Noth.": 1,
    "He's all right.": 1,
    "I just wish he was a little more pro-Israel.": 1,
    " Now, I know all about rejection because when I quit, I actually was booted out of psychology school and decided to become a cartoonist, a natural segue.": 1,
    " From 1974 to 1977, I submitted 2,000 cartoons to the New Yorker and got 2,000 cartoons rejected by the New Yorker.": 1,
    " At a certain point, this rejection slip in 1977 magically changed to this.": 1,
    " Now of course that's not what happened, but that's the emotional truth.": 1,
    " And of course, that is not New Yorker humor.": 1,
    "What is New Yorker humor?": 1,
    "Well, after 1977, I broke into the New Yorker storytelling cartoons.": 1,
    "Finally, in 1980, I received the revered New Yorker contract.": 1,
    " Which I blurred out part because it's none of your business.": 1,
    " from 1980, dear Mr. Mankoff, confirming the agreement, blah, blah, blah, blah, blur, for any idea drawings, with respect to idea drawings, nowhere in the contract does the word cartoon mention.": 1,
    " the word idea drawings, and that's the sine qua non of New Yorker cartoons.": 1,
    "So what is an idea drawing?": 1,
    "An idea drawing is something that": 1,
    " requires you to think.": 1,
    "Now that's not a cartoon.": 1,
    "It requires thinking on the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part to make it into a cartoon.": 1,
    " Here are some of, generally you get my cast of cartoon mind.": 1,
    "There is no justice in the world, there is some justice in the world, the world is just.": 1,
    " This is what Lemmings believes.": 1,
    " Yeah.": 1,
    " The New Yorker and I, when we make comments, the cartoon carries a certain ambiguity about what it actually is.": 1,
    "What is the cartoon?": 1,
    "Is it really about Lemmings?": 1,
    "It's about us.": 1,
    " You know, it's my view basically about religion, that the real conflict and all the fights between religion is, who has the best imaginary friend?": 1,
    " And this is my most well-known cartoon, no Thursdays out, how about never is never good for you.": 1,
    " It's been reprinted thousands of times, totally ripped off.": 1,
    "It's even on thongs.": 1,
    "But compressed to how about never?": 1,
    "It's never good for you.": 1,
    " Now these look like very different forms of humor, but actually they bear a great similarity.": 1,
    "In each instance, our expectations": 1,
    " are defied.": 1,
    "In each instance, the narrative gets switched.": 1,
    "There's an incongruity and a contrast.": 1,
    "In No Thursdays Out, How About Never is never good for you, what you have is the syntax of politeness and the message being rude.": 1,
    " That really is how humor works.": 1,
    "It's a cognitive synergy where we mash up these two things, which don't go together and temporarily in our minds exist.": 1,
    "He is both being polite and rude.": 1,
    "In here,": 1,
    " You have the propriety of the New Yorker and the vulgarity of the language.": 1,
    "Basically, that's the way humor works.": 1,
    "So, I'm a humor analyst, you would say.": 1,
    "Now, E.B.": 1,
    "White said, analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog.": 1,
    "Nobody's much interested in the frog dies.": 1,
    " Well, I'm gonna kill a few, but there won't be any genocide.": 1,
    " But really it makes me, let's look at this picture.": 1,
    "This is an interesting picture.": 1,
    "The laughing audience.": 1,
    "There are the people, fops up there, but everybody is laughing.": 1,
    "Everybody is laughing except one guy.": 1,
    " This guy.": 1,
    "Who is he?": 1,
    "He's the critic.": 1,
    " He's the critic of humor and really I'm forced to be in that position when I'm at the New Yorker and that's the danger that I will become.": 1,
    " this guy.": 1,
    "Now, here's a little video made by Matt Diffey, sort of how they imagine if we really exaggerated that.": 1,
    " Ehh...": 1,
    " Ooh.": 1,
    "Hmm.": 1,
    "Too funny.": 1,
    " Normally I'd work, but I'm in a pissy mood.": 1,
    " of my own, perhaps.": 1,
    "No, nah, no.": 1,
    "Overdrawn, underdrawn.": 1,
    " No.": 1,
    "For God's sakes, no a thousand times.": 1,
    " Hey, that's good.": 1,
    "Yeah, what you got there?": 1,
    "You got a ham and Swiss on, right?": 1,
    "Okay, uh... What's driving you out Saturday?": 1,
    "No, but no, no, no.": 1,
    "Smoked turkey with bacon?": 1,
    "Falafel?": 1,
    "Let me look at it.": 1,
    "No, no, no.": 1,
    " Grilled cheese?": 1,
    "EOT.": 1,
    "Black horse ham and mustard with apple mustard.": 1,
    "Green bean salad.": 1,
    " Definitely no.": 1,
    " We need help!": 1,
    " Get out of here.": 1,
    " That's sort of an exaggeration of what I do.": 1,
    " Now, we reject many, many, many cartoons, so many that there are many books called the rejection collection.": 1,
    "The rejection collection is not quite New Yorker kind of humor.": 1,
    " You might notice the bum on the sidewalk here who's boozing and his ventriloquist dummy is puking.": 1,
    "See, that's probably not going to be New Yorker humor.": 1,
    "It's actually put together by Matt Diffie, one of our cartoonists.": 1,
    "I'll give you some examples of rejection collection.": 1,
    " humor it.": 1,
    "I'm thinking about having a child.": 1,
    " There you have an interesting, the guilty laugh.": 1,
    " The laugh against your better judgment.": 1,
    " Ass head, please help.": 1,
    " Ha ha.": 1,
    " Now, in fact, within the context of this book, which says, cartoons you never saw or never will see in the New Yorker, this humor is perfect.": 1,
    "I'm going to explain why.": 1,
    "There's a concept about humor about it being a benign violation.": 1,
    " In other words, for something to be funny, we've got to think it's both wrong and also okay at the same time.": 1,
    "If we think it's completely wrong, we say that's not funny.": 1,
    " And if it's completely okay, what's the joke?": 1,
    "Okay?": 1,
    "And so this benign, that's true of no Thursdays out.": 1,
    "How about never, never good for you?": 1,
    "It's rude.": 1,
    "The world really shouldn't be that way.": 1,
    "Within that context, we feel it's okay.": 1,
    " So within this context, Asshad, please help, is a benign violation.": 1,
    "Within the context of the New Yorker magazine.": 1,
    " T cell army, can the body's immune response help treat cancer?": 1,
    "Oh, goodness.": 1,
    "You're reading about this smart stuff.": 1,
    " this intelligent dissection of the immune system.": 1,
    "You glance over at this and he says, ass head, please help.": 1,
    "God!": 1,
    " So there, the violation is maligned.": 1,
    "It doesn't work.": 1,
    "There is no such thing as funny in and of itself.": 1,
    "Everything will be within the context and our expectations.": 1,
    " One way to look at it is this.": 1,
    "It's sort of called a metamotivational theory about how we look.": 1,
    "A theory about motivation and the mood we're in and how the mood we're in determines the things we like or dislike.": 1,
    " When we're in a playful mood, we want excitement.": 1,
    "We want high arousal.": 1,
    "We feel excited then.": 1,
    "If we're in a purposeful mood, that makes us anxious.": 1,
    " The rejection collection is absolutely in this field.": 1,
    "You want to be stimulated, you want to be aroused, you want to be transgressed.": 1,
    " It's like this, like an amusement park.": 1,
    " Go!": 1,
    " you now.": 1,
    " He is both in danger and safe, incredibly aroused.": 1,
    "There's no joke, no joke needed.": 1,
    "If you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough, they will laugh at very, very little.": 1,
    "This is another cartoon from the Rejection Collection.": 1,
    "Too snug.": 1,
    " I like the cartoon of bad terrorism.": 1,
    "The New Yorker occupies a very different space.": 1,
    "It's a space that is playful in its own way and also purposeful.": 1,
    "And in that space,": 1,
    " The cartoons are different.": 1,
    "Now I'm going to show you cartoons the New Yorker did right after 9-11.": 1,
    "Very, very sensitive area when humor could be used.": 1,
    "How would the New Yorker attack it?": 1,
    "It would not be with a guy with a bomb staying too snug.": 1,
    " Well, there was another cartoon I didn't show because I actually thought maybe people would be offended.": 1,
    "The great Sam Groves cartoon.": 1,
    "This happened after the Mohammed controversy where": 1,
    " It's Mohammed in heaven.": 1,
    "The suicide bomber is all in little pieces and he's saying to the suicide bomber You'll get the virgin when we find your penis": 1,
    " Better left undrawn.": 1,
    " The first week we did no cartoons.": 1,
    "That was a black hole for humor, and correctly so.": 1,
    "It's not always appropriate every time.": 1,
    "But the next week, this was the first cartoon.": 1,
    "I thought I'd never laugh again then I saw your jacket.": 1,
    " It basically was about if we were alive, we were gonna laugh, we were gonna breathe, we were gonna exist.": 1,
    "Here's another one.": 1,
    " I figure if I don't have that third martini, then the terrorist will.": 1,
    " These cartoons are not about them, they're about us.": 1,
    "The humor reflects back on us.": 1,
    "The easiest thing to do with humor, and it's perfectly legitimate, is a friend makes fun of an enemy.": 1,
    " It's called dispositional humor.": 1,
    "It's 95% of the humor.": 1,
    "It's not our humor.": 1,
    "Here's another cartoon.": 1,
    " I wouldn't mind living in a fundamentally Islamic state.": 1,
    " Human does need a target.": 1,
    " But interestingly in the New Yorker, the target is us.": 1,
    "The target is the readership and the people who do it.": 1,
    "The humor is self-reflective and makes us think about our assumptions.": 1,
    " Look at this cartoon by Raj Chast, the guy reading the obituary.": 1,
    "Two years younger than you, 12 years older than you, three years your junior, your age on the dot, exactly your age.": 1,
    " That is a deeply profound cartoon.": 1,
    "And so the New Yorker is also trying to, in some way, make cartoons say something besides funny and something about us.": 1,
    " Here's another one.": 1,
    "I started my vegetarianism for health reasons.": 1,
    "Then it became a moral choice, and now it's just too annoyed.": 1,
    " Excuse me, I think there's something wrong with this in a tiny way that no one other than me would ever be able to paint.": 1,
    " So it focuses on our obsessions, our narcissism, our foils, and our foibles really not someone else's.": 1,
    " The New Yorker demands some cognitive work on your part.": 1,
    "And what it demands is what Arthur Kessler, who wrote The Act of Creation about the relationship between humor": 1,
    " art and science is what's called bisociation.": 1,
    "You have to bring together ideas from different frames of reference and you have to do it quickly to understand the cartoon.": 1,
    " If the different frames of reference don't come together in about 0.5 seconds, it's not funny, but they will for you here.": 1,
    "Different frames of reference.": 1,
    "You slept with her, didn't you?": 1,
    " That's see, get help.": 1,
    " called French Army Knife.": 1,
    " And this is Einstein in bed.": 1,
    "To you it was fast.": 1,
    " Now there are some cartoons that are puzzling.": 1,
    "Like this cartoon would puzzle many people.": 1,
    " How many people know what this cartoon means?": 1,
    " The dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk.": 1,
    " This is the signal for a catcher to walk the dog.": 1,
    " That's why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year called I Don't Get It, the New Yorker Cartoon IQ Test.": 1,
    " The other thing the New Yorker plays around with is incongruity, and incongruity I've shown is sort of the basis of humor.": 1,
    "Something that's completely normal or logical isn't going to be funny.": 1,
    " But the way incongruity works is observational humor is humor within the realm of reality.": 1,
    "My boss is always telling me what to do.": 1,
    " Okay, that could happen if you were within the realm of reality.": 1,
    "Here, cowboy to cow.": 1,
    "Very impressive, I'd like to find 5,000 more like you.": 1,
    " We understand that, it's absurd, but we're putting the two together.": 1,
    "Here, in the nonsense range,": 1,
    " Damn it, Hopkins, didn't you get yesterday's memo?": 1,
    " Now that's a little puzzling, right?": 1,
    "It doesn't quite come together.": 1,
    "In general, people who enjoy more nonsense enjoy more abstract art.": 1,
    "They tend to be liberal, less conservative, that type of stuff.": 1,
    " But for us and for me, helping design the humor, it doesn't make any sense to compare one to the other.": 1,
    "It's sort of a smorgasbord that's made all interesting.": 1,
    " So I want to sum all this up with a caption to a cartoon.": 1,
    " And I think this sums up the whole thing, really, about the New Yorker cartoons.": 1,
    "Sort of makes you stop and think, doesn't it?": 1,
    " And now when you look at New Yorker cartoons, I'd like you to stop and think a little bit more about them.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
