    " I have the feeling that we can all agree that we're moving towards a new model of the state and society, but we are absolutely clueless as to what this is or what it should be.": 1,
    " It seems like we need to have a conversation about democracy in our day and age.": 1,
    "Let's think about it this way.": 1,
    " We are 21st century citizens doing our very, very best to interact with 19th century design institutions.": 1,
    " that are based on an information technology of the 15th century.": 1,
    "Let's have a look at some of the characteristics of this system.": 1,
    " First of all, it's designed for an information technology that's over 500 years old.": 1,
    "And the best possible system that could be designed for it is one where the few": 1,
    " make daily decisions in name of the many, and the many get to vote once every couple of years.": 1,
    " On the second place, the costs of participating in the system are incredibly high.": 1,
    "You either have to have a fair bit of money and influence, or you have to...": 1,
    " devote your entire life to politics.": 1,
    "You have to become a party member and slowly start working up the ranks until maybe one day you'll get to sit at a table where the decision is being made.": 1,
    " And last but not least, the language of the system, it's incredibly cryptic.": 1,
    "It's done for lawyers, by lawyers.": 1,
    "And no one else can understand.": 1,
    " So it's a system where we can choose our authorities, but we are completely left out on how those authorities reach their decisions.": 1,
    " So in a day where a new information technology allows us to participate globally in any conversation, our barriers of information are completely lowered.": 1,
    " and we can, more than ever before, express our desires and our concerns.": 1,
    "Our political system remains the same for the past 200 years.": 1,
    " and expects us to be contented with being simply passive recipients of a monologue.": 1,
    " So it's really not surprising, isn't it, that this kind of system is only able to produce two kinds of results.": 1,
    " Silence or noise?": 1,
    "Silence in terms of citizens not engaging, just simply not wanting to participate.": 1,
    " There's this common place that I truly, truly dislike, and it's this idea that we citizens are naturally apathetic, that we shun commitment.": 1,
    " But can you really blame us for not jumping at the opportunity of going to the middle of the city in the middle of a working day to attend physically a public hearing that has no impact whatsoever?": 1,
    " Conflict is bound to happen between a system that no longer represents nor has any dialogue capacity.": 1,
    " and citizens that are increasingly used at representing themselves.": 1,
    "And then we find noise.": 1,
    " Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Italy, France, Spain, the United States, they're all democracies.": 1,
    "The citizens have access to the ballot boxes.": 1,
    " but they still feel the need, they need to take on the streets in order to be heard.": 1,
    " To me, it seems like the 18th century slogan that was the basis for the formation of our modern democracies": 1,
    " no taxation without representation can now be updated to no representation without a conversation.": 1,
    " We want our seat at the table.": 1,
    " And rightly so.": 1,
    "But in order to be part of this conversation, we need to know what we want to do next.": 1,
    " Because political action is being able to move from meditation to construction.": 1,
    " My generation has been incredibly good at using new networks and technologies to organize protests.": 1,
    "Protests that were able to successfully impose agendas,": 1,
    " roll back extremely pernicious legislation, and even overthrow authoritarian governments.": 1,
    "And we should be immensely proud of this.": 1,
    " But we also must admit that we haven't been good at using those same networks and technologies to successfully articulate an alternative to what we're seeing.": 1,
    " and find the consensus and build the alliances that are needed to make it happen.": 1,
    " And so the risk that we face is that we can create these huge power vacuums that will very quickly get filled up by de facto powers like the military.": 1,
    " or highly motivated and already organized groups that generally lie on the extremes.": 1,
    " But a democracy is neither just a matter of voting once every couple of years, but it's not either the ability to bring millions onto the streets.": 1,
    " So the question I'd like to raise here, and I do believe it's the most important question we need to answer, is this one.": 1,
    "If Internet is the new printing press, then what is democracy for the Internet era?": 1,
    " What institutions do we want to build for a 21st century society?": 1,
    " I don't have the answer, just in case.": 1,
    "I don't think no one does.": 1,
    "But I truly believe it is, we can't afford to ignore this question anymore.": 1,
    " So I'd like to share our experience and what we've learned so far, and hopefully contribute two cents to this conversation.": 1,
    " Two years ago, with a group of friends from Argentina, we started thinking, how can we get our representatives, our elected representatives to represent us?": 1,
    " Marshall McLuhan once said that politics is solving today's problems with yesterday's tools.": 1,
    " So the question that motivated us was, can we try and solve some of today's problems with the tools that we use every single day of our lives?": 1,
    " Our first approach was to design and develop a piece of software called Democracy OS.": 1,
    " Democracy is an open source web application that is designed to become a bridge between citizens and their elected representatives to make it easier for us to participate from our everyday lives.": 1,
    " So first of all, you can get informed.": 1,
    "So every new project that gets introduced in Congress gets immediately translated and explained in plain language on this platform.": 1,
    " But we all know that social change is not going to come from just knowing more information, but from doing something with it.": 1,
    " So better access to information should lead to a conversation about what we're going to do next.": 1,
    "And Democracy US allows for that.": 1,
    " Because we believe that democracy is not just a matter of stacking up preferences one on top of each other, but that a healthy and robust public debate should be once again one of its fundamental values.": 1,
    " So democracy is about persuading and being persuaded.": 1,
    "It's about reaching a consensus as much as finding a proper way of channeling our disagreement.": 1,
    "And finally, you can vote.": 1,
    " how you would like your elected representative to vote.": 1,
    "And if you do not feel comfortable voting on a certain issue, you can always delegate your vote to someone else, allowing for a dynamic and emerging social": 1,
    " leadership.": 1,
    " It suddenly became very easy for us to simply compare these results with how our representatives were voting in Congress.": 1,
    "But it also became very evident that technology was not going to do the trick.": 1,
    " What we needed to do was to find actors that were able to grab this distributed knowledge in society and use it to make better and more fair decisions.": 1,
    " So we reached out to traditional political parties and we offered them Democracy OS.": 1,
    "We said, look, here you have a platform that you can use to build a two-way conversation with your constituencies.": 1,
    " And yes, we failed.": 1,
    "We failed big time.": 1,
    "We were, you know, sent to play outside like little kids.": 1,
    " Amongst other things, we were called naive, and I must be honest, I think in hindsight we were.": 1,
    "Because the challenges that we face, they're not technological, they're cultural.": 1,
    " political parties were never willing to change the way they make their decisions.": 1,
    "So it suddenly became a bit obvious that if we wanted to move forward with this idea, we needed to do it ourselves.": 1,
    " And so we took quite a leap of faith, and in August last year, we founded our own political party, El Partido de la Red, or The Net Party in the city of Buenos Aires.": 1,
    " And taking an even bigger leap of faith, we ran for elections on October last year with this idea.": 1,
    " If we want to sit in Congress, our candidates, our representatives, we're always going to vote according to what citizens decided on Democracy IS.": 1,
    " Every single project that got introduced in Congress, we were going to vote according to what citizens decided on an online platform.": 1,
    "It was our way of hacking the political system.": 1,
    " We understood that if we wanted to become part of the conversation, to have a seat at the table, we needed to become valid stakeholders.": 1,
    "And the only way of doing it is to play by the system rules.": 1,
    " But we were hacking it in the sense that we were radically changing the way a political party makes its decisions.": 1,
    " For the first time, we were making our decisions together with those who we were affecting directly by those decisions.": 1,
    " It was a very bold move for a two-month-old party in the city of Buenos Aires.": 1,
    " But it got attention.": 1,
    "We got 22,000 votes.": 1,
    "That's 1.2% of the votes.": 1,
    "And we came in second for the local options.": 1,
    " So even if that wasn't enough to win a seat in Congress, it was enough for us to become part of the conversation.": 1,
    " to the extent that next month where Congress as an institution is launching for the first time in Argentina's history a democracy as to discuss with the citizens three pieces of legislation.": 1,
    " two on urban transportation, and one on the use of public space.": 1,
    "Of course, our elected representatives are not saying, yes, we're going to vote according to what citizens decide, but they're willing to try.": 1,
    " They're willing to open up a new space for citizen engagement and hopefully they're willing to listen as well.": 1,
    "Our political system can be transformed.": 1,
    " And not by subverting it, by destroying it, but by rewiring it with the tools that internet affords us now.": 1,
    "But a real challenge.": 1,
    " is to find, to design, to create, to empower those connectors that are able to innovate, to transform noise and silence into signal and": 1,
    " finally bring our democracies to the 21st century.": 1,
    "I'm not saying it's easy.": 1,
    " But in our experience, we actually stand a chance of making it work.": 1,
    "And in my heart, it's most definitely worth trying.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
