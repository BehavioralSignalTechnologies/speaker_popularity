    " Thank you.": 2,
    " How many still don't see it?": 2,
    " So I'm going to speak about a problem that I have, and that's that I'm a philosopher.": 1,
    " When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do and I say I'm a professor, their eyes glaze over.": 1,
    " When I go to an academic cocktail party, and there's all the professors around, they ask me what field I'm in, and I say philosophy.": 1,
    "Their eyes glaze over.": 1,
    " When I go to a philosopher's party,": 1,
    " And they ask me what I work on, and I say, consciousness.": 1,
    "Their eyes don't glaze over.": 1,
    "Their lips curl into a snarl.": 1,
    " And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because": 1,
    " they think.": 1,
    "That's impossible.": 1,
    "You can't explain consciousness.": 1,
    "The very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question.": 1,
    "My late lamented friend Bob Nozick, fine philosopher in": 1,
    " one of his books Philosophical Explanation.": 1,
    " He's commenting on the ethos of philosophy, the way philosophers go about their business, and he says,": 1,
    " You know, philosophers love rational argument.": 1,
    "He says, it seems as if the ideal argument for most philosophers is": 1,
    " You give your audience the premises, and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion.": 1,
    " And if they don't accept the conclusion, they die.": 1,
    " Your heads explode.": 1,
    "The idea is to have an argument that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents.": 1,
    "But in fact, that doesn't change people's minds at all.": 1,
    "It's very hard to change people's minds about something like consciousness.": 1,
    " I finally figured out the reason for that.": 1,
    "The reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness.": 1,
    "We heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games.": 1,
    " They all have an idea for a video game, even if they're not experts.": 1,
    "But they don't consider themselves experts in video games.": 1,
    "They've just got strong opinions.": 1,
    "I'm sure that people here who work on, say,": 1,
    " climate change and global warming, or on the future of the internet, they encounter people who have very strong opinions about": 1,
    " what's going to happen next.": 1,
    "But they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise.": 1,
    "They're just strongly held opinions.": 1,
    "But with regard to consciousness, people seem to think": 1,
    " Each of us seems to think, I am an expert.": 1,
    "Simply by being conscious, I know all about this.": 1,
    "And so you tell them your theory, and they say, no, no, that's not the way consciousness is.": 1,
    "No, you got it all wrong.": 1,
    "And they say this with an amazing confidence.": 1,
    " And so what I'm going to try to do today is to shake your confidence, because I know the feeling.": 1,
    "I can feel it myself.": 1,
    "I want to shake your confidence that you know": 1,
    " your own innermost minds, that you are yourselves authoritative about your own consciousness.": 1,
    " That's the order of the day here.": 1,
    "Now, this nice picture shows a thought balloon or thought bubble, which is, I think everybody understands what that means.": 1,
    "That's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness.": 1,
    " This is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done.": 1,
    "It's a Saul Steinberg, of course.": 1,
    "It was a New Yorker cover.": 1,
    " Fellow here is looking at the Brach painting.": 1,
    "It's by Brach.": 1,
    "That reminds him of the word baroque, barrack, bark, poodle, Suzanne R. He's off to the races.": 1,
    " There's a wonderful stream of consciousness here, and if you follow it along, you learn a lot about this man.": 1,
    "What I particularly like about this picture, too, is that Steinberg has rendered the guy in this sort of pointy-east style.": 1,
    " Which reminds us, as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday, what we are, what each of us is, what you are, what I am, is approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots.": 1,
    " That's what we're made of.": 1,
    "No other ingredients at all.": 1,
    "We're just made of cells, about 100 trillion of them.": 1,
    "Not a single one of those cells is conscious.": 1,
    "Not a single one of those cells knows who you are or cares.": 1,
    " Somehow we have to explain how when you put together teams, armies, battalions of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells, not so different really from a bacterium, each one of them.": 1,
    " The result is this.": 1,
    "I mean, just look at it.": 1,
    "The content.": 1,
    "There's color.": 1,
    "There's ideas.": 1,
    "There's memories.": 1,
    "There's history.": 1,
    " and somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hordes of neurons.": 1,
    "How is that possible?": 1,
    "Many people just think it isn't possible at all.": 1,
    " No, there can't be any sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness.": 1,
    " This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel.": 1,
    "He's a professor of religion, actually, at the University of Hawaii.": 1,
    "And he's an expert magician and an expert on the street magic of India, which is what this book is about, net of magic.": 1,
    " And there's a passage in it which I would love to share with you.": 1,
    "It speaks so eloquently to the problem.": 1,
    " I'm writing a book on magic.": 1,
    "I explain, and I'm asked, real magic?": 1,
    "By real magic, people mean miracles, thaumaturgical acts, and supernatural powers.": 1,
    "No, I answer, conjuring tricks, not real magic.": 1,
    " Real magic, in other words, refers to the magic that's not real.": 1,
    "While the magic that's real, that can actually be done, is not real magic.": 1,
    " Now, that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness.": 1,
    " Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks.": 1,
    "If you can explain this as a bag of tricks, then it's not real consciousness, whatever it is.": 1,
    " And since, as Marvin said and as other people have said, consciousness is a bag of tricks.": 1,
    "This means that a lot of people are just left": 1,
    " completely dissatisfied and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness.": 1,
    "So this is the problem and so I have to sort of try to, I have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won't like.": 1,
    " for the same reason that you don't like to see a magic trick explained to you.": 1,
    "How many of you here": 1,
    " If somebody, some smart aleck starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done, you sort of want to block your ears.": 1,
    "You say, no, no.": 1,
    "I don't want to know.": 1,
    "Don't take the thrill of it away.": 1,
    "I'd rather be mystified.": 1,
    "Don't tell me the answer.": 1,
    " A lot of people feel that way about consciousness, I've discovered.": 1,
    "And I'm sorry if I impose some clarity, some understanding on you.": 1,
    "You better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks.": 1,
    " But I'm not going to explain it all to you.": 1,
    " I'm gonna do what philosophers do.": 1,
    " Here's how a philosopher explains the sawing the lady in half trick.": 1,
    "You know the sawing the lady in half trick?": 1,
    "The philosopher says, I'm going to explain to you how that's done.": 1,
    " You see?": 1,
    " The magician doesn't really saw the lady in half.": 1,
    " He merely makes you think that he does.": 1,
    "And you say, Jan, how does he do that?": 1,
    "He says, oh, that's not my department.": 1,
    "I'm sorry.": 1,
    " So now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness, but I'm going to try to also show you that consciousness isn't quite as marvelous.": 1,
    "Your own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful as you may have thought it is.": 1,
    " This is something by the way that Lee Siegel talks about in his book.": 1,
    "He marvels at how": 1,
    " He'll do a magic show, and afterwards people will swear they saw him do X, Y, and Z. He never did those things.": 1,
    "He didn't even try to do those things.": 1,
    "People's memories inflate what they think they saw.": 1,
    "And the same is true of consciousness.": 1,
    " Now let's see if this will work.": 1,
    " Alright, let's just watch this.": 1,
    " Watch it carefully.": 1,
    " I'm working with a young computer animator, documentarian named Nick Diemer.": 1,
    "And this is a little demo that he's done for me.": 1,
    "Part of a larger project some of you may be interested in.": 1,
    "We're looking for a backer.": 1,
    " It's a feature-length documentary on consciousness.": 1,
    " Okay, now you all saw what changed, right?": 1,
    " How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color?": 1,
    " everyone.": 1,
    "I'll just show you by running it again.": 1,
    " Even when you know that they're all going to change color.": 1,
    " It's very hard to notice.": 1,
    "You have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all.": 1,
    " Now, this is an example, one of many, of a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit.": 1,
    "It's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my book, 1991 book, Consciousness Explained.": 1,
    " where I said, if you did experiments of this sort, you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes.": 1,
    "I'll show you if there's time at the end, I'll show you a much more dramatic case.": 1,
    " Now, how can it be that there's all those changes going on and that we're not aware of them?": 1,
    " Earlier today, Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades, the way your eye moves around three or four times a second.": 1,
    " He didn't mention the speed.": 1,
    "Your eye is constantly in motion, moving around, looking at eyes, nose, elbows, looking at interesting things in the world.": 1,
    "And where your eye isn't looking, you're remarkably": 1,
    " impoverished in your vision.": 1,
    "That's because the foveal part of your eye, which is the high resolution part, is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arm's length.": 1,
    "That's the detailed part.": 1,
    "All the rest of your vision, it doesn't seem that way, does it?": 1,
    " It doesn't seem that way, but that's the way it is.": 1,
    "You're getting a lot less information than you think.": 1,
    " Here's a completely different effect.": 1,
    "This is a painting by Bellotto.": 1,
    " It's in a museum in North Carolina.": 1,
    "Bellotto was a student of Canaletto's.": 1,
    "And I love paintings like that.": 1,
    "The painting is actually about as big as it is right here.": 1,
    " And I love Canalettos because Canaletto has this fantastic detail and you can get right up, you know, really just get right up and see all the details on the painting.": 1,
    "And I started across the hall.": 1,
    " in North Carolina, because I thought it was probably a Canaletto and would have all that in detail.": 1,
    "And I noticed that the bridge there, there's a lot of people.": 1,
    "You can just barely see them walking across the bridge.": 1,
    " And I thought as I got closer, I would be able to see all the detail on those people and see their clothes and so forth.": 1,
    "And as I got closer and closer, I actually screamed.": 1,
    "I yelled out because when I got close, I found the detail wasn't there at all.": 1,
    " It was just little artfully placed blobs of paint.": 1,
    " And as I walk towards the picture...": 1,
    " I was expecting detail that wasn't there.": 1,
    "The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes and wagons and all sorts of things, and my brain had taken the suggestion.": 1,
    " You're familiar with a more recent technology, which is there.": 1,
    "You can get a better view of the blobs.": 1,
    "See, they're really, when you get close, they're really just blobs of paint.": 1,
    " And you will have seen something like this.": 1,
    " So this is the reverse effect.": 1,
    " Just give that to you one more time.": 1,
    " Now, what does your brain do": 1,
    " when it takes a suggestion.": 1,
    "When an artful blob of paint or two by an artist": 1,
    " suggests a person, say, does some of Marvin Minsky's little society of minds, do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere?": 1,
    "I don't think so.": 1,
    " Not a chance.": 1,
    "But then how on earth is it done?": 1,
    "Well,": 1,
    " Remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady?": 1,
    "It's the same thing.": 1,
    "The brain just makes you think.": 1,
    " that it's got the detail there.": 1,
    "You think the detail's there, but it isn't there.": 1,
    "The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all, it's just making you expect the detail.": 1,
    " Let's just do this experiment very quickly.": 1,
    "Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right rotated?": 1,
    " Yes.": 1,
    "How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind's eye to see if it matched up with the one on the right?": 1,
    "How many of you rotated the one on the right?": 1,
    "Okay.": 1,
    "How do you know that's what you did?": 1,
    " There's in fact been a very interesting debate raging for over 20 years in cognitive science, various experiments started by Roger Shepard, who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images.": 1,
    " Yes, it's possible to do that, but the details of the process is still in significant controversy.": 1,
    "And if you read that literature, one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is": 1,
    " Even when you're the subject in the experiment, you don't know.": 1,
    "You don't know how you do it.": 1,
    "You just know that you have certain beliefs.": 1,
    " And they come in a certain order at a certain time.": 1,
    "And what explains the fact that that's what you think?": 1,
    "Well, that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician.": 1,
    " This is a figure that I love, Bradley Petrie and Dumas.": 1,
    "You may think that I've cheated, that I've put a little": 1,
    " whiter than white boundary there.": 1,
    "How many of you see that sort of boundary with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles?": 1,
    "Can you see it?": 1,
    " Well, you know, in effect, the boundary is really there.": 1,
    " in a certain sense.": 1,
    "Your brain is actually computing that boundary, the boundary that goes right there, the boundary that's going right there.": 1,
    "But now, notice there's two ways of seeing the cube, right?": 1,
    "It's a Necker cube.": 1,
    "Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube?": 1,
    " Okay, can you see the four ways of seeing the cube?": 1,
    " Because there's another way of seeing it.": 1,
    "If you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles, some black circles, there's another way of seeing it.": 1,
    "As a cube on a black background is seen through a piece of Swiss cheese.": 1,
    " Can you get it?": 1,
    " How many of you can't get it?": 1,
    " That'll help.": 1,
    " Nah, you can get it.": 1,
    " These are two very different phenomena.": 1,
    "When you see the cube one way, behind the screen,": 1,
    " Those boundaries go away.": 1,
    " But there's still a sort of filling in as we can tell if we look at this.": 1,
    " We don't have any trouble seeing the cube, but where does the color change?": 1,
    " Does your brain have to send little painters in there and the purple painters and the green painters fight over who's gonna paint that bit behind the curtain?": 1,
    "No, your brain just lets it go.": 1,
    "Brain doesn't need to fill that in.": 1,
    " Haha.": 1,
    " When I first started talking about the Bradley Petrie, do my example that you just saw.": 1,
    "I'll go back to it.": 1,
    " This one.": 1,
    "I said.": 1,
    " that there was no filling in behind there.": 1,
    "And I suppose that that was just a flat truth always true.": 1,
    "But Rob Van Leer has recently shown that it isn't.": 1,
    " Now, if you think you see some pale yellow": 1,
    " I'll run this a few more times.": 1,
    "Look in the gray areas.": 1,
    "Look in these gray areas and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there.": 1,
    " Yeah.": 1,
    " Yeah, it's amazing.": 1,
    "There's nothing there and no trick there.": 1,
    " This is Ron Rensink's work, which was in some degree inspired by that suggestion of mine at the end of the book.": 1,
    "Let me just pause this for a second if I can.": 1,
    "This is change blindness.": 1,
    "What you're going to see is two pictures.": 1,
    " One of which is slightly different from the other, as you see here, the red roof and the gray roof.": 1,
    "And in between them, there will be a mask, which is just a blank screen, for about a quarter of a second.": 1,
    "So you'll see the first picture, then a mask, and the second picture, then a mask.": 1,
    " And this will just continue.": 1,
    " And your job as a subject is to press the button when you see the change.": 1,
    "So, show the original picture for 240 milliseconds.": 1,
    " blank.": 1,
    "Show the next picture for 240 milliseconds.": 1,
    " blank, and keep going until the subject presses the button saying, I see the change.": 1,
    "So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment.": 1,
    " We're going to start easy.": 1,
    " Some examples.": 1,
    " No trouble there, huh?": 1,
    "Can everybody see?": 1,
    " All right.": 1,
    "And indeed.": 1,
    " Rensink subjects took only a little bit more than a second to press the button.": 1,
    " See that one?": 1,
    " I'm sorry.": 1,
    " 2.9 seconds.": 1,
    " How many don't see it still?": 1,
    " What's on the roof of that barn?": 1,
    " That's easy.": 1,
    " Is it a bridge or a dock?": 1,
    " There's a few more really dramatic ones, and then I'll close.": 1,
    "I want you to see a few that are particularly striking.": 1,
    "This one, because it's so large.": 1,
    " And yet it's pretty hard to see.": 1,
    " Let's see it.": 1,
    " See the shadows going back and forth?": 1,
    "Pretty big.": 1,
    " So 15 and a half seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment.": 1,
    "I love this one.": 1,
    "I'll end with this one.": 1,
    "Just because it's such an obvious and important thing.": 1,
    "How many engines on the wing of that Boeing?": 1,
    " right in the middle of the picture.": 1,
    " Okay.": 1,
    "Thanks very much for your attention.": 1,
    "What I wanted to show you is that scientists using their from the outside third-person methods can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of.": 1,
    " And that in fact, you are not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are.": 1,
    "And we're really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind.": 1,
    "Jeff Hawkins this morning was": 1,
    " describing his attempt to get theory and a good big theory into the neuroscience.": 1,
    "And he's right.": 1,
    "This is a problem.": 1,
    " At Harvard Medical School once, I was at a talk.": 1,
    "The director of the lab said, in our lab, we have a saying.": 1,
    "If you work on one neuron, that's neuroscience.": 1,
    "If you work on two neurons, that's psychology.": 1,
    " We have to have more theory and it can come as much from the top down.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
