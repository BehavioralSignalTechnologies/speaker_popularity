    " This is the exact moment that I started creating something called Tinkering School.": 1,
    " Tinkering school is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects and be trusted.": 1,
    "Trusted not to hurt themselves and trusted not to hurt others.": 1,
    " Tinkering school doesn't follow a set curriculum and there are no tests.": 1,
    "We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing.": 1,
    " When the kids arrive, they're confronted with lots of stuff, wood and nails and rope and wheels and lots of tools, real tools.": 1,
    " It's a six-day immersive experience for the kids.": 1,
    "And within that context, we can offer the kids time, something that seems in short supply in their over-scheduled lives.": 1,
    " Our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived.": 1,
    " and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around.": 1,
    " Nothing ever turns out as planned.": 1,
    " ever.": 1,
    " And the kids soon learn that all projects go awry.": 1,
    " and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success": 1,
    " or gleeful calamity.": 1,
    " We start from doodles and sketches.": 1,
    " And sometimes we make real plans, and sometimes we just start building.": 1,
    " Building is at the heart of the experience.": 1,
    " hands-on, deeply immersed, and fully committed to the problem at hand.": 1,
    " Robin and I, acting as collaborators, keep the landscape of the projects tilted towards completion.": 1,
    " Success is in the doing, and failures are celebrated and analyzed.": 1,
    " Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear.": 1,
    " When faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities, a really interesting behavior emerges.": 1,
    " Decoration.": 1,
    " Decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation.": 1,
    " From these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before.": 1,
    " all materials.": 1,
    " are available for use.": 1,
    "Even those mundane, hateful plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined.": 1,
    " and the things that they build.": 1,
    " amaze even themselves.": 1,
    " Three, two, one, go!": 1,
    " a roller coaster built by seven year olds.": 1,
    " No!": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    "It's been a great pleasure.": 1
