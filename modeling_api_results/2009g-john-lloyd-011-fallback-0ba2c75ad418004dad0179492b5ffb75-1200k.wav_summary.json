    "They don't.": 2,
    " So, the question is, what is invisible?": 1,
    "There's more of it than you think, actually.": 1,
    "Everything, I would say, everything that matters, except everything, and except matter.": 1,
    " We can see matter, but we can't see what's the matter.": 1,
    "As in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently.": 1,
    " The marriage suffered a setback in 1965 when the husband was killed by the wife.": 1,
    " There's a world of invisibility there, isn't there?": 1,
    " So we can see the stars and the planets, but we can't see what holds them apart or what draws them together.": 1,
    "With matter, as with people, we see only the skin of things.": 1,
    "We can't see into the engine room.": 1,
    "We can't see what makes people tick.": 1,
    " at least not without difficulty, and the closer we look at anything, the more it disappears.": 1,
    "In fact, if you look really closely at stuff, you look at the basic substructure of matter,": 1,
    " There isn't anything there.": 1,
    "Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz and there is only energy.": 1,
    "You can't see energy.": 1,
    " So everything that matters, that's important, is invisible.": 1,
    "One slightly silly thing that's invisible is this story, which is invisible to you, and I'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds.": 1,
    " It's about an MP called Geoffrey Dickens.": 1,
    "The late Geoffrey Dickens MP was attending a fate in his constituency.": 1,
    "Wherever he went, at every stall he stopped, he was closely followed by a devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness.": 1,
    " Try as he might, he couldn't get away from her.": 1,
    "A few days later, he received a letter from a constituent saying how much she admired him, had met him at a fate, and asking for a signed photograph.": 1,
    "After her name, written in brackets, was the apt description, horse face.": 1,
    " I've misjudged this woman, thought Mr Dickens.": 1,
    "Not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness, she turns it to her advantage.": 1,
    "A photo is not enough.": 1,
    " So he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in, and on the photograph he wrote with a flourish, to Horseface, with love from Jeffrey Dickens, MP.": 1,
    " After it had been sent off, his secretary said to him, did you get that letter from the woman at the fate?": 1,
    "I wrote horse face on her so you remember who she was.": 1,
    " I bet he thought he wished he was invisible, don't you?": 1,
    " So one of the interesting things about invisibility is the things that we can't see, we also can't understand.": 1,
    "Gravity is one thing that we can't see and which we don't understand.": 1,
    "It's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces and the weakest.": 1,
    " And nobody really knows what it is or why it's there.": 1,
    "For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton, the greatest scientist who ever lived, he thought Jesus came to earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity.": 1,
    "That's what he thought he was there for.": 1,
    " So, bright guy.": 1,
    "Could be wrong on that one, I don't know.": 1,
    " Consciousness.": 1,
    "I see all your faces.": 1,
    "I have no idea what any of you are thinking.": 1,
    "Isn't that amazing?": 1,
    "Isn't it incredible that we can't read each other's minds when we can touch each other?": 1,
    " taste each other, perhaps, if we get close enough.": 1,
    "But we can't read each other's minds.": 1,
    "I find that quite astonishing.": 1,
    "In the Sufi faith, this great Middle Eastern religion, which some claim is the root of all religions, Sufi masters are all telepaths.": 1,
    " so they say, but their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist.": 1,
    " So that's why we don't think it's this, the Sufi masters working on us.": 1,
    "In the question of consciousness and artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence is really like the study of consciousness, it's got nowhere, we have no idea how consciousness works.": 1,
    " With artificial intelligence, not only have they not created artificial intelligence, they haven't yet created artificial stupidity.": 1,
    " The laws of physics, invisible, eternal, omnipresent, all powerful.": 1,
    "Remind you of anyone?": 1,
    "Interesting.": 1,
    " I'm, as you can guess, not a materialist, I'm an immaterialist, and I've found a very useful new word, agnostic, okay?": 1,
    "I'm an agnostic.": 1,
    "I refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists until somebody properly defines the terms.": 1,
    " Another thing we can't see is the human genome and this is increasingly peculiar because": 1,
    " About 20 years ago, when they started delving into the genome, they thought it would probably contain around 100,000 genes.": 1,
    "Geneticists will know this, but every year since, it's been revised downwards.": 1,
    " We now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000 genes in the human genome.": 1,
    "This is extraordinary because rice, get this, rice is known to have 38,000 genes.": 1,
    " Potatoes have 48 chromosomes.": 1,
    "Do you know that?": 1,
    "Two more than people.": 1,
    "And the same as a gorilla.": 1,
    " You can't see these things, but they are very strange.": 1,
    " The stars by day always think that's fascinating.": 1,
    "The universe disappears.": 1,
    "The more light there is, the less you can see.": 1,
    " Time.": 1,
    "Nobody can see time.": 1,
    "I don't know if you know this, modern physics is a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist because it's too inconvenient for the figures.": 1,
    "It's much easier if it's not really there.": 1,
    "You can't see the future.": 1,
    " obviously, and you can't see the past except in your memory.": 1,
    "One of the interesting things about the past is you particularly can't see.": 1,
    "My son asked me this the other day, said, Dad, can you remember what I was like when I was two?": 1,
    "And I said, yes.": 1,
    "He said, why can't I?": 1,
    " Isn't that extraordinary?": 1,
    "You cannot remember what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three.": 1,
    "Which is great news for psychoanalysts, because otherwise they'd be out of a job, because that's where all the stuff happens.": 1,
    " that makes you who you are.": 1,
    " Another thing you can't see is the grid on which we hang.": 1,
    "This is fascinating.": 1,
    "You probably know some of you that cells are continually renewed.": 1,
    "You can see it in skin and this kind of stuff.": 1,
    "Skin flakes off.": 1,
    " Hairs grow, nails, that kind of stuff, but every cell in your body is replaced at some point.": 1,
    "Taste buds every ten days or so.": 1,
    "Livers and internal organs take a bit longer, spine takes several years, but at the end of seven years, not one cell in your body": 1,
    " remains from what was there seven years ago.": 1,
    "The question is, who then are we?": 1,
    "What are we?": 1,
    "What is this thing that we hang on that is actually us?": 1,
    " Okay, atoms, can't see them, nobody ever will, smaller than the wavelength of light.": 1,
    "Gas, can't see that, interesting, somebody mentioned 1600 recently.": 1,
    "Gas was invented in 1600 by a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont.": 1,
    " And it's said to be the most successful ever invention of a word by a known individual.": 1,
    "Quite good.": 1,
    "He also invented a word called blast.": 1,
    " meaning astral radiation didn't catch on, unfortunately.": 1,
    "But well done, him.": 1,
    "There's so many things that... Light.": 1,
    " You can't see light.": 1,
    "When it's dark in a vacuum, if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes, you won't see it.": 1,
    "It's slightly technical, some physicists will disagree with this, but it's odd that you can't see the beam of light, you can only see what it hits.": 1,
    " I find that extraordinary, not to be able to see light, not to be able to see darkness.": 1,
    "Electricity, you can't see that.": 1,
    "Don't let anyone tell you they understand electricity.": 1,
    "Nobody knows what it is.": 1,
    " You probably think the electrons in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire, don't you, at the speed of light, when you turn the light on?": 1,
    "Electrons bumble down the wire, about the speed of spreading honey, they say.": 1,
    " Galaxies, 100 billion of them estimating the universe.": 1,
    "100 billion.": 1,
    "How many can we see?": 1,
    "Five.": 1,
    "Five out of the 100 billion galaxies with the naked eye.": 1,
    "And one of them's quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight.": 1,
    " radio waves.": 1,
    "There's another thing.": 1,
    "Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered radio waves in 1887, he called them radio waves because they radiated.": 1,
    " Somebody said to him, what's the point of these Heinrich?": 1,
    "What's the point of these radio waves that you've found?": 1,
    "And he said, well, I've no idea, but I guess somebody will find a use for them someday.": 1,
    "And that's what they do, radio.": 1,
    "That's what they discovered.": 1,
    " Anyway, so the biggest thing that's invisible to us is what we don't know.": 1,
    "It is incredible how little we know.": 1,
    "Thomas Edison once said, we don't know 1% of one millionth about anything.": 1,
    " And I've come to the conclusion...": 1,
    " Because you asked this other question, what's another thing we can't see?": 1,
    "The point, most of us.": 1,
    "What's the point?": 1,
    " You can't see a point, it's by definition dimensionless, like an electron, oddly enough.": 1,
    "But the point, what I've got it down to is there are only two questions really worth asking.": 1,
    "Why are we here?": 1,
    "And what should we do about it while we are?": 1,
    " And to help you, I've got two things to leave you with from two great philosophers, perhaps two of the greatest philosopher-thinkers of the 20th century, one a mathematician and an engineer and the other a poet.": 1,
    "The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein.": 1,
    " who said, I don't know why we are here, but I'm pretty sure it's not in order to enjoy ourselves.": 1,
    " He was a cheerful bastard wasn't he?": 1,
    " And secondly and lastly, WH Jordan, one of my favourite poets, who said, we are here on earth to help others.": 1,
    "What the others are here for, I've no idea.": 1
