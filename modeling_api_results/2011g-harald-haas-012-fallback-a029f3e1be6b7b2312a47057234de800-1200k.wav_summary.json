    " Do you know that we have 1.4 million cellular radio masts deployed worldwide?": 1,
    "And these are base stations.": 1,
    "And we also have": 1,
    " More than five billions of these devices here, these are cellular mobile phones.": 1,
    " And with these mobile phones, we transmit more than 600 terabytes of data every month.": 1,
    "This is a 6 with 14 zeros, a very large number.": 1,
    " And wireless communications has become a utility like electricity and water.": 1,
    "We use it every day.": 1,
    "We use it in our everyday life, in our private lives, in our business lives.": 1,
    " And we even have to be asked sometimes very kindly to switch off the mobile phone at events like this for good reasons.": 1,
    " It is this importance that why I decided to look into the issues that this technology has, because it's so fundamental to our lives.": 1,
    "And one of the issues is capacity.": 1,
    " The way we transmit wireless data is using electromagnetic waves, in particular radio waves.": 1,
    "And radio waves are limited, they are scarce, they are expensive, and we only have a certain range of it.": 1,
    " It is this limitation that doesn't cope with the demand of wireless data transmission, the number of bytes and data we transmit every month, and we are simply running out of spectrum.": 1,
    " There's another problem, that is efficiency.": 1,
    "These 1.4 million cellular radio masts or base stations consume a lot of energy.": 1,
    " And mind you, most of the energy is not used to transmit the radio waves, it is used to cool the base stations.": 1,
    "And the efficiency of such a base station is only at about 5%.": 1,
    "Availability is a big problem.": 1,
    " Then there's another issue that you're all aware of.": 1,
    "You have to switch off your mobile phones during flights.": 1,
    "In hospitals, there are security issues.": 1,
    " And security is another issue.": 1,
    "These radio waves penetrate through walls.": 1,
    "They can be intercepted and somebody can make use of your network if he has bad intentions.": 1,
    " So these are the main four issues.": 1,
    "But on the other hand, we have 14 billion of these light bulbs.": 1,
    " Light.": 1,
    "And light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum.": 1,
    "So let's look at this in the context of the entire electromagnetic spectrum, where we have gamma rays.": 1,
    "You don't want to get close to gamma rays, simply dangerous.": 1,
    "X-rays, useful when you go to hospitals.": 1,
    " Then there's ultraviolet light.": 1,
    "It's good for nice sun tan, but otherwise dangerous for the human body.": 1,
    "Infrared due to high safety regulations can be only used with low powers.": 1,
    "And then we have the radio waves, the issues I've just mentioned.": 1,
    " And in the middle there, we have this visible light spectrum.": 1,
    "It's light.": 1,
    "And light has been around for many millions of years.": 1,
    " And in fact, it has created us, it has created life, it has created all the stuff of life.": 1,
    "So it's inherently safe to use.": 1,
    "It wouldn't be great to use that for wireless communications.": 1,
    " Not only that, I compared the entire spectrum.": 1,
    "I compared the radio waves spectrum, the size of it, with the size of the visible light spectrum.": 1,
    "And guess what?": 1,
    " We have 10,000 times more of that spectrum which is there for us to use": 1,
    " So not only that we have this huge amount of spectrum, let's compare that with the number I've just mentioned.": 1,
    "We have 1.4 million expensively deployed inefficient radio cellular base stations.": 1,
    " and multiply that by 10,000, then you end up at 14 billion.": 1,
    "And 14 billion are the number of light bulbs installed already.": 1,
    " So we have the infrastructure there.": 1,
    "Look at the ceiling.": 1,
    "You see all these light bulbs.": 1,
    "Go to the main floor.": 1,
    "You see these light bulbs.": 1,
    "Can we use them for communications?": 1,
    "And yes.": 1,
    " What do we need to do?": 1,
    "And there's one thing we need to do is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs.": 1,
    " fluorescent lights by this new technology of LED, LED light bulbs.": 1,
    "An LED is a semiconductor, it's an electronic device.": 1,
    "It has a very, very nice and cute property.": 1,
    " its intensity can be modulated at very high speeds and it can be switched off at very high speeds.": 1,
    " And this is a fundamental basic property that we exploit with our technology.": 1,
    "So let's show how we do that.": 1,
    "Let's go to the closest neighbor to the visible light spectrum, go to remote controls.": 1,
    " You all know the remote controls have an infrared LED.": 1,
    "Basically, you switch on the LED, and when it's off, you switch it off, and it creates a simple low-speed data stream in 10,000 bits per second, 20,000 bits per second, not usable for YouTube video.": 1,
    " What we have done is we have developed a technology with which we can, first of all, replace the remote control by light bulb.": 1,
    "We transmit with our technology not only a single data stream, we transmit": 1,
    " thousands of data streams in parallel at even higher speeds.": 1,
    " And the technology we have developed, it's called SIM OFDM and spatial modulation.": 1,
    "These are the only technical terms.": 1,
    "I'm not going into details, but this is how we enabled that light source to transmit data.": 1,
    " You will say, okay, it's nice, it's a slide created in ten minutes, but not only that.": 1,
    " What we've done is we have also developed a demonstrator, and I'm showing for the first time in public this visiblite demonstrator.": 1,
    " And what we have here is an ordinary desk lamp.": 1,
    "We fitted in an LED light bulb worth three US dollar.": 1,
    " put in our signal processing technology.": 1,
    "And then what we have here is a little hole, and the light goes through that hole.": 1,
    "There's a receiver.": 1,
    " The receiver will convert these little subtle changes in the amplitude that we create there into an electrical signal.": 1,
    "And the signal is then converted back to a high-speed data stream.": 1,
    " In the future, we hope that we can integrate this little hole into these smartphones and not only integrate a photo detector here, but maybe use the camera inside.": 1,
    " So what happens when I switch on that light?": 1,
    " As you would expect, it's a light, a desk lamp.": 1,
    "You could put your book beneath and you could read.": 1,
    "It's illuminating the space.": 1,
    "But at the same time, you see this video coming up here.": 1,
    " And this is a video, high definition video that is transmitted through that light beam.": 1,
    "You're all critical.": 1,
    "You say, ha ha ha, this is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here.": 1,
    "But let me do this.": 1,
    " Once again.": 1,
    " See you on belief.": 1,
    " It is this light that transmits this high definition video, this pit stream.": 1,
    " And if you look at the light, it is illuminating as you would expect.": 1,
    "You don't notice with your human eye, you don't notice the subtle changes in the amplitude that we impress onto this light bulb.": 1,
    " It's serving the purpose of illumination, but at the same time, we are able to transmit this data.": 1,
    "You see even light from the ceiling comes down here into the receiver.": 1,
    "It can ignore that.": 1,
    " Constant light because all this the receiver is interested in any subtle changes": 1,
    " You also have critical question now and say, okay, do I have to have the light on all the time to have this working?": 1,
    "And the answer is yes.": 1,
    " You can dim down the light to a level that it appears to be off.": 1,
    "And you'll see label transmit data.": 1,
    "That's possible.": 1,
    " So I've mentioned to you the four challenges.": 1,
    "Capacity.": 1,
    " We have 10,000 times more spectrum, 10,000 times more LEDs installed already, infrastructure there.": 1,
    "You would agree with me, hopefully, there's no issue of capacity anymore.": 1,
    " Efficiency this is data through illumination first of all an illumination device, and if you do the the energy budget": 1,
    " The data transmission comes for free.": 1,
    "Highly energy efficient.": 1,
    "I don't mention the high energy efficiency of these LED light bulbs.": 1,
    "If the whole world would deploy them, you would save hundreds of power plants.": 1,
    " That's a side.": 1,
    "And then I've mentioned the availability.": 1,
    "You will agree with me that you have lights in a hospital.": 1,
    "You need to see what to do.": 1,
    "You have lights in an aircraft.": 1,
    " So it's everywhere where there is light.": 1,
    "Look around everywhere.": 1,
    "Look at your smartphone.": 1,
    "It has a flashlight, an LED flashlight.": 1,
    "These are potential sources for high-speed data transmission.": 1,
    "And then there's day security.": 1,
    " you would agree with me that light doesn't penetrate through walls.": 1,
    " So no one, if I have a light here, I have secure data, no one on the other side of this room through that wall would be able to read that data.": 1,
    "And there's only data where there is light.": 1,
    " So if I don't want that receiver to receive the data, then what I could do?": 1,
    " Turn it away.": 1,
    " So the data goes in that direction, not there anymore.": 1,
    "Now, in fact, see where the data is going to.": 1,
    " So for me, the applications of it, to me, are beyond imagination at the moment.": 1,
    " We have had a century of very nice smart application developers.": 1,
    "And you only have to notice where we have light, there is a potential way to transmit data.": 1,
    " But I can give you a few examples where you may see the impact already now.": 1,
    "This is a remote operated vehicles beneath the oceans.": 1,
    " and they use light to illuminate the space down there.": 1,
    "And this light can be used to transmit wireless data that these things communicate with each other.": 1,
    " Environments like this petrochemical plant.": 1,
    "You can't use RF.": 1,
    "It might generate antenna sparks, but you can use light.": 1,
    "You see plenty of light there.": 1,
    "In hospitals for new medical instruments.": 1,
    " in streets for traffic control.": 1,
    "Cars have LED-based headlights, LED-based backlights, and cars can communicate with each other and prevent accidents.": 1,
    " in a way that they exchange information and traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on.": 1,
    "And then you have these millions of street lamps.": 1,
    " deployed around the world, and every street lamp could be a free access point.": 1,
    "We call it, in fact, Li-Fi, light fidelity.": 1,
    " And then we have these aircraft cabins.": 1,
    " There are hundreds of lights in an aircraft cabin.": 1,
    " And each of these lights could be the potential transmitter of wireless data.": 1,
    "So you could enjoy your most favorite TED video on your local flight back home, online life.": 1,
    "So that is a vision that I think is possible.": 1,
    " So all what we need to do is to fit a small microchip to every potential illumination device.": 1,
    " And this would then combine two basic functionalities, illumination and wireless data transmission.": 1,
    "And this symbiosis that I would personally believe could solve the four essential problems that faces us in wireless communication these days.": 1,
    " And in the future, you will not only have 14 billion light bulbs, you may have 14 billion live files deployed worldwide for a cleaner, a greener, and even a brighter future.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
