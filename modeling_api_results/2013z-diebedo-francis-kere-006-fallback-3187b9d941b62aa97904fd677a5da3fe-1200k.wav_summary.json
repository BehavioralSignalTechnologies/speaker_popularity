    " I would like to show you how architecture has helped to change the life of my community and have open opportunities to hope.": 1,
    " I am a native of Burkina Faso.": 1,
    " According to the World Bank, Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world.": 1,
    "But what does it look like to grow up in a place like that?": 1,
    " I am an example of that.": 1,
    "I was born in a little village called Gando.": 1,
    "In Gando, there was no electricity.": 1,
    " no access to clean drinking water and no school.": 1,
    "But my father wanted me to learn how to read and write.": 1,
    "For this reason,": 1,
    " I have to leave my family when I was seven and to stay in a city far away from my village with no contact to my family.": 1,
    " In this place I sat.": 1,
    " in a class like that with more than 150 other kids and for six years.": 1,
    " And this time, it just happened to me to come to school to realize that my classmate was dying.": 1,
    " Today, not so much has changed.": 1,
    " There is still no electricity in my village.": 1,
    "People still die in Burkina Faso.": 1,
    "And access to clean drinking water is still a big problem.": 1,
    " Bye.": 1,
    " had a luck.": 1,
    "I was lucky because this is fact of life when you grow up in a place like that.": 1,
    "But I was lucky.": 1,
    " I had a scholarship.": 1,
    "I could go to Germany to study.": 1,
    " So now...": 1,
    " I suppose I don't need to explain to you how great a privilege it is for me to be standing before you today from Gando, my home village in Burkina Faso.": 1,
    " to Berlin in Germany to become an architect is a big, big step.": 1,
    " So, but what to do with this privilege?": 1,
    " Since as a student, I wanted to open up better opportunities to other kids in Ghana.": 1,
    "I just wanted to use my skills and build a school.": 1,
    "But how do you do when you steal a student and you don't have money?": 1,
    " Oh yes, I started to make drawings and ask for money.": 1,
    "Fundraising was not an easy task.": 1,
    " I even asked my classmate to spend less money on coffee and cigarettes, but to sponsor my school project.": 1,
    " You will wonder, two years later, I was able to collect 50,000 US dollars.": 1,
    " When I came home to Gando, to bring the good news, my people was over the moon.": 1,
    " But when they realized that I was planning to use clay, they were shocked.": 1,
    "A clay building is not able to stay in the rainy season.": 1,
    "And Francis wanted us to use it and build a school.": 1,
    " Is this the reason why he spends so much time in Europe studying instead of working on the field with us?": 1,
    " My people build all the time with clay.": 1,
    " but they don't see any innovation with man.": 1,
    "So I had to convince everybody.": 1,
    "I started to speak with the community and I could convince everybody and we could start to work.": 1,
    " and the women, the men.": 1,
    "Everybody from the village past was part of this building process.": 1,
    "I was allowed to use even traditional techniques.": 1,
    "So clay floor, for example.": 1,
    " The young man comes and stand like that, beating.": 1,
    " Hours for hours, and then their murder came.": 1,
    "And that bit in this position.": 1,
    " for hours, giving water.": 1,
    " even water and beating and then the polisher cap they start polishing it with a stone for hours.": 1,
    " And then you have this result.": 1,
    " Very fine, like a baby button.": 1,
    "It's now Photoshop.": 1,
    " This is the school built with the community.": 1,
    "The walls are totally made out of compressive clay blocks from Gandu.": 1,
    " The roof structure is made with cheap steel bars normally hidden inside concrete.": 1,
    " In the classroom, the ceiling is made out of both of them used together.": 1,
    "In this school, there was a simple idea.": 1,
    " to create comfort in the classroom.": 1,
    "Don't forget, it can be 45 degrees in Burkina Faso.": 1,
    " So with simple ventilation, I wanted to make the classroom good for teaching and learning.": 1,
    "And this is the project today.": 1,
    " 12 years old, still in best condition.": 1,
    "And the kids, they love it.": 1,
    " For me and my community, this project was a huge success.": 1,
    "It has opened up opportunities to do more projects in Ghana.": 1,
    " So I could do a lot of projects and here I'm going to share with you only three of them.": 1,
    "But the first one is the school extension, of course.": 1,
    "How do you explain drawings and engineering?": 1,
    " to people who are neither able to read nor write.": 1,
    "I start to build a prototype, like that.": 1,
    "The innovation was to build a clay vault.": 1,
    "So, and then I jump.": 1,
    " on the top, like that, with my team.": 1,
    "And it works.": 1,
    "The community is looking, it still works.": 1,
    "So we can build.": 1,
    " And we keep building, and that is the result.": 1,
    " The kids are happy and they love it.": 1,
    "The community is very proud.": 1,
    "We made it and even": 1,
    " Animals, like these donkeys, loves our buildings.": 1,
    " The next project is the laboratory in Ghana.": 1,
    " As you know, we try to introduce different ideas in our buildings, but we often don't have so much material.": 1,
    "Something we have in Gando are clay pots.": 1,
    "We wanted to use them.": 1,
    " to create openings.": 1,
    "So we just bring them like you can see to the building site.": 1,
    " We start cutting them and then we place them on the top of the roof before we pour the concrete.": 1,
    " And you have this result.": 1,
    "The openings are letting the hot air out and light in.": 1,
    "Very simple.": 1,
    " My most recent project in Kando is a high school project.": 1,
    "I would like to share with you this.": 1,
    "The innovation in this project is to cast mud, like you would cast concrete.": 1,
    " How do you cast mud?": 1,
    " We start making a lot of models, like you can see, and everything is ready.": 1,
    "When you know what is the best recipe and the best form, you start working with the community.": 1,
    "And sometimes I can leave.": 1,
    " They will do it themselves.": 1,
    "I came to speak to you like that.": 1,
    " Another factor in gandu is rain.": 1,
    "When the rains come, we hurry up to protect our fragile walls against the rain.": 1,
    " Don't conform with Christo and Jean-Claude.": 1,
    "It is simply how we protect our worlds.": 1,
    " The rain in Burkina come very fast.": 1,
    " And after that, you have flawed everywhere in the country.": 1,
    " But for us, the rain is good.": 1,
    "It brings sand and gravel to the river.": 1,
    " we need to use to build.": 1,
    "We just wait the rain to go.": 1,
    "We take the sand, we mix them with clay, and we keep building.": 1,
    " That is it.": 1,
    " The Gando project was always connected to training the people because I just wanted one day, when I fall down and die, that at least one person from Gando keep doing this work.": 1,
    " But you will be surprised.": 1,
    "I'm still alive.": 1,
    " And my people now can use their skills to earn money themselves.": 1,
    " Usually for a young man from Liendo to earn money, you have to leave the country to the city, sometimes leave the country, and some never come back, making the community weaker.": 1,
    " But now they can stay in the country and work on different building sites and earn money to feed their family is a new quality in this work.": 1,
    " Yes, you know it.": 1,
    "I have won a lot of awards through this work.": 1,
    " For sure, it has open opportunities.": 1,
    "I have become myself now.": 1,
    "But the reason why I do what I do is my community.": 1,
    " when I was a kid.": 1,
    " I was going to school, I was coming back every holiday to Uganda.": 1,
    " By the end of every holidays, I have to say goodbye to the community, going from one compound to another one.": 1,
    " All women in Gando will open their clothes like that and give me the last penny.": 1,
    " In my culture, this is a symbol of deep affection.": 1,
    " As a seven years old guy, I was impressed.": 1,
    "I just asked my mother one day, why all these women love me so much?": 1,
    " She just answered, they are contributing to pay for your education, hoping that you will be successful and one day come back.": 1,
    " and help improve the quality of life of the community.": 1,
    "I hope now": 1,
    " that I was able to make my community proud through this work.": 1,
    "And I hope I was able to prove you the power of community and to show you that architecture": 1,
    " Can be.": 1,
    " inspiring for communities to shape their own future.": 1,
    "Merci beaucoup.": 1
