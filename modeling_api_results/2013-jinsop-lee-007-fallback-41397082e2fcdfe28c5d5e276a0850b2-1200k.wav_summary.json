    " In an age of global strife and climate change, I'm here to answer the all-important question.": 1,
    " Why is sex so damn good?": 1,
    "If you're laughing, you know what I mean.": 1,
    "Now, before we get to that answer, let me tell you about Chris Hosmer.": 1,
    "Chris is a great friend of mine from my university days, but secretly, I hate him.": 1,
    " Here's why.": 1,
    "Back in university, we had a quick project to design some solar powered clocks.": 1,
    "Here's my clock.": 1,
    "It uses something called the dwarf sunflower, which grows to about 12 inches in height.": 1,
    "Now, as you know,": 1,
    " Sunflowers track the sun during the course of the day.": 1,
    "So in the morning, you see which direction the sunflower is facing and you mark it on the blank area in the base.": 1,
    " At noon, you mark the change position of the sunflower, and in the evening, again.": 1,
    "And that's your clock.": 1,
    " Now, I know my clock doesn't tell you the exact time, but it does give you a general idea using a flower.": 1,
    "So, my completely unbiased subjective opinion, it's brilliant.": 1,
    "However, here's Chris's clock.": 1,
    " It's five magnifying glasses with a shot glass under each one.": 1,
    "In each shot glass is a different scented oil.": 1,
    "In the morning, the sunlight will shine down on the first magnifying glass, focusing a beam of light on the shot glass underneath.": 1,
    " This will warm up the scented oil inside and a particular smell will be emitted.": 1,
    " A couple of hours later, the sun will shine on the next magnifying glass and a different smell will be emitted.": 1,
    "So during the course of the day, five different smells are dispersed throughout that environment.": 1,
    "Anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell.": 1,
    " You can see why I hate Chris.": 1,
    "I thought my idea was pretty good, but his idea is genius.": 1,
    "And at the time, I knew his idea was better than mine, but I just couldn't explain why.": 1,
    "One thing you have to know about me is I hate to lose.": 1,
    " This problem's been bugging me for well over a decade.": 1,
    " All right, let's get back to the question of why sex is so good.": 1,
    "Many years after the solar powered clocks project, a young lady I knew suggested maybe sex is so good because of the five senses.": 1,
    "And when she said this, I had an epiphany.": 1,
    " So I decided to evaluate different experiences I had in my life from the point of view of the five senses.": 1,
    "To do this, I devised something called the five senses graph.": 1,
    " Along the y-axis, you have a scale from 0 to 10, and along the x-axis, you have, of course, the five senses.": 1,
    "Anytime I had a memorable experience in my life, I would record it on this graph, like a five-senses diary.": 1,
    " Here's a quick video to show you how it works.": 1,
    " Hey, my name is Jindal, and today I'm going to show you what riding motorbikes is like from the point of view of the five senses.": 1,
    "Oi!": 1,
    "This is Dambaugh, custom bike designer.": 1,
    " Haha.": 1,
    " Hello?": 1,
    "Hello?": 1,
    " And that's how the five census graph works.": 1,
    "Now, for a period of three years, I gather data, not just me, but also some of my friends.": 1,
    "And I used to teach in university, so I asked my students to do this as well.": 1,
    " So here are some other results.": 1,
    "The first is, for instance, noodles.": 1,
    "Now, obviously, taste and smell are quite high, but notice sound is at three.": 1,
    " Many people told me a big part of the noodle-eating experience is the slurping noise, you know.": 1,
    "Needless to say, I no longer dine with these people.": 1,
    "Okay, next, clubbing.": 1,
    " Okay, here what I found interesting was that taste is at four and many respondents told me": 1,
    " It's because of the taste of drinks, but also in some cases kissing is a big part of the clubbing experience.": 1,
    "These people I still do hang out with.": 1,
    "And smoking.": 1,
    " Okay, here I found touches at four and one of the reasons is that smokers told me the sensation of holding a cigarette and bring it up to your lips is a big part of the smoking experience, which shows": 1,
    " It's kind of scary to think how well cigarettes are designed by the manufacturers.": 1,
    "Now, what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph?": 1,
    "It would, of course, be a horizontal line along the top.": 1,
    " Now, you can see not even an intense experience as riding a motorbike comes close.": 1,
    "In fact, in the years that I gathered data, only one experience came close to being the perfect one.": 1,
    "That is, of course, sex.": 1,
    " Great sex.": 1,
    "Respondent said that great sex hits all of the five senses at an extreme level.": 1,
    "Here I'll quote one of my students who said, sex is so good, it's good even when it's bad.": 1,
    " So the five census theory does help explain why sex is so good.": 1,
    "Now, in the middle of all this five census work,": 1,
    " I suddenly remembered the solar-powered clocks project from my youth, and I realized this theory also explains why Chris's clock is so much better than mine.": 1,
    "You see, my clock only focuses on sight and a little bit of touch.": 1,
    " Here's Chris' clock.": 1,
    " It's the first clock ever that uses smell to tell the time.": 1,
    "In fact, in terms of the five senses, Chris's clock is a revolution.": 1,
    " And that's what this theory taught me about my field.": 1,
    "You see, up till now, us designers, we've mainly focused on making things look very pretty and a little bit of touch, which means we've ignored the other three senses.": 1,
    " Chris's clock shows us that even raising just one of those other sensors can make for a brilliant product.": 1,
    "So what if we started using the five-sensors theory in all of our designs?": 1,
    "Here's three quick ideas I came up with.": 1,
    " This is an iron, you know, for your clothes, to which I added a spraying mechanism.": 1,
    "So you fill up the vial with your favorite scent and your clothes will smell nicer, but hopefully should also make the ironing experience more enjoyable.": 1,
    " We could call this the perfumator.": 1,
    "All right, next.": 1,
    "So I brush my teeth twice a day.": 1,
    "And what if we had a toothbrush that tastes like candy?": 1,
    " And when the taste of candy ran out, you'd know it's time to change a toothbrush.": 1,
    "Finally, I have a thing for the keys on a flute or a clarinet.": 1,
    " It's not just the way they look, but I love the way they feel when you press down on them.": 1,
    "Now, I don't play the flute or the clarinet, so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play, the television remote control.": 1,
    " Now, when we look at these three ideas together, you'll notice that the five senses theory doesn't only change the way we use these products but also the way they look.": 1,
    " So in conclusion, I found the five senses theory to be a very useful tool in evaluating different experiences in my life and then taking those best experiences and hopefully incorporating them into my designs.": 1,
    " I realize the five senses isn't the only thing that makes life interesting.": 1,
    "There's also the six emotions and that elusive X factor.": 1,
    " Maybe that could be the topic of my next talk.": 1,
    "Until then, please have fun using the five senses in your own lives and your own designs.": 1,
    "Oh, one last thing before I leave.": 1,
    " Here's the experience you all have while listening to the TED Talks.": 1,
    "However, it would be better if we could boost up a couple of the other senses, like smell and taste.": 1,
    "And the best way to do that is with...": 1,
    " free candy.": 1,
    "You guys ready?": 1,
    "Alright.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
