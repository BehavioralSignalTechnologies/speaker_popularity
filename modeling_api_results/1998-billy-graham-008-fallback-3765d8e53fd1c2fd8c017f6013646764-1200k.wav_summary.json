    "Why am I here?": 2,
    " There's a clergyman.": 1,
    " You can imagine how out of place I feel.": 1,
    "I feel like a fish out of water.": 1,
    " or maybe an owl out of the air.": 1,
    " I was preaching in San Jose some time ago and my friend Mark Kwame.": 1,
    " who helped introduce me to this conference.": 1,
    " brought several CEOs and leaders of some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley to have breakfast with me or I with them.": 1,
    " And I was so stimulated.": 1,
    " and it was an eye-opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology.": 1,
    " and science.": 1,
    " I know that we're near the end of this conference, and some of you may be wondering why they have a speaker from the field of religion.": 1,
    " Richard can answer that because he made that decision.": 1,
    "But some years ago I was on an elevator in Philadelphia coming down.": 1,
    "I was to address a conference at a hotel.": 1,
    " And on that elevator, a man said, I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel.": 1,
    "And another man looked in my direction and said, yes, there he is.": 1,
    "He's on this elevator with us.": 1,
    " And this man looked me up and down for about 10 seconds, and he said, my, what an anticlimax.": 1,
    " I hope.": 1,
    " I hope that you won't feel that these few moments with me is an anti-climax after all this tremendous": 1,
    " talks that you've heard and addresses which I intend to listen to every one of them.": 1,
    "But I was": 1,
    " on an airplane in the east some years ago.": 1,
    "And the man sitting across the aisle from me was the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina.": 1,
    "His name was John Belk.": 1,
    "Some of you would probably know him.": 1,
    " and there was a drunk man on there and he got up out of his seat two or three times and he was making everybody upset by what he was trying to do and he was slapping the stewardess and pinching her as she went by.": 1,
    " and everybody was upset with him.": 1,
    " And finally, John Belk said, do you know who's sitting here?": 1,
    " And the man said, no.": 1,
    "He said, it's Billy Graham, the preacher.": 1,
    "He said, you don't say.": 1,
    "And he turned to me and he said, put her there.": 1,
    "He said, your sermons have certainly helped me.": 1,
    " And I suppose that that's true with thousands of people.": 1,
    " I know that as you have been peering into the future, and as we've heard some of it here tonight,": 1,
    " I would like to live in that age and see what is going to be.": 1,
    " but I won't because I'm 80 years old.": 1,
    "This is my 80th year and I know that my time is brief.": 1,
    " I have phlebitis at the moment in both legs.": 1,
    " And that's the reason I had to have a little help in getting up here because I have Parkinson's disease in addition to that and some other problems that I won't talk about.": 1,
    " But this is not the first time that we've had a technological revolution.": 1,
    " We've had others.": 1,

    " He had the favor of God with him.": 1,
    " He was a brilliant poet, philosopher.": 1,
    " writer, soldier with strategies in battle and conflict that people study even today.": 1,
    " but about two centuries before David.": 1,
    " The hip tights.": 1,
    " had discovered the secret of smelting and processing of iron.": 1,
    "And slowly that skill spread, but they wouldn't allow the Israelis to look into it or to have any.": 1,
    " But David changed all of that, and he introduced the Iron Age to Israel.": 1,
    "And the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron.": 1,
    " in which archaeologists have found that in present-day Palestine, there are evidences of that generation.": 1,
    "Now instead of crude tools made of sticks and stones,": 1,
    " Israel now had iron plows and sickles and hoes and military weapons.": 1,
    "And in the course of one generation, Israel was completely changed.": 1,
    " The introduction of iron in some ways had an impact.": 1,
    " a little bit like the microchip has had on our generation.": 1,
    " and": 1,
    " David found that there were many problems that technology could not solve.": 1,
    "There were many problems.": 1,
    " Still left.": 1,
    " And they're still with us.": 1,
    "And you haven't solved them.": 1,
    "And I haven't heard anybody here speak to that.": 1,
    "How do we solve these three problems that I'd like to mention?": 1,

    " We've seen under the sea, or three miles down, or galaxies hundreds of billions of years out in the future.": 1,
    "But on the other hand,": 1,
    " Something is wrong.": 1,
    " Our battleships, our soldiers are on a frontier now almost ready to go to war with Iraq.": 1,
    "Now what causes this?": 1,
    " Why do we have these wars in every generation and in every part of the world and revolutions?": 1,

    "We find ourselves in the paralyzing grip of self-destructive habits we can't break.": 1,

    " And injustice and violence sweep our world, bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death.": 1,

    "I would like to see Oracle take up that.": 1,
    " arm.": 1,
    " Some other technological geniuses work on this.": 1,
    "How do we change man?": 1,
    " so that he doesn't lie and cheat and our newspapers are not filled with stories of fraud in business or labor or athletics or wherever.": 1,
    " The Bible says the problem is within us, within our hearts and our souls.": 1,
    " Our problem is that we're separated from our creator.": 1,
    " which we call God.": 1,
    "And we need to have our souls restored.": 1,

    " I was just talking to someone when I was speaking at Princeton and I met Mr. Einstein.": 1,
    "He didn't have a doctor's degree because he said nobody was qualified to give him one.": 1,
    " But he made this statement.": 1,
    "He said, it's easier to denature plutonium than to denature the evil spirit of man.": 1,
    "And many of you, I'm sure, have thought about that and puzzled over it.": 1,
    " You've seen people take beneficial technological advances such as the internet we've heard about tonight and twist them into something": 1,
    " Corrupting.": 1,
    "You've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses that bring down whole systems.": 1,
    "The Oklahoma City bombing with simple technology.": 1,
    "Horribly used.": 1,
    "The problem is not technology.": 1,
    " The problem is the person or persons using it.": 1,
    " King David said,": 1,
    " that he knew the depths of his own soul.": 1,
    "He couldn't free himself from personal problems and personal evils that included murder and adultery.": 1,
    " Yet King David sought God's forgiveness and said, you can restore my soul.": 1,
    "You see, the Bible teaches that we're more than a body and a mind.": 1,
    " We are a soul.": 1,
    " And there's something inside of us that is beyond our understanding.": 1,
    "That's the part of us that yearns for God or something more than we find in technology.": 1,
    " Your soul is that part of you that yearns for meaning in life and which seeks for something beyond this life.": 1,

    " The old stars, they come to life.": 1,
    " And there.": 1,

    "And I said, the greatest surprise in my life is the brevity of life.": 1,
    "It passes so fast.": 1,
    " But it does not need to have to be that way.": 1,
    "Wernher von Braun.": 1,

    "On the contrary, they're sisters.": 1,
    " He put it on a personal basis.": 1,

    " who is looked upon as sort of the founder of modern Germany.": 1,
    " since the war.": 1,
    " And he said to me, young man, do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ?": 1,
    " And I said, sir, I do.": 1,
    "He said, so do I. He said, when I leave office, I'm going to spend my time writing a book": 1,
    " on why Jesus Christ rose again and why it's so important to believe that.": 1,
    " in one of his plays, Alexander Solzhenitsyn.": 1,
    " depicts a man dying, who says to those gathered around his bed, the moment when it's terrible to feel regret is when one is dying.": 1,

    " Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self-delusion.": 1,
    "On November 23, 1654, Pascal had a profound religious experience.": 1,
    " He wrote in his journal these words, I submit myself absolutely to Jesus Christ, my Redeemer.": 1,
    "A French historian said two centuries later,": 1,
    " seldom has so mighty an intellect submitted with such humility to the authority of Jesus Christ.": 1,
    " Pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God could bring us back into harmony.": 1,
    " But he believed.": 1,
    " that his own sins and failures could be forgiven, and that when he died, he would go to a place called heaven.": 1,
    " He experienced it in a way that went beyond scientific observation and reason.": 1,
    "It was he who penned the well-known words, the heart has its reasons, which reason knows not of.": 1,
    " Equally well known as Pascal's wager.": 1,
    "Essentially, he said this, if you bet on God and open yourself to his love, you lose nothing, even if you're wrong.": 1,
    " But if instead you bet that there is no God, then you can lose it all in this life and the life to come.": 1,
    " For Pascal, scientific knowledge paled beside the knowledge of God.": 1,
    "The knowledge of God was far beyond anything that ever crossed his mind.": 1,
    " He was ready to face him when he died at the age of 39.": 1,
    " King David lived to be 70, a long time in his era, yet he too had to face death.": 1,

    "This was David's answer to three dilemmas of evil, suffering, and death.": 1,
    "It can be yours.": 1,
    " as well as you seek the living God and allow him to fill your life and give you hope for the future.": 1,
    " When I was 17 years of age.": 1,
    " I was born and raised on a farm in North Carolina.": 1,
    "I milked cows every morning and had to milk the same cows every evening when I came home from school.": 1,
    "And there were 20 of them that I was responsible for.": 1,
    " and I worked on the farm.": 1,
    " and tried to keep up with my studies.": 1,
    "I didn't make good grades in high school.": 1,
    "I didn't make them in college until...": 1,
    " Something happened in my heart.": 1,
    "One day I was faced face to face.": 1,
    " with Christ.": 1,
    "He said, I'm the way, the truth, and the light.": 1,
    " Can you imagine that?": 1,
    "I am the truth.": 1,
    "I'm the embodiment of all truth.": 1,
    " He was a liar.": 1,
    " Or he was insane.": 1,
    " or he was what he claimed to be, which was he.": 1,
    " I had to make that decision.": 1,
    "I couldn't prove it.": 1,
    " I couldn't take it to a laboratory and experiment with it, but by faith, I said, I believe him.": 1,
    "And he came into my heart.": 1,
    " and changed my life.": 1,
    "And now, I'm ready.": 1,
    " when I hear that call.": 1,
    " to go into the presence of God.": 1,
    "Thank you and God bless all of you.": 1
