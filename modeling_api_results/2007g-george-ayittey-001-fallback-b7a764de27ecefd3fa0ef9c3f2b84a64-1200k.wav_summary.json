    " Well, first of all, let me thank IMEKA for Smartify TED Global for putting this conference together.": 1,
    " And this conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the 21st century.": 1,
    " You think African governments will put together a conference like this?": 1,
    "You think the AU will put together a conference like this?": 1,
    "Even before they do that, they will ask for foreign aid.": 1,
    " I would also like to pay homage and honor": 1,
    " to the Ted Fellows, June Arunga, James Chikwati, Andrew, and the other Ted Fellows.": 1,
    "I call them the Cheetah Generation.": 1,
    " The cheater generation is a new breed of Africans who broke no nonsense about corruption.": 1,
    "They understand what accountability and democracy is.": 1,
    "They're not going to wait for government to do things for them.": 1,
    " That's the cheetah generation.": 1,
    "And Africa's salvation rests on the backs of these cheetahs.": 1,
    " In contrast, of course, we have the hippo generation.": 1,
    " The hippo generation are the ruling elites.": 1,
    "They are stuck in their intellectual patch, complaining about colonialism and imperialism.": 1,
    "They wouldn't move one foot.": 1,
    " You ask them to reform the economies, they're not going to reform it because they benefit from the rotten status quo.": 1,
    "Now, there are a lot of Africans who are very angry, angry at the condition of Africa.": 1,
    " Now we're talking about a continent which is not poor, it is rich in mineral resources, natural mineral resources.": 1,
    " but the mineral wealth of Africa is not be utilized to lift its people out of poverty.": 1,
    " That's what makes a lot of Africans very angry.": 1,
    " And in a way, Africa is more than a tragedy, more ways than one.": 1,
    " There's another enduring tragedy, and that tragedy is there are so many people, so many governments, so many organizations who want to help the people in Africa they don't understand.": 1,
    " Now, we're not saying don't help Africa.": 1,
    "Helping Africa is noble.": 1,
    " But help in Africa has been turned into a fear of the absurd.": 1,
    "It's like the blind leading the clueless.": 1,
    " There are certain things that we need to recognize.": 1,
    " Africa's begging bowl leaks.": 1,
    "Did you know that 40% of the wealth created in Africa is not invested here in Africa?": 1,
    "It's taken out of Africa.": 1,
    "That's what the World Bank says.": 1,
    " Look at Africa's begging bowl.": 1,
    "It leaks horribly.": 1,
    " There are people who think that we should pour more money, more aid into this bowl which leaks.": 1,
    " What are the leakages?": 1,
    " Corruption alone costs Africa $148 billion a year.": 1,
    " Yeah, put that aside.": 1,
    "Capital flight out of Africa, 80 billion a year.": 1,
    " Put that aside.": 1,
    " Let's take food imports.": 1,
    "Every year, Africa spends $20 billion to import food.": 1,
    " Just add that up.": 1,
    "All these leakages.": 1,
    "That's far more than the 50 billion Tony Blair wants to raise for Africa.": 1,
    "Now back in the 1960s, Africa not only fed itself, it also exported food.": 1,
    "Not anymore.": 1,
    " We know that something has gone fundamentally wrong.": 1,
    "You know it, I know it.": 1,
    "But let's not waste our time talking about these mistakes because we spent all day here.": 1,
    "Let's move on.": 1,
    " and flip over to the next chapter.": 1,
    "And that's what this conference is all about, the next chapter.": 1,
    " The next chapter begins with first of all asking ourselves this fundamental question.": 1,
    "Whom do we want to help in Africa?": 1,
    " There's the people and then there's the government or leaders.": 1,
    " Now...": 1,
    " The speaker before me, the previous speaker before me, Idris Mohammed.": 1,
    " indicated that.": 1,
    " We've had abysmal leadership in Africa.": 1,
    " That characterization in my view is even more charitable.": 1,
    " I belong to an internet discussion forum, an African internet discussion forum.": 1,
    " And I asked them, I said, since 1960, we've had exactly 204 African heads of state since 1960.": 1,
    " And I ask them to name me just 20 good leaders.": 1,
    "Just 20 good leaders.": 1,
    "Maybe you want, you may want to take this, you know, leadership challenges, you know, yourself.": 1,
    "I ask them to name me just 20.": 1,
    " Everybody mentioned Nelson Mandela, of course, Kwame Nkrumah, Nyerere, Kenyatta, somebody mentioned Idi Ami.": 1,
    " I let that pass.": 1,
    " point is they couldn't go beyond 15.": 1,
    " Even if they had been able to name me 20, what does that tell you?": 1,
    "20 out of 204": 1,
    " means that the vast majority of the African leaders failed their people.": 1,
    " And if you look at them...": 1,
    " the slave of the post-colonial leaders.": 1,
    " an assortment of military, fufu heads, Swiss bank socialists, crocodile liberators, vampire elites, quack revolutionaries.": 1,
    " Now this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders that Africans have known for centuries.": 1,
    " The second, fourth premise that we make when we're trying to help Africa is that sometimes we think.": 1,
    " that there is something called a government.": 1,
    " in Africa that cares about its people.": 1,
    " serves the interests of the people and represents the people.": 1,
    " There is one particular quote.": 1,
    " Elisoto the chief once says that here in Elisoto we got two problems, rats and the government.": 1,
    " What you and I understand as a government doesn't exist in many African countries.": 1,
    "In fact, what we call our governments are vampire states.": 1,
    " Van passes because they suck the economic vitality out of their people.": 1,
    "Government is the problem in Africa.": 1,
    " A vampire state is a government.": 1,
    " which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves, their cronies and tribesmen and exclude everybody else.": 1,
    " The richest people in Africa are heads of state and ministers, and quite often the chief bandit is the head of state himself.": 1,
    " Where do they get their money?": 1,
    " By creating wealth?": 1,
    "No.": 1,
    "By raking it off the backs of their suffering people.": 1,
    " That's not wealth creation.": 1,
    "It's wealth redistribution.": 1,
    " The third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that": 1,
    " If we want to help the African people, we must know where the African people are.": 1,
    "Take any African economy.": 1,
    " An African economy can be broken up into three sectors.": 1,
    "There is the modern sector.": 1,
    " There is the informal sector and the traditional sector.": 1,
    " The morning sector is the abode of the elites.": 1,
    "It's the seat of government.": 1,
    " many African countries, the modern sector is lost.": 1,
    "It's dysfunctional.": 1,
    "It is a meretricious fandango of important systems which the elites themselves don't understand.": 1,
    " That is the source of many of Africa's problems, where the struggles for political power": 1,
    " emanate and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector, claiming innocent lives.": 1,
    " Now the modern sector, of course, is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into.": 1,
    " More than 80% of Ivory Coast developed and went into the modern sector.": 1,
    " the other sectors, the informal and the traditional sector.": 1,
    " are where you find the majority of the African people.": 1,
    "The real people in Africa, that's where you find them.": 1,
    "And obviously it makes common sense that if you want to help the people, you go where the people are.": 1,
    " But that's not what we did.": 1,
    " As a matter of fact, we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors.": 1,
    "The traditional sector is where Africa presides over agriculture.": 1,
    " which is one of the reasons why Africa can't feed itself.": 1,
    "And that's why it must import food.": 1,
    " All right, you cannot develop Africa by ignoring the informal, any traditional sectors.": 1,
    " And he can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work.": 1,
    " These two sectors, let me describe, you have their own indigenous institutions.": 1,
    " First one is the political system.": 1,
    "Traditionally, Africans hate governments.": 1,
    "They hate tyranny.": 1,
    "If you look into their traditional systems, Africans organized their states into tribes.": 1,
    " The first one belonged to those ethnic societies who believed that the state was necessarily tyrannous, so they didn't want to have anything to do with any centralized authority.": 1,
    " These societies are the Igbo, the Somali, the Kikuyu, for example.": 1,
    "They have no chiefs.": 1,
    " The other ethnic groups which did have chiefs made sure that they surrounded the chiefs with councils upon councils upon councils to prevent them from abusing their power.": 1,
    " And the Ashanti Kingdom, for example, the chief cannot make any decision without the concurrence of the Council of Elders.": 1,
    "Without the council, the chief can't pass any law.": 1,
    " And if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people, he will be removed.": 1,
    "If not, the people will abandon the chief, go somewhere else and set up a new settlement.": 1,
    "And even if you look in ancient African empires,": 1,
    " They were all organized around one particular principle, the confederacy principle, which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority, decentralization of power.": 1,
    " Now this is what I have described to you.": 1,
    "This is part of Africa's indigenous political heritage.": 1,
    "Now compare that to the modern systems.": 1,
    "The ruling elites established on Africa.": 1,
    "It's a total far cry.": 1,
    " in the economic system.": 1,
    " In traditional Africa, the means of production is privately owned.": 1,
    "It's owned by extended families.": 1,
    " You see, in the West, the basic economic and social unit is the individual.": 1,
    "The American would say, I am because I am and I can do anything I want anytime.": 1,
    "The accent is on the I.": 1,
    " In Africa, the Africans say, I am because we are.": 1,
    " The we connotes community, the extended family system.": 1,
    "The extended family system pulls its resources together, their own farms, they decide what to do, what to produce.": 1,
    "They don't take any orders from their chiefs.": 1,
    "They decide what to do.": 1,
    " And when they produce their crops,": 1,
    " They sell the surplus on marketplaces.": 1,
    "When they make a profit, it is theirs to keep, not for the chief to sequester it from them.": 1,
    " So in a nutshell, what we had in traditional Africa was a free market system.": 1,
    "There were markets in Africa before the colonialistic food on the continent.": 1,
    "Timbuktu was one great big market town.": 1,
    "Kandu, Salaga, they were all there.": 1,
    "Even if you go to West Africa,": 1,
    " You notice that market activity in West Africa has always been dominated by women.": 1,
    "So it's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace.": 1,
    "The market is not alien to Africa.": 1,
    " What Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism.": 1,
    "But then, after independence, all of a sudden, markets, capitalism became a Western institution.": 1,
    " And the leader said, Africans were ready for socialism.": 1,
    "Nonsense.": 1,
    " And even then, what kind of socialism did they practice?": 1,
    "The socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of Swiss bank socialism.": 1,
    " which allowed the head of states and the ministers to rip and plant the treasures for deposit in Switzerland.": 1,
    "That is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries.": 1,
    " What do we do now?": 1,
    "Go back to Africa's indigenous institutions.": 1,
    "And this is where we charge the tutors to go into the informal sectors, the traditional sectors.": 1,
    "That's where you find the African people.": 1,
    " And I'd like to show you a quick little video about the informal sector, about the board building that I myself tried to mobilize Africans in the diaspora to invest in.": 1,
    "Could you please show that?": 1,
    " Ahem.": 1,
    " I don't understand, I don't understand what you're saying.": 1,
    " Traditionally, Ghanaians afford to stay in this small boat.": 1,
    "There's a hundred prices.": 1,
    "This is by a local, Ghanaian entrepreneur, using his own capital.": 1,
    " He's getting no assistance from the government and he's building such a bigger boat.": 1,
    "A bigger boat will need more fish, will be caught and landed.": 1,
    " means that you will be able to employ more Ghanaians.": 1,
    "It also means that you will be able to generate wealth and then it will have what economists call external effects on the local economy.": 1,
    " All that the elites need to do is to move this operation into something which is enclosed so that the operation can be made more efficient.": 1,
    "Now, it is not just this informal sector.": 1,
    " There is also traditional medicine.": 1,
    "80% of Africans still rely on traditional medicine.": 1,
    "The modern health sector has totally collapsed.": 1,
    " Now, this is an area, I mean, there is a trover, trover trace of wealth in the traditional medicine area.": 1,
    "This is where we need to mobilize Africans.": 1,
    " the diaspora especially to invest in this.": 1,
    "We also need to mobilize Africans in the diaspora not only to go into the traditional sectors also but to go into agriculture and also to instigate.": 1,
    " change from within.": 1,
    "We were able to mobilize Ghanaians in a diaspora to instigate change in Ghana and bring about democracy in Ghana.": 1,
    "And I know that with the cheaters, we can take Africa back.": 1,
    " one village at a time.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
