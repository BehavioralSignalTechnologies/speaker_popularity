    " when I knew I was gonna come speak to you.": 1,
    " I thought.": 1,
    " I gotta call my mother.": 1,
    " I have a little Cuban mother, she's got that big.": 1,
    "Four feet nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts.": 1,
    "You still with me?": 1,
    " I called her up, hello, how you doing, baby?": 1,
    "Hey, man, I gotta talk to you.": 1,
    "You talking to me already, what's the matter?": 1,
    "I said, I gotta talk to a bunch of nice people.": 1,
    "You always talking to nice people, except when you went to the White House.": 1,
    "Man, I'll start.": 1,
    " Mm-hmm.": 1,
    " And I told her I was coming to Ted.": 1,
    "And she said, what's the problem?": 1,
    "I said, well, I'm not sure.": 1,
    "I said,": 1,
    " I have to talk to them about stories.": 1,
    " It's technology, entertainment, and design.": 1,
    "And she said, well.": 1,
    " You design a story when you make it up, it's entertainment when you tell it, and you're gonna use a microphone.": 1,
    " I said you're a peach, ma.": 1,
    "Father, what's the matter?": 1,
    "The pearls of wisdom leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you.": 1,
    " Then my pop got on there.": 1,
    "My pop, he's one of the old souls, you know?": 1,
    "Old Cuban man from Camaguey.": 1,
    "Camaguey is a province in Cuba.": 1,
    "He's from Florida.": 1,
    " He was born there in 1924.": 1,
    "He grew up in a boyo of dirt floors, and the structure was the kind used by the Ta\u00ednos, our old Arawak ancestors.": 1,
    " My father is at once quick-witted, wickedly funny.": 1,
    " And then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you.": 1,
    " It's breathless.": 1,
    "Bobby, help.": 1,
    "I already heard your mother.": 1,
    "I think she's right.": 1,
    " after what I just told you.": 1,
    "My whole life, my father's been there.": 1,
    "So we talked for a few minutes and he said, why didn't you tell him what you believe?": 1,
    "I love that.": 1,
    "But we don't have the time.": 1,
    " Good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to.": 1,
    "Great story is the art of letting go.": 1,
    " So I want to tell you a little story.": 1,
    " Remember, this tradition comes to us not from the mists of Avalon back in time, but further still, before we were scratching out these stories on papyrus, when we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist, damp caves.": 1,
    " Back then, we had an urge, a need to tell the story.": 1,
    "When Lexus wants to sell you a car, they're telling you a story.": 1,
    "Have you been watching the commercials?": 1,
    " because every one of us has this desire for once, just once, to tell our story and have it heard.": 1,
    " There are stories you tell from stages.": 1,
    " There are stories that you may tell in a small group of people with some good wine.": 1,
    "And there are stories you tell late at night to a friend.": 1,
    " Maybe once in your life.": 1,
    " And then there are the stories that we whisper into a Stygian darkness.": 1,
    " I'm not telling you that story.": 1,
    "I'm telling you this, when it's called You're Gonna Miss Me, it's about human connection.": 1,
    " My Cuban mother, which I just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch.": 1,
    " came to the United States a thousand years ago.": 1,
    "I was born in 19, I forget, and I came to this country with them in the aftermath of the Cuban Revolution.": 1,
    "We went from Havana, Cuba to Decatur, Georgia.": 1,
    " And Decatur, Georgia is a small southern town.": 1,
    "And in that little southern town, I grew up and grew up hearing these stories.": 1,
    "But this story only happened a few years ago.": 1,
    " I called my mom.": 1,
    "It was a Saturday morning.": 1,
    "And I was calling about how to make a jaco.": 1,
    "It's a Cuban meal.": 1,
    "It's delicious.": 1,
    "It's savory.": 1,
    "It makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth.": 1,
    "Is that enough?": 1,
    "It makes your armpits juicy, you know?": 1,
    " That kind of food, yeah.": 1,
    "This is the sensory part of the program, people.": 1,
    " I called my mother and she said, Carmen, I need you to come please, I need to go to the mall and you know your father now, he takes a nap in the afternoon and I gotta go, I gotta learn to run.": 1,
    "Let me parenthetically pause you and tell you Esther, my mother had stopped driving several years ago to the collective relief of the entire city of Atlanta.": 1,
    " Any vehicular outing with that woman from the time I was a young child, guys, naturally included flashing blue lights.": 1,
    " but she'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue.": 1,
    "And when she did meet them, oh, she had wonderful, well.": 1,
    " Rapport.": 1,
    "Ma'am, did you know there was a light you just ran?": 1,
    "You don't speak English, no?": 1,
    " But eventually, every dog has its day, she ended up in traffic court where she bartered with the judge for a discount.": 1,
    "There's a historical marker.": 1,
    " But now she was a septuagenarian.": 1,
    "She'd stopped driving.": 1,
    "And that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to hair, have her hair dyed, you know, that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pantsuit.": 1,
    " No?": 1,
    "Same color as the Buick?": 1,
    "Anybody?": 1,
    "Alright.": 1,
    "Little pics on the legs where she does her needle point, these little loops.": 1,
    "Rock ports, they're for this.": 1,
    "That's why they call them that.": 1,
    " This is her ensemble.": 1,
    "This is the woman that wants me to come on a Saturday morning when I have a lot to do but it doesn't take long because Cuban guilt is a weighty thing.": 1,
    " I'm not going political on you.": 1,
    "And so, I go to my mother's.": 1,
    "I show up, she's in the carport.": 1,
    "Of course they have a carport.": 1,
    "The kind of corrugated roof, you know?": 1,
    "The Buick's parked outside and she's jingling, jangling a pair of keys.": 1,
    "I got a surprise for you, baby.": 1,
    " We're taking your car?": 1,
    "No, we.": 1,
    "Aye.": 1,
    "And she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a catastrophe.": 1,
    " Somebody, storytelling, interactive art, you can talk to me.": 1,
    "Oh, a driver's license, a perfectly valid driver's license issued evidently by the DMV in her own county of Gwinnett, blithering fucking idiots.": 1,
    " Is that thing real?": 1,
    "I think so.": 1,
    "Can you even see?": 1,
    "I guess I must.": 1,
    "Oh, Jesus.": 1,
    " She gets into the car, she's sitting on two phone books.": 1,
    "I can't even make this part up, because she's that tiny.": 1,
    "She's engineered an umbrella so she can bam, slam the door.": 1,
    "Her daughter, me, the village idiot with the ice cream cone in the middle of her forehead, is still standing there slack-jawed.": 1,
    " You're coming, you're not coming.": 1,
    "Oh my God.": 1,
    "I said, okay fine, does Pop know you're driving?": 1,
    "Are you kidding me?": 1,
    "How are you doing it?": 1,
    "He's gotta slip sometime.": 1,
    " And so we left my father fast asleep, because I know he'd kill me if I let her go by herself.": 1,
    "We get in the car, puts it in reverse.": 1,
    "55, out of the driveway, in reverse.": 1,
    "I am buckling in seat belts from the front.": 1,
    "I'm yanking them in from the back.": 1,
    "I'm doing double knots.": 1,
    " I mean, I've got a mouth as dry as the Kalahari Desert, white gold knuckle grip on the door.": 1,
    "You know what I'm talking about?": 1,
    "And she's...": 1,
    " And finally, I do the kind of birth breathing, you know, that one.": 1,
    "Only a couple of women are going, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.": 1,
    "All right.": 1,
    " I said, Ma, would you slow down?": 1,
    "Because now she's picked up the highway 285, the perimeter around Atlanta, which encompasses now, it has seven lanes.": 1,
    "She's on all of them, y'all.": 1,
    " I said, Ma, pick a lane.": 1,
    "They give you seven lanes, they expect you to use them.": 1,
    "And there she goes, all right?": 1,
    " I don't believe for a minute she has been out and not been stopped.": 1,
    "So I think we can talk.": 1,
    "It'll be a diversion.": 1,
    "It'll help my breathing.": 1,
    "It'll do something for my pulse maybe.": 1,
    "Mommy, I know you have been stopped.": 1,
    "No, no, no, what are you talking about?": 1,
    " You have a license, only been driving four or five days.": 1,
    "Yeah, and you haven't been stopped.": 1,
    "I did not get a ticket.": 1,
    " I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but come on, come on, come on.": 1,
    "Okay, so I stop at a light and there's a guy in the back with this guy have like a blue uniform and a terrified look on his face.": 1,
    "If you were there, don't start, come on.": 1,
    " You got a ticket?": 1,
    "No, she explained.": 1,
    " The man, I have to tell you, she did because it loses something if I don't, you know?": 1,
    "He come to the window and he does a thing like this which tells me he's pretty old, you know?": 1,
    " So I look up and I'm thinking, maybe he's still going to think I'm kind of cute.": 1,
    "Ma, are you still doing that?": 1,
    "Baby, horsey horse, baby.": 1,
    "So I say, but I don't know English.": 1,
    "Well, wouldn't you know he had been in Honduras with the Peace Corps.": 1,
    " So he's talking to her and at some point she says, and then, you know, it was it.": 1,
    "That was it.": 1,
    "It was done.": 1,
    " What?": 1,
    "He gave you a ticket.": 1,
    "He didn't give you a ticket.": 1,
    "What?": 1,
    "No, I look up and the light change.": 1,
    " You should be terrified.": 1,
    "Now I don't know if she's toying with me, kind of like a cat batting back a mouse, batting back a mouse.": 1,
    "Left paw, right paw, left paw, right paw.": 1,
    "But by now I've reached the mall.": 1,
    "Now you all have all been at a mall during the holidays, yes?": 1,
    "Talk to me, yes?": 1,
    " You can say jizz.": 1,
    "All right, then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory, praying to that saying to perpetual availability, that as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along, some guy's gonna turn on the brake lights just as you pull up behind him.": 1,
    "But that doesn't happen.": 1,
    " most of the time, right?": 1,
    "So first I say, Ma, why are we here?": 1,
    "You mean like in the cosmic?": 1,
    "No, do, do.": 1,
    "Why are we here today?": 1,
    "It's Saturday.": 1,
    "It's the holidays.": 1,
    " Because I have to exchange your father's underwear.": 1,
    "Now see, this is the kind of Machiavellian thinking that you really have to, you know, in my mind it's a rabbit's war in this woman's mind.": 1,
    " Do I want to walk in because unless I have Ariadne's thread to anchor enough metaphors for you somewhere I may not get out but you know": 1,
    " Why do we have to take Pops underwear back now?": 1,
    "And why, what is wrong with his underwear?": 1,
    " It will upset you.": 1,
    "It will upset me.": 1,
    "What could I say?": 1,
    "Is something wrong with him?": 1,
    "No, no, no.": 1,
    "The only thing with him is he's an idiot.": 1,
    "I sent him to the store, which was my fair mistake, and he went to buy underwear and he bought the grippers and he's supposed to buy the boxers.": 1,
    " Why?": 1,
    "I read it on the internet.": 1,
    "You cannot have children.": 1,
    "Oh my god!": 1,
    " Olivia?": 1,
    " By now we have now crawled another four feet and my mother finally says to me, I knew it, I knew it, I'm an immigrant, we make a space.": 1,
    "What'd I tell you?": 1,
    "Right there.": 1,
    "And she points out the passenger window and I look out and three, three.": 1,
    " Isles down.": 1,
    " Look, the chevy.": 1,
    "You wanna laugh but you don't know.": 1,
    "You're that politically corrected, have you noticed?": 1,
    "Correct the other direction now, it's okay.": 1,
    " Look, the Chevy is coming this way.": 1,
    "Mama, mama, mama, wait, wait, wait.": 1,
    "The Chevy is three miles away.": 1,
    "She looks at me like I'm her, you know, her moron child, the cretin, the one she's gotta speak to very slowly and distinctly.": 1,
    " I know that honey, get out of the car and go stand in the parking space till I get there.": 1,
    "Okay, I wanna vote.": 1,
    "Come on, come on, no, no.": 1,
    "How many of you, once in your, you were a kid, you were an adult, you stood in a parking space.": 1,
    " to hold it for, see we're a secret club with a secret handshake.": 1,
    " And years of therapy later, we're doing great.": 1,
    "We're doing great, and we're doing fine.": 1,
    " Well, I stood up to her, this, this is, you know, you think by now I'm, and, still holding.": 1,
    " I said, no way, ma, you have embarrassed me my entire life.": 1,
    "Of course, her comeback is, when have I embarrassed you?": 1,
    "And she's still talking.": 1,
    "While she puts the car in park, hits the emergency brake, opens the door,": 1,
    " And with a spryness astounding in a woman her age, she jumps out of the car, knocks out the phone books, and then she walks around, she's carrying her cheap Kmart purse with her, around the front of the car.": 1,
    "She has amazing land speed for a woman her age, too.": 1,
    " Before I know it, she has skittled across the parking lot and in between the cars and people behind me with that kind of usual religious charity that the holidays bring us.": 1,
    " I'm calling Italian hand signals, follow.": 1,
    "I scoot over, I close the door, I leave the phone books.": 1,
    "This is moving fast.": 1,
    "Just so you know, you still with us?": 1,
    "We'll wait for the slow ones.": 1,
    " And this is where a child says to me and the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before because this is my laconic child a Brevity brevity of everything with this child, you know, she eats small portions Language is something to be metered out in in in small phonies": 1,
    " You know just little hmm She carries a mead spiral notebook and a pen.": 1,
    "She wields great power.": 1,
    "She listens Because that's what people who tell stories do first": 1,
    " but she pauses occasionally and says, how do you spell that?": 1,
    "What year?": 1,
    " When she writes the expose in about 20 years, don't believe a word of it.": 1,
    "But this is my daughter Lauren, my remarkable daughter, my borderline Asperger's kid.": 1,
    " Bless you, Dr. Watts.": 1,
    " She says, Ma, you gotta look.": 1,
    "Now when this kid says I gotta look, you know?": 1,
    " But it isn't like I haven't seen this crime scene before.": 1,
    "I grew up with this woman.": 1,
    "I said, Lauren, you know what?": 1,
    "Give me a play by play.": 1,
    "I can't.": 1,
    "No, mama, you gotta look.": 1,

    "She's holding out that cheap Kmart purse and she is wielding it.": 1,
    "She's holding back tons of steel.": 1,
    " with a sheer force of her little personality.": 1,
    " and that cronish voice saying things like, back it up buddy.": 1,
    "No, it's reserved.": 1,
    " Ready?": 1,
    "Brace yourselves.": 1,
    "Here it comes.": 1,
    "No, my daughter, she's coming in the Buick.": 1,
    "Honey, sit up so they can see you.": 1,
    " I finally come and now it's the South.": 1,
    "I don't know what part of the country you live in.": 1,
    "I think we all secretly love stories.": 1,
    "We all secretly want our blankie and our boo beer.": 1,
    "We want to curl up and say, tell it to me, tell it to me, come on honey, tell it to me.": 1,
    " But in the South, we love a good story.": 1,
    "People have pulled aside, I mean, they've come out of that queue line, they have popped their trunks, pulled out lawn chairs and cooled drinks, bets are placed.": 1,

    "I come out and there's Esther.": 1,
    " She's hugging the purse.": 1,
    "Which means what?": 1,
    "And so much more.": 1,
    " Ma, have you no shame?": 1,
    "People are watching us all around, right?": 1,
    "Now, some of them, you gotta make up people.": 1,
    "Secret of the trade, guess what?": 1,
    "Some of these stories, I sculpt a little here and there.": 1,
    "Some, they're just right there, right there.": 1,
    " Put them right there.": 1,
    "She says this to me.": 1,
    " After I say, let me refresh you, have you no shame?": 1,
    " No.": 1,
    "I gave it up with pantyhose.": 1,
    "They're both too binding.": 1,
    " Go ahead, you can clap but then you're about 30 seconds from the end.": 1,
    " I'm about to snap like a brittle twig when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder, intrepid soul.": 1,
    "I'm thinking, this is my kid.": 1,
    "How dare she?": 1,
    "She jumped out of that car.": 1,
    "That's okay because my mother yells at me, I yell at her.": 1,
    "It's a beautiful hierarchy and it works.": 1,

    "She's a little taller than I, pale green, amused eyes.": 1,
    "With her is a young man, husband, brother, lover.": 1,
    "It's not my job.": 1,
    "And she says, pardon me ma'am.": 1,
    "So we talk down there.": 1,
    "Is that your mother?": 1,
    " I said, no, I follow little old women around parking lots to see if they'll stop.": 1,
    "Yes, it's my mother.": 1,
    "The boy, now he says, well, what my sister meant, they look at each other, it's a knowing glance.": 1,

    "And the young girl and the young boy said, no, no, honey, we just want to know one more thing.": 1,
    "I mean, I said, look, please let me take care of her.": 1,
    "Cause I know her and believe me, she's, she's like a small atomic weapon.": 1,
    "You know, you just want to handle her really gingerly.": 1,

    " I know, but I mean, I swear to God she reminds us of our mother.": 1,

    " He turns to her on the heel of his shoe.": 1,
    "It's a half whisper.": 1,
