    "I felt great.": 2,
    " So when I was eight years old, a new girl came to join the class and she was so impressive as the new girl always seems to be.": 1,
    "She had vast quantities of very shiny hair and cute little pencil case.": 1,
    " super strong on state capitals and just a great speller and I just I curdled with jealousy that year until I hatched my devious plan.": 1,
    " So one day I stayed a little late after school, a little too late, and I lurked in the girl's bathroom.": 1,
    "When the coast was clear, I emerged, crept into the classroom and took from my teacher's desk the gradebook.": 1,
    " and then I did it.": 1,
    " I fiddled with my rivals' grades.": 1,
    "Just a little.": 1,
    "Just demoted some of those A's.": 1,
    "All of those A's.": 1,
    "And...": 1,
    " I got ready to return the book to the drawer when hang on, some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too.": 1,
    " So, in a frenzy, I corrected everybody's marks.": 1,
    "Not imaginatively, not imaginatively, I gave everybody a row of D's and I gave myself a row of A's just because I was there, you know, might as well.": 1,
    " I am still baffled by my behavior.": 1,
    "I don't understand where the idea came from.": 1,
    "I don't understand why I felt so great doing it.": 1,
    "I don't understand why I was never caught.": 1,
    " It should have been so blatantly obvious.": 1,
    "I was never caught.": 1,
    "But most of all, I'm baffled by why did it bother me so much that this little girl, this tiny little girl was so good at spelling?": 1,
    " Jealousy baffles me.": 1,
    "It's so mysterious and it's so pervasive.": 1,
    "We know babies suffer from jealousy.": 1,
    " We know primates do.": 1,
    "Bluebirds are actually very prone.": 1,
    "We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States.": 1,
    " And yet, I have never read a study that can parse to me its loneliness or its longevity or its grim thrill.": 1,
    " For that, we have to go to fiction, because the novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration.": 1,
    "In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if we didn't have jealousy": 1,
    " Would we even have literature?": 1,
    "Well, no Faithless Helen, no Odyssey, no Jealous King, no Arabian Nights, no Shakespeare.": 1,
    " There goes high school reading lists because we're losing Sound and the Fury, we're losing Gatsby, Sun Also Rises, we're losing Madame Bovary, Anna Kay.": 1,
    " No jealousy, no Proust.": 1,
    "And now, I mean, I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers to everything, but in the case of jealousy...": 1,
    " In the case of jealousy, he kind of does.": 1,
    "He kind of does.": 1,
    "This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, In Search of Lost Time.": 1,
    " And it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness, my brand, that we can hope to have.": 1,
    " And we think about Proust, we think about the sentimental bits, right?": 1,
    "We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep.": 1,
    "We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea.": 1,
    " We forget how harsh his vision was.": 1,
    "We forget how pitiless he is.": 1,
    "I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut.": 1,
    "I don't know what cat gut is, but let's assume it's formidable.": 1,
    " Let's look at why they go so well together, the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust.": 1,
    "Is it something as obvious that": 1,
    " Jealousy, which boils down into person desire, impediment, is such a solid narrative foundation.": 1,
    " I don't know, I think it cuts very close to the bone.": 1,
    "Because let's think about what happens when we feel jealous.": 1,
    "When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story.": 1,
    "We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives.": 1,
    " And these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible as the teller of the tale and the audience.": 1,
    "We know just what details to include to dig that knife in.": 1,
    " Right?": 1,
    "Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists.": 1,
    "And this is something Proust understood.": 1,
    " In the first volume, Swan's Way, the series of books, Swan, one of the main characters, is thinking very...": 1,
    " Vaughan leaves his mistress and how great she is in bed, and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences, and these are Proustian sentences, so their long is reversed, but in the course of a few sentences, he suddenly recoils and he realizes,": 1,
    " Hang on.": 1,
    "Everything I love about this woman, somebody else would love about this woman.": 1,
    "Everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure maybe right about now.": 1,
    " And this is the story he starts to tell himself.": 1,
    "And from then on, Proust writes that every fresh charm Swan detects in his mistress, he adds to his collection of instruments in his private torture chamber.": 1,
    " Now, Swan and Proust, we have to admit, were notoriously jealous.": 1,
    "Proust's boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him.": 1,
    " But you don't have to be that jealous to concede that it's hard work, right?": 1,
    "Jealousy is exhausting.": 1,
    "It's a hungry emotion.": 1,
    "It must be fed.": 1,
    "And what does jealousy like?": 1,
    " Jealousy likes information.": 1,
    "Jealousy likes details.": 1,
    "Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair, the cute little pencil case.": 1,
    "Jealousy likes photos.": 1,
    "That's why Instagram is such a hit.": 1,
    " Chris actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy.": 1,
    "When Swan is in like his jealous throes and suddenly he's listening at doorways and bribing his mistress's servants, he defends these behaviors.": 1,
    "He says, you know, look, I know you think this is repugnant.": 1,
    " But it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument.": 1,
    "He says they are scientific investigations with real intellectual value.": 1,
    " Bruce is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd.": 1,
    "But it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge, a quest for truth.": 1,
    " Painful truth, and actually where Proust is concerned, the more painful the truth, the better.": 1,
    "Grief, humiliation, loss, these were the avenues to wisdom for Proust.": 1,
    "He says,": 1,
    " A woman whom we need, who makes us suffer, elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us.": 1,
    " Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women?": 1,
    "No, I think he's trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves.": 1,
    "And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way?": 1,
    " any other emotion revealed to us, our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement.": 1,
    " Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity?": 1,
    " Freud would write about this later.": 1,
    "One day, Freud is visited by this very anxious young man who is consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him.": 1,
    " And Freud says it's something strange about this guy because he's not looking at what his wife is doing because she's blameless.": 1,
    "Everybody knows it.": 1,
    "Poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause.": 1,
    " But he's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing.": 1,
    "Unintentional behaviors.": 1,
    "Is she smiling too brightly here or did she accidentally brush up against a man there?": 1,
    " Proust says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife's unconscious.": 1,
    " But the novel is very good on this point.": 1,
    "The novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy.": 1,
    "In fact, the more intensely jealous we are, the more we become residents of fantasy.": 1,
    " And this is why I think jealousy doesn't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things.": 1,
    " Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive.": 1,
    "Now, I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede, but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news.": 1,
    "A 52-year-old Michigan woman": 1,
    " was caught creating a fake Facebook account from which she sent vile, hideous messages to herself for a year.": 1,
    " for a year, a year.": 1,
    "And she was trying to frame her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend.": 1,
    "And I have to confess, when I heard this, I just reacted with admiration.": 1,
    " Because, I mean, let's be real.": 1,
    "What immense, if misplaced, creativity.": 1,
    "Right?": 1,
    " This is something from a novel.": 1,
    "This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel.": 1,
    "Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine.": 1,
    "She is the...": 1,
    " very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters.": 1,
    "She's the author of Strangers on a Train and the Talented Mr. Ripley.": 1,
    "Books that are all about how jealousy": 1,
    " It muddles our minds.": 1,
    "And once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy, the membrane between": 1,
    " what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant.": 1,
    " Take Tom Ripley, her most famous character.": 1,
    "Now, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have.": 1,
    " to being you and having what you once had.": 1,
    "And you're under the floorboards.": 1,
    "He's answering to your name.": 1,
    "He's wearing your rings, emptying your bank account.": 1,
    " That's one way to go.": 1,
    " But what do we do?": 1,
    "We can't go the Tom Ripley route.": 1,
    "I can't give the world D's as much as I would really like to some days.": 1,
    "And it's a pity because we live in envious times.": 1,
    "We live in jealous times.": 1,
    " I mean, we're all good citizens of social media, aren't we?": 1,
    "Were the currencies envy?": 1,
    " Does the novel show us a way out?": 1,
    " I'm not sure.": 1,
    "So, let's do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they are in possession of a mystery.": 1,
    "Let's go to 221B Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes.": 1,
    " When people think of Holmes, they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty, right?": 1,
    "This criminal mastermind.": 1,
    "But I've always preferred Professor Lestrade.": 1,
    " is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard who needs Holmes desperately, needs Holmes as genius, but resents him.": 1,
    "Oh, it's so familiar to me.": 1,
    " So, Lestrade needs his help, resents him, and sort of seeds with bitterness over the course of the mysteries.": 1,
    "But as they work together, something starts to change.": 1,
    " And finally, in the adventure of the six Napoleons, once Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution, the stray turns to Holmes and he says,": 1,
    " We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes.": 1,
    "We're proud of you.": 1,
    " And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand.": 1,
    "It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved in The Mysteries, and I find it very moving, this little scene, but...": 1,
    " It's also mysterious, right?": 1,
    "It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry, not emotion.": 1,
    "You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade, the next minute they're on the same side.": 1,
    "Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he's resented.": 1,
    " it's going to take a while.": 1,
    " Could it be so simple, though?": 1,
    "What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another?": 1,
    " Well maybe then we wouldn't have to resent somebody's excellence.": 1,
    "We could align ourselves with it.": 1,
    " But I like contingency plans.": 1,
    "So, while we wait for that to happen, let us remember that we have fiction for consolation.": 1,
    "Fiction alone demystifies jealousy.": 1,
    "Fiction alone domesticates it, invites it to the table.": 1,
    "And look who it gathers.": 1,
    " Sweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley.": 1,
    " crazy swan, Marcel Proust himself.": 1,
    " We are an excellent company.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
