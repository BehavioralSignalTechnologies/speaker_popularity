    " Thank you so much, Chris.": 1,
    " Truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice.": 1,
    "I'm extremely grateful.": 1,
    "I have been blown away by this conference and I want to thank all of you for the many": 1,
    " nice comments about what I had to say the other night.": 1,
    "And I say that sincerely partly because I need that.": 1,
    " Put yourselves in my position.": 1,
    " I flew on Air Force Two for eight years.": 1,
    " Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane.": 1,
    " I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me.": 1,
    " It's a true story, every bit of this is true.": 1,
    "Soon after, Tipper and I left the White House.": 1,
    " We were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville.": 1,
    " driving ourselves.": 1,
    " I know that sounds like a little thing to you, but...": 1,
    " I uh...": 1,
    " I looked in the rearview mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me.": 1,
    "There was no motorcade back there.": 1,
    "You've heard of phantom limb pain?": 1,
    " This.": 1,
    " This was a rented Ford Taurus.": 1,
    " It was dinner time, and we started looking for a place to eat.": 1,
    "We were on I-40.": 1,
    "We got to exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee.": 1,
    "We got off the X and started looking.": 1,
    "We found a Shoney's restaurant.": 1,
    " low-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it.": 1,
    "We went in and sat down at the booth and the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper.": 1,
    " She took our order and then went to the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear what she was saying.": 1,
    "And she said, yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper.": 1,
    " And the man said, he's come down a long way, hasn't he?": 1,
    " There's been kind of a series of epiphanies.": 1,
    "The very next day, continuing a totally true story, I got on a G5 to fly to Africa.": 1,
    " to make a speech in Nigeria in the city of Lagos on the topic of energy.": 1,
    "And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville.": 1,
    " And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you.": 1,
    "Tipper and I were driving ourselves, shown in these low-cost family restaurant chain with the man said, they laughed.": 1,
    " I gave my speech then went back out to the airport to fly back home.": 1,
    "I fell asleep on the plane until during the middle of the night we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling.": 1,
    " I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air and I looked and there was a man running across the runway.": 1,
    " and he was waving a piece of paper and he was yelling, call Washington, call Washington.": 1,
    " And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington?": 1,
    "I remembered it could be a bunch of things.": 1,
    " And...": 1,
    " But what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because a": 1,
    " One of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America's printed in Monterey.": 1,
    "I checked.": 1,
    " And the story began, former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday, quote, my wife Tipper and I have opened a low cost family restaurant.": 1,
    " named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.": 1,
    " Before I could get back to U.S.": 1,
    "soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on one of them had me in a big white chef's hat.": 1,
    " Chipper was saying, one more burger with fries.": 1,
    "Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton saying, congratulations on the new restaurant out.": 1,
    " We like to celebrate each other's successes in life.": 1,
    " I was going to talk about information ecology, but I was thinking that since I planned to make a lifelong habit of coming back to Ted, that maybe I could talk about that another time.": 1,
    " I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on.": 1,
    "What can you do about the climate crisis?": 1,
    " I wanna start with a couple of, I'm gonna show some new images and I'm gonna recapitulate": 1,
    " just four or five.": 1,
    "Now, oh, the slideshow.": 1,
    "I update the slideshow.": 1,
    "Every time I give it, I add new images because I learn more about it every time I give it.": 1,
    " It's like beach combing, you know?": 1,
    "Every time the tide comes in and out you find some more shells.": 1,
    "Just in the last two days we got the new temperature records in January.": 1,
    "This is just for the United States of America.": 1,
    " Starkel average for January is 31 degrees, last month was 39.5 degrees.": 1,
    "Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment.": 1,
    "I'm kidding.": 1,
    " But these are the recapitulation slides and then I'm going to go into a new material about what you can do.": 1,
    "But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these.": 1,
    " First of all, this is where we're projected to go with the U.S.": 1,
    "contribution to global warming under business as usual.": 1,
    "Efficiency in end-use": 1,
    " electricity and in use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit, efficiency and conservation.": 1,
    "It's not a cost, it's a profit.": 1,
    "The sign is wrong.": 1,
    " It's not negative, it's positive.": 1,
    "These are investments that pay for themselves, but they are also very effective in deflecting our path.": 1,
    " cars and trucks.": 1,
    "I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective.": 1,
    "It's an easy, visible": 1,
    " target of concern, and it should be, but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks.": 1,
    " Cars and trucks are very significant.": 1,
    "And we have the lowest standards in the world.": 1,
    "And so we should address that.": 1,
    "But it's part of the puzzle.": 1,
    "Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks.": 1,
    " Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference.": 1,
    "And with what Vinod and John Doar and others, many of you here,": 1,
    " a lot of people directly involved in this, this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it.": 1,
    "Carbon capture and sequestration, that's what CCS": 1,
    " stands for is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe.": 1,
    " Not quite there yet.": 1,
    "Okay, now, what can you do?": 1,
    " reduce emissions in your home.": 1,
    "Most of these expenditures are also profitable.": 1,
    "Installation, better design, buy green electricity where you can.": 1,
    "I mentioned automobiles.": 1,
    " Buy a hybrid.": 1,
    "Use light rail.": 1,
    "Figure out some of the other options that are much better.": 1,
    "It's important.": 1,
    " Be a green consumer.": 1,
    "You have choices with everything you buy between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis.": 1,
    " Consider this.": 1,
    "Make a decision to live a carbon neutral life.": 1,
    "Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this.": 1,
    " in a way that connects with the most people.": 1,
    "It is easier than you think.": 1,
    "It really is.": 1,
    " A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy.": 1,
    "It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions.": 1,
    " with the full range of choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced.": 1,
    " and what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net.": 1,
    "There is a carbon calculator.": 1,
    " Participant productions convened with my active involvement the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a consumer-friendly": 1,
    " carbon calculator.": 1,
    "You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are and then you will be given options to reduce and in": 1,
    " By the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through purchases of offsets.": 1,
    "Next, consider making your business carbon neutral.": 1,
    "Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think.": 1,
    " Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology or entertainment or design and architecture community.": 1,
    "Invest sustainably.": 1,
    "Majora mentioned this.": 1,
    " Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management.": 1,
    " Over time, people do what you pay them to do.": 1,
    " And if they judge how much they're gonna get paid on your capital that they've invested based on the short-term returns, you're gonna get short-term decisions.": 1,
    " A lot more to be said about that.": 1,
    "Become a catalyst of change, teach others, learn about it, talk about it.": 1,
    " The movie comes out, the movie is a movie version of the slideshow that I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining.": 1,
    " And it comes out in May.": 1,
    "Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it.": 1,
    " Consider sending somebody to Nashville.": 1,
    "Pick well.": 1,
    " And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow, repurposed with some of the personal stories, obviously replaced with a generic approach.": 1,
    " It's not just the slides, it's what they mean and it's how they link together.": 1,
    "And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer": 1,
    " for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it in mass in communities all across the country and we're going to update": 1,
    " the slideshow for all of them every single week to keep it right on the cutting edge.": 1,
    "Working with Larry Lessig, it will be at": 1,
    " somewhere in that process, posted with tools and limited use copyrights so that young people can remix it and use it and do it in their own way.": 1,
    " Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics?": 1,
    "It doesn't mean that I'm trying to convince, if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat.": 1,
    " We need Republicans as well.": 1,
    "This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is.": 1,
    "Become politically active.": 1,
    "Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work.": 1,
    " support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions, global warming pollution, and trading it.": 1,
    "Here's why.": 1,
    " As long as the United States is out of the world system, it's not a closed system.": 1,
    "Once it becomes a closed system,": 1,
    " with U.S.": 1,
    "participation, then everybody who's on a board of, how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation?": 1,
    " once it's a closed system you will have legal liability if you do not": 1,
    " urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided.": 1,
    "The market will work to solve this problem.": 1,
    " if we can accomplish this.": 1,
    " help with a mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring.": 1,
    "We have to change the minds of the American people because presently the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done.": 1,
    " And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did.": 1,
    "It's now repetition of short": 1,
    " hot button, 30 second, 28 second television ads.": 1,
    "We have to buy a lot of those ads.": 1,
    " Let's rebrand global warming, as many of you have suggested.": 1,
    "I like climate crisis instead of climate collapse, but again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this.": 1,
    " Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination.": 1,
    " That's really true.": 1,
    " I said the other night, and I'll repeat now, this is not a political issue.": 1,
    "Again, the Republicans here.": 1,
    " This shouldn't be partisan.": 1,
    "You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do.": 1,
    "This is an opportunity, not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here to bring more coherence to them.": 1,
    " We are one.": 1,
    "Thank you very much, I appreciate it.": 1
