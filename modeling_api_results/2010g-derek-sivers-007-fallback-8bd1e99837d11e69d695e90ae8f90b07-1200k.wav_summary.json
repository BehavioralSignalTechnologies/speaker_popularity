    "Okay?": 2,
    " Everyone, please think of your biggest personal goal.": 1,
    "For real.": 1,
    "Take a second.": 1,
    "You got to feel this to learn it.": 1,
    "Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal.": 1,
    "Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it.": 1,
    " Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do.": 1,
    "Imagine their congratulations and their high image of you.": 1,
    "Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud?": 1,
    "Don't you feel one step closer already like it's already becoming part of your identity?": 1,
    " Well, bad news, you should have kept your mouth shut, because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it.": 1,
    "The repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen.": 1,
    " Anytime you have a goal, there are some steps that need to be done, some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it.": 1,
    "Ideally, you would not be satisfied until you'd actually done the work.": 1,
    " But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it, psychologists have found that it's called a social reality, the mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done.": 1,
    "And then because you've felt that satisfaction, you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary.": 1,
    " I'll be right back.": 1,
    " So this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals, right?": 1,
    "So they hold it to it, hold us to it, yeah.": 1,
    "So let's look at the proof.": 1,
    " 1926, Kurt Lewin, founder of social psychology, called this substitution.": 1,
    "1933, Vera Mahler found when it was acknowledged by others, it felt real in the mind.": 1,
    " In 1982, he wrote a whole book about this, and in 2009, he did some new tests that were published.": 1,
    "It goes like this.": 1,
    " 163 people across four separate tests.": 1,
    "Everyone wrote down their personal goal.": 1,
    "Then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room, and half didn't.": 1,
    " And then everyone was given 45 minutes of work that would directly lead them towards their goal, but they were told that they could stop at any time.": 1,
    "Now those who kept their mouth shut": 1,
    " worked the entire 45 minutes on average, and when asked afterwards, said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal.": 1,
    " But those who had announced it quit after only 33 minutes on average, and when asked afterwards, said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal.": 1,
    "So, if this is true, what can we do?": 1,
    " Well, you could resist the temptation to announce your goal.": 1,
    " You can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgement brings, and you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing.": 1,
    "But if you do need to talk about something, you can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction.": 1,
    " such as, I really want to run this marathon, so I need to train five times a week and kick my ass if I don't, okay?": 1,
    "So audience, next time you're tempted to tell someone your goal, what will you say?": 1,
    "Exactly, well done.": 1
