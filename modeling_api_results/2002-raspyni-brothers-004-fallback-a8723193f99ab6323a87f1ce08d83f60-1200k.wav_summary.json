    "Over the top.": 4,
    "Here we go.": 3,
    "Yeah.": 3,
    "Shut up.": 2,
    " Okay.": 2,
    "That's right.": 2,
    "It's weird.": 2,
    " Thank you.": 2,
    " Please throw out the bean bag chairs.": 1,
    "There we go.": 1,
    "There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today, but this is really, I think, when it reached its peak as far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility.": 1,
    " Now, obviously, this is not something we do in our regular show.": 1,
    "It's something we just kind of learned for this.": 1,
    "So we're going to try.": 1,
    "But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag team?": 1,
    " What's your answer?": 1,
    " Nice job, Daniel.": 1,
    "Nice job.": 1,
    " Nice job.": 1,
    "Man, that was good.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    "No, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down.": 1,
    "You actually just did that.": 1,
    " That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today.": 1,
    "All right, let's show them something special.": 1,
    "Without a MacArthur Grant.": 1,
    "OK.": 1,
    " yeah look at this you know all kinds of different Ted is about invention let's be honest right last night Michael motion showed some juggling props he's invented and working on right now Dan's gonna show something he actually invented": 1,
    " A type of juggling I actually invented right after I saw another juggler do it.": 1,
    "Okay.": 1,
    "But that's... And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece.": 1,
    " Folks!": 1,
    " This is shaker cup juggling.": 1,
    "It's not a show stopper, but it certainly slows it down.": 1,
    "Oh yeah, it does.": 1,
    " Daniel.": 1,
    "Thank you guys.": 1,
    " more.": 1,
    " All right.": 1,
    " But now, pushing my luck, I'm skipping right to six cups.": 1,
    "In order to do six cups, I must have perfect control over three with my right hand.": 1,
    " with his left.": 1,
    " Perfect.": 1,
    " And now, all six cups.": 1,
    "Should I do it on the first try, or should I miss once on purpose?": 1,
    " First try, once on purpose.": 1,
    "How about if I try first and then decide?": 1,
    "Good idea.": 1,
    "Let's leave that.": 1,
    " Leave that door open.": 1,
    " It's time for Richard's help.": 1,
    "Oh good.": 1,
    " You know, every year at the conference, it's kind of become a condition for us to do something dangerous with Richard.": 1,
    "And we've always done something with the bullwhips.": 1,
    " Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone?": 1,
    " I think that's the next session.": 1,
    "So we've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this.": 1,
    "He actually assumes more of the danger in this.": 1,
    "Please stand up, Richard.": 1,
    " Sorry.": 1,
    " Now Richard, please.": 1,
    "Okay, sorry.": 1,
    " Richard, please stand in front of me.": 1,
    "Can I say something?": 1,
    "Sure.": 1,
    " Next year I rehearse with them.": 1,
    "I have no idea.": 1,
    "And that's the truth.": 1,
    "All right.": 1,
    "Please stand here in front of me.": 1,
    " I hate that.": 1,
    "Put your hands out like this, please.": 1,
    " No, come stay up with him.": 1,
    "This is of Danny Shastley Hold'em, but now he's got you for protection.": 1,
    "It's kind of neat.": 1,
    " Wow!": 1,
    "You've been working out!": 1,
    "No, shut up!": 1,
    " Having a little bit of Richard time, that's nice, that's good.": 1,
    "Okay, here we go.": 1,
    "Have him hold your wrist.": 1,
    "Please hold my wrist.": 1,
    "There you go.": 1,
    " Hmm.": 1,
    " First one.": 1,
    " All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard.": 1,
    " So, and Richard, what were we on the list, like 1,020?": 1,
    " I think we were just outside.": 1,
    " Having some bad flashbacks.": 1,
    "Don't hold me that hard.": 1,
    "I'm taking it.": 1,
    "We got one more we're gonna do.": 1,
    " You don't want to hold these, trust me.": 1,
    "Could you spread your legs a little bit?": 1,
    " Gloria, you want to do it?": 1,
    " Ready yet?": 1,
    " One more try.": 1,
    "Man, I don't want to get too close.": 1,
    " Could you just push the...": 1,
    " Boy.": 1,
    "That's cool.": 1,
    "I always wanted to try that.": 1,
    " Let's jump this way, though.": 1,
    "Now, we risk Richard's life.": 1,
    "It's only fair we risk our own lives.": 1,
    "So, to do that, I will juggle these three razor sharp sickles.": 1,
    " And as if that wasn't enough?": 1,
    "And judging by your response, it's not.": 1,
    "You were hoping for a little more bill.": 1,
    " I'm going to run up behind him.": 1,
    "Leap over my shoulder.": 1,
    "Up and over his shoulders.": 1,
    "Grab the blades in midair.": 1,
    "Land right there in a pool of blood.": 1,
    " Still juggling.": 1,
    " Impossible you say?": 1,
    " Incredible you say.": 1,
    "Why bother you say?": 1,
    " Here we go.": 1,
    "Just do it, Jungler Boys.": 1,
    "This guy invented air.": 1,
    "I think so, that's right.": 1,
    "Even in the pencil.": 1,
    "He invented the pencil.": 1,
    " All right, we'll do this trick, but please remember, it goes over 10 years to perfect.": 1,
    "10 years to perfect what you're about to see.": 1,
    "It's not that difficult.": 1,
    "We just don't like to practice that much.": 1,
    " Asshole, traveling too much.": 1,
    "Actually, we will take a second to prove this could be fake, that the blades are indeed razor sharp.": 1,
    "Will someone please throw a small farm animal onto the stage?": 1,
    " Or a virgin for a sacrifice.": 1,
    "Anything.": 1,
    "Where's Gloria?": 1,
    "No, she's got a farm animal.": 1,
    "Do you have a small farm animal?": 1,
    " I'm just trying to play the odds.": 1,
    "All right, here we go.": 1,
    "How are you feeling, Barry?": 1,
    "You feeling all right?": 1,
    "Yeah, it's all right.": 1,
    "Feeling everything's OK?": 1,
    "The atmosphere?": 1,
    "Yeah, a little sketchy.": 1,
    "Everything up here is OK?": 1,
    " This one's a little... Who's doing the lights?": 1,
    "Could you point that a little more directly into my eyeballs?": 1,
    "Is that possible?": 1,
    "I can still see a little if you just turn it down.": 1,
    "And turn up the intensity.": 1,
    "We're still pink in the middle.": 1,
    " Yeah, it's too far.": 1,
    "It's too much of a visual.": 1,
    " The design of the body.": 1,
    "The whole different thing.": 1,
    "Ready, Barry?": 1,
    "May we have our jumping music, please?": 1,
    " May we have it a bit louder?": 1,
    " What a good crew.": 1,
    " Whoa!": 1,
    " What's going on?": 1,
    " I thought I had the hard part.": 1,
    " Crank it up!": 1,
    "Come on and dance!": 1,
    " Come on and dance!": 1,
    " Somebody dance!": 1,
    " Samba!": 1,
    " Wow.": 1,
    "Okay, stop.": 1,
    "Wow, it's weird.": 1,
    "No one dances.": 1,
    "We're just two guys doing this.": 1,
    "I think that's uncomfortable for everyone.": 1,
    "The French judge... One more quick... The French judge gives it a 5.2.": 1,
    " In our bio, some of you may have read that we've won two world juggling championships.": 1,
    "And believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups.": 1,
    " We're going to show you right now an excerpt from a routine that we used to wipe out the other juggling team competition.": 1,
    " Good, okay one more.": 1,
    " I know what you're thinking.": 1,
    "Other juggling teams must really suck.": 1,
    " They're taking us to the set.": 1,
    " Shuggling's got a bad rap.": 1,
    " But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot.": 1,
    "And look, it has a twin.": 1,
    " There's still one more by my foot.": 1,
    "What do you want me to do with it?": 1,
    " Richard, you tell them it's your last year.": 1,
    " That's a pretty good setup, Richard.": 1,
    "Yeah, it's a good setup.": 1,
    "That's a big setup.": 1,
    "Alright, what I will do, I will use my panther-like reflexes.": 1,
    " Nice.": 1,
    " I got that one.": 1,
    "To reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel.": 1,
    " I touched it, Barry!": 1,
    " It's progress.": 1,
    "That's the thing.": 1,
    " How about that?": 1,
    "Who would've guessed?": 1,
    " Oh wait, it's on your side, Barry.": 1,
    " And it's awfully windy over there.": 1,
    "Yes, it is.": 1,
    "You wouldn't think it would affect half the stage, but it is.": 1,
    "Watch this what I'm going to do.": 1,
    "I'm going to slide the seventh one onto my foot.": 1,
    "Wow.": 1,
    "What a great trick, Barry.": 1,
    " Oh, look how it lies there.": 1,
    " Oh Barry, is there nothing you can't do?": 1,
    " You are my hero.": 1,
    " You're my Jim Say Jr.": 1,
    " Too much Olympics.": 1,
    "From my foot, I'll attempt to kick the seventh club.": 1,
    "Where, Barry?": 1,
    "Where?": 1,
    "Tell us, Barry.": 1,
    "Free, eagerly await your next syllable.": 1,
    " What will it be?": 1,
    "What gem of knowledge?": 1,
    "What pearl of wisdom?": 1,
    " Do you want to buy a vowel, baby?": 1,
    " Is that your final answer?": 1,
    "Alright!": 1,
    " You have to turn off the TV from time to time.": 1,
    " From my foot, the kick up into seven.": 1,
    "We will try all seven.": 1,
    "From six to seven.": 1,
    "That's a world record.": 1,
    "Really?": 1,
    "For us.": 1,
    "Yes.": 1,
    " Whenever you're ready, big guy.": 1,
    "Put your tongue away, Barry.": 1,
    " I'm tired.": 1,
    "Whoa.": 1,
    " Please, please stay seated.": 1,
    "Stay seated.": 1,
    " As now, to make this twice as difficult, we'll juggle the seven clubs back.": 1,
    "Seven club juggling.": 1,
    "Two back.": 1,
    "That's it.": 1
