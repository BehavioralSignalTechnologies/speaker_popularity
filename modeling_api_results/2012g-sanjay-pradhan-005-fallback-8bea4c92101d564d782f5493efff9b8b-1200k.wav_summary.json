    " I grew up in Bihar, India's poorest state.": 1,
    " And I remember when I was six years old, I remember coming home one day to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep.": 1,
    " My brothers and I dug in, and that's when my father came home.": 1,
    " He was livid, and I still remember how we cried when that cart with our half-eaten sweets was pulled away from us.": 1,
    " Later, I understood why my father got so upset.": 1,
    "Those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract.": 1,
    " My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar, and he had developed a firm stance against corruption, even though he was harassed and threatened.": 1,
    " His was a lonely struggle because Bihar was also India's most corrupt state, where public officials were enriching themselves than serving the poor.": 1,
    " who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling.": 1,
    " And I experienced this most viscerally when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty.": 1,
    "And as I went village to village,": 1,
    " I remember one day when I was famished and exhausted, and I was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree.": 1,
    "And just at that time,": 1,
    " one of the poorest men in that village.": 1,
    " invited me into his hut and graciously fed me.": 1,
    " Only I later realized that what he fed me": 1,
    " was food for his entire family for two days.": 1,
    " This profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life.": 1,
    "I resolved to give back.": 1,
    " Later, I joined the World Bank, which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries.": 1,
    "My initial work focused on Uganda.": 1,
    " where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans.": 1,
    " But after we disbursed the loans, I remember a trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools without textbooks or teachers, new health clinics without drugs.": 1,
    " And the poor, once again, without any voice or recourse.": 1,
    "It was Bihar all over again.": 1,
    " Bihar represents the challenge of development, abject poverty surrounded by corruption.": 1,
    " Globally, 1.3 billion people live on less than $1.25 a day.": 1,
    "And the work I did in Uganda": 1,
    " represents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practiced since 1944 when winners of World War II, 500 founding fathers,": 1,
    " and one lonely founding mother gathered in New Hampshire, USA to establish the Bretton Woods Institutions, including the World Bank.": 1,
    " And that traditional approach to development had three key elements.": 1,
    "First, transfer of resources from rich countries in the north to poorer countries in the south.": 1,
    " accompanied by reform prescriptions.": 1,
    "Second, the development institutions that channel these transfers.": 1,
    " were opaque, with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved.": 1,
    "And third, the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites.": 1,
    " with little interaction with the citizens who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance.": 1,
    " Today, each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment, open knowledge, open aid, open governance.": 1,
    " And together, they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar.": 1,
    " The first key shift is open knowledge.": 1,
    "Developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the US, Europe, or the World Bank.": 1,
    " They get their inspiration, their hope, their practical know-how from successful emerging economies in the South.": 1,
    "They want to know how China lifted 500 million people out of poverty.": 1,
    " in 30 years.": 1,
    "How Mexico's Oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children.": 1,
    " This is the new ecosystem of open knowledge flows, not just traveling north to south, but south to south.": 1,
    "And even south to north, with Mexico's oportunidades,": 1,
    " Today, inspiring New York City.": 1,
    " And just as these north to south transfers are opening up, so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers.": 1,
    "This is the second shift, open aid.": 1,
    " Recently the World Bank opened its vault of data for public use, releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators for 200 countries over 50 years.": 1,
    " And it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data.": 1,
    " Development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance.": 1,
    "Take geomapping.": 1,
    " In this map from Kenya, the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located.": 1,
    "And the darker the shade of green, the more the number of out-of-school children.": 1,
    " So this simple mashup reveals": 1,
    " That donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out of school children, provoking new questions.": 1,
    "Is development assistance targeting those who most need our help?": 1,
    " In this manner, the World Bank has now geomapped 30,000 project activities in 143 countries.": 1,
    "And donors are using a common platform to map all their projects.": 1,
    " This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accountability of aid.": 1,
    " And this leads me to the third, and in my view, the most significant shift in development, open governance.": 1,
    "Governments today are opening up.": 1,
    " just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability, from the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India, using mobile phones and social media, not just for political accountability.": 1,
    " but also for development accountability.": 1,
    "Are governments delivering services to the citizens?": 1,
    " So for instance, several governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public.": 1,
    " But you know there is a big difference between a budget that's public and a budget that's accessible.": 1,
    "This is a public budget.": 1,
    " And as you can see, it's not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources.": 1,
    "To tackle this problem, governments are using new tools": 1,
    " to visualize the budget so it's more understandable to the public.": 1,
    " In this map from Moldova, the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools, but good educational outcomes, and the red color shows the opposite.": 1,
    " Tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual.": 1,
    " And what's exciting is that with this openness, there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government.": 1,
    "So in the Philippines today,": 1,
    " Parents and students can give real-time feedback on a website, checkmyschool.org, or using SMS.": 1,
    " where the teachers and textbooks are showing up in school, the same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar.": 1,
    " And the government is responsive.": 1,
    "So for instance, when it was reported on this website that 800 students were at risk.": 1,
    " Because school repairs had stalled due to corruption, the Department of Education in the Philippines took swift action.": 1,
    " And you know what's exciting is that this innovation is now spreading south to south, from the Philippines to Indonesia, Kenya, Moldova and beyond.": 1,
    " In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations.": 1,
    "This is what the map of Tandale looked like in August 2011.": 1,
    " But within a few weeks, university students were able to use mobile phones and an open source platform to dramatically map the entire community infrastructure.": 1,
    " And what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working.": 1,
    " aggregated in the red bubbles that you see.": 1,
    " which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor.": 1,
    " Today, even Bihar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent, accessible, and responsive to the poor.": 1,
    " But you know, in many parts of the world, governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor.": 1,
    "And it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system.": 1,
    " These are the lonely warriors, like my father and many, many others.": 1,
    "And a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors": 1,
    " join hands so they can together overcome the odds.": 1,
    " So for instance, today in Ghana, courageous reformers from civil society, parliament and government have forged a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector.": 1,
    " And galvanized by this, reformers in parliament are now investigating dubious contracts.": 1,
    " These examples give new hope, new possibility to the problems I witnessed in Uganda or that my father confronted in Bihar.": 1,
    " Two years ago, on April 8, 2010, I called my father.": 1,
    " It was very late at night, and at age 80, he was typing a 70-page public interest litigation against corruption in a road project.": 1,
    " Though he was no lawyer, he argued the case in court himself the next day.": 1,
    "He won the ruling, but later that very evening, he fell and he died.": 1,
    " He fought till the end, increasingly passionate, that to combat corruption and poverty, not only did government officials": 1,
    " need to be honest, but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard.": 1,
    "These became the two bookends of his life.": 1,
    " And the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape.": 1,
    " Today, I'm inspired by these changes.": 1,
    "And I'm excited that at the World Bank, we are embracing these new directions, a significant departure from my work in Uganda 20 years ago.": 1,
    " We need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions, inspiring practitioners.": 1,
    " So aid becomes transparent, accountable and effective.": 1,
    "So governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with reformers and government.": 1,
    "We need to accelerate these shifts.": 1,
    " If we do, we will find that the collective voices": 1,
    " of the poor will be heard in Bihar, in Uganda, and beyond.": 1,
    "We will find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children.": 1,
    " we will find that these children too have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
