    " I'm sure that throughout the hundred thousand odd years of our species existence, and even before,": 1,
    " Our ancestors looked up at the night sky and wondered what stars are.": 1,
    "Wondering therefore,": 1,
    " how to explain what they saw in terms of things unseen.": 1,
    " Okay, so most people only wondered that occasionally, like today, in breaks from whatever normally preoccupied them.": 1,
    " What normally preoccupied them also involved yearning to know.": 1,
    "They wished they knew how to prevent their food supply from sometimes failing.": 1,
    " and how they could rest when they were tired without risking starvation.": 1,
    " Be warmer, cooler, safer, in less pain.": 1,
    "I bet those prehistoric cave artists would have loved to know how to draw better.": 1,
    " in every aspect of their lives.": 1,
    " They wished for progress just as we do, but they failed almost completely to make any.": 1,
    " They didn't know how to.": 1,
    "Discoveries like fire happen so rarely that from an individual's point of view, the world never improved.": 1,
    "Nothing new.": 1,
    " was learned.": 1,
    " The first clue to the origin of starlight happened as recently as 1899.": 1,
    "Radioactivity.": 1,
    " Within 40 years, physicists discovered the whole explanation, expressed as usual in elegant symbols.": 1,
    " But never mind the symbols, think how many discoveries they represent.": 1,
    "Nuclei and nuclear reactions, of course, but isotopes.": 1,
    " Particles of electricity.": 1,
    " Anti-matter.": 1,
    " neutrinos, the conversion of mass to energy, that's E equals MC squared, gamma rays,": 1,
    " Transmutation.": 1,
    " That ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists was achieved through these same theories that explain starlight.": 1,
    " and other ancient mysteries, and new unexpected phenomena, that all that": 1,
    " discovered in 40 years, had not been in the previous 100,000, was not for lack of thinking.": 1,
    " about stars and all those other urgent problems they had.": 1,
    "They even arrived at answers such as myths.": 1,
    " that dominated their lives, yet bore almost no resemblance to the truth.": 1,
    " the tragedy of that protracted stagnation.": 1,
    " isn't sufficiently recognized, I think.": 1,
    "These were people with brains of essentially the same design that eventually did discover all those things.": 1,
    " But that ability to make progress remained almost unused": 1,
    " until the event that revolutionized the human condition and changed the universe or so we should hope because that event was the scientific revolution ever since which our": 1,
    " knowledge of the physical world and of how to adapt it to our wishes,": 1,
    " has been growing relentlessly.": 1,
    "Now, what had changed?": 1,
    "What were people now doing for the first time that made that difference between stagnation and rapid, open-ended discovery?": 1,
    " How to make that difference is surely the most important universal truth that it's possible to know.": 1,
    "And worryingly, there's no consensus about what it is.": 1,
    " So I'll tell you, but I'll have to backtrack a little first.": 1,
    "Before the scientific revolution,": 1,
    " They believed that everything important, knowable, was already known, enshrined in ancient writings, institutions, and in some genuinely useful rules of thumb, which were, however,": 1,
    " entrenched as dogmas along with many falsehoods.": 1,
    "So they believed that knowledge came from authorities that actually knew very little.": 1,
    " And therefore, progress depended on learning how to reject the authority of learned men, the priests, traditions and rulers, which is why the": 1,
    " scientific revolution had to have a wider context, the enlightenment, a revolution in how": 1,
    " People sought knowledge, trying not to rely on authority.": 1,
    "Take no one's word for it.": 1,
    "But that can't be what made the difference.": 1,
    " Authorities had been rejected before many times, and that rarely, if ever, caused anything like the Scientific Revolution.": 1,
    "At the time, what they thought distinguished science": 1,
    " was a radical idea about things unseen known as empiricism.": 1,
    "All knowledge derives from the senses.": 1,
    " Well, we've seen that that can't be true.": 1,
    "It did help by promoting observation and experiment, but from the outset it was obvious that there was something horribly wrong with it.": 1,
    " Knowledge comes from the senses.": 1,
    "In what language?": 1,
    "Certainly not the language of mathematics, which Galileo rightly said, the book of nature is written.": 1,
    " Look at the world, you don't see equations carved on the mountain sides.": 1,
    "If you did, it would be because people had carved them.": 1,
    "By the way, why don't we do that?": 1,
    "What's wrong with us?": 1,
    " Empiricism is inadequate because": 1,
    " Well, scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen.": 1,
    "And the unseen, you have to admit, doesn't come to us through the senses.": 1,
    "We don't see": 1,
    " those nuclear reactions in stars.": 1,
    "We don't see the origin of species.": 1,
    "We don't see the curvature of space-time and other universes.": 1,
    "But we know about those things.": 1,
    "How?": 1,
    " Well, the classic empiricist answer is induction.": 1,
    "The unseen resembles the seen, but it doesn't.": 1,
    " You know what the clinching evidence was that space-time is curved.": 1,
    "It was a photograph, not of space-time, but of an eclipse with a dot there rather than there.": 1,
    " the evidence for evolution, some rocks and some finches, and parallel universes, again, dots there rather than there on a screen.": 1,
    "What we see in all these cases": 1,
    " bears no resemblance to the reality that we conclude is responsible.": 1,
    "Only a long chain of theoretical reasoning and interpretation connects them.": 1,
    " Ah, say creationists.": 1,
    "So you admit it's all interpretation.": 1,
    "No one's ever seen evolution.": 1,
    "We see rocks.": 1,
    " You have your interpretation, we have ours.": 1,
    "Yours comes from guesswork, ours from the Bible.": 1,
    " What creationists and empiricists both ignore is that in that sense no one's ever seen a Bible either.": 1,
    " that the eye only detects light, which we don't perceive.": 1,
    "Brains only detect nerve impulses.": 1,
    " And they don't perceive even those as what they really are, namely electrical crackles.": 1,
    "So we perceive nothing as what it really is.": 1,
    "Our connection to reality is never just perception.": 1,
    " It's always, as Karl Popper put it, theory-laden.": 1,
    " Scientific knowledge isn't derived from anything.": 1,
    "It's, like all knowledge, it's conjectural guesswork.": 1,
    " tested by observation, not derived from it.": 1,
    " So, were testable conjectures the great innovation that opened the intellectual prison gates?": 1,
    "No.": 1,
    "Contrary to what's usually said,": 1,
    " Testability is common in myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking.": 1,
    "Any crank claiming the sun will go out next Tuesday has got a testable prediction.": 1,
    " Consider the ancient Greek myth explaining seasons.": 1,
    " Hades, god of the underworld, kidnaps Persephone, the goddess of spring, and negotiates a forced marriage contract.": 1,
    " requiring her to return regularly and lets her go.": 1,
    "And each year, she is magically compelled to return, and her mother Demeter, goddess of the earth, is sad.": 1,
    " and makes it cold and barren.": 1,
    " That myth is testable.": 1,
    "If winter is caused by Demeter's sadness, then it must happen everywhere on earth simultaneously.": 1,
    " So if the ancient Greeks had only known that Australia is at its warmest when Demeter is at her saddest, they'd have known that their theory is false.": 1,
    " So, what was wrong with that myth and with all pre-scientific thinking?": 1,
    "And what then made that momentous difference?": 1,
    " I think there's one thing you have to care about.": 1,
    "And that implies testability, the scientific method, the enlightenment and everything.": 1,
    "And here's the crucial thing.": 1,
    " There is such a thing as a defect in a story.": 1,
    "I don't just mean a logical defect.": 1,
    "I mean a bad explanation.": 1,
    "What does that mean?": 1,
    " Well, an explanation is an assertion about what's there unseen that accounts for what's seen.": 1,
    "Because...": 1,
    " the explanatory role of Persephone's marriage contract could be played equally well by infinitely many other ad hoc entities.": 1,
    "Why a marriage contract and not any other reason for": 1,
    " regular annual action.": 1,
    "Here's one.": 1,
    "Persephone wasn't released, she escaped and returns every spring to take revenge on Hades with her spring powers.": 1,
    " She cools his domain with spring air, venting heat up to the surface, creating summer.": 1,
    "That accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth.": 1,
    "It's equally testable.": 1,
    " Yet what it asserts about reality is in many ways the opposite.": 1,
    "That's possible because the details of the original myth are unrelated to seasons except via the myth itself.": 1,
    " This easy variability is the sign of a bad explanation.": 1,
    "Because without a functional reason to prefer one of": 1,
    " countless variants.": 1,
    "Advocating one of them in preference to the others is irrational.": 1,
    " So, for the essence of what makes the difference to enable progress, seek good explanations, the ones that can't be easily varied while still explaining the phenomena.": 1,
    " Now our current explanation of seasons...": 1,
    " is that the Earth's axis is tilted like that, so each hemisphere tilts towards the Sun for half the year and away for the other half.": 1,
    " Better put that up.": 1,
    "That's a good explanation.": 1,
    " Hard to vary because every detail plays a functional role.": 1,
    "For instance, we know independently of seasons that surfaces tilted away from radiant heat are heated less and that a spinning sphere": 1,
    " in space points in a constant direction and the tilt.": 1,
    " also explains the sun's angle of elevation at different times of year, and predicts that the seasons will be out of phase in the two hemispheres.": 1,
    "If they'd been observed in phase,": 1,
    " The theory would have been refuted, but now the fact that it's also a good explanation, hard to vary, makes the crucial difference.": 1,
    " If the ancient Greeks had found out about seasons in Australia, they could have easily varied their myth to predict that.": 1,
    " For instance, when Demeter's upset, she banishes heat from her vicinity into the other hemisphere where it makes summer.": 1,
    " So being proved wrong by observation and changing their theory accordingly still wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks one jot closer to understanding seasons because their explanation was bad.": 1,
    " Easy to vary and it's only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it's testable if the axis tilt theory had been refuted": 1,
    " its defenders would have had nowhere to go.": 1,
    "No easily implemented change could make that tilt cause the same seasons in both hemispheres.": 1,
    " The search for hard to vary explanations is the origin of all progress.": 1,
    "It's the basic regulating principle of the Enlightenment.": 1,
    " So, in science, two false approaches blight progress.": 1,
    "One's well-known, untestable theories.": 1,
    "But the more important one is explanationless theories.": 1,
    "Whenever you're told that some existing statistical trend": 1,
    " will continue, but you aren't given a hard to vary account of what causes that trend.": 1,
    "You're being told a wizard did it.": 1,
    " When you're told that carrots have human rights because they share half our genes, but not how gene percentages confer rights, wizard.": 1,
    "When someone announces that the nature nurture debate": 1,
    " has been settled because there's evidence that a given percentage of our political opinions are genetically inherited.": 1,
    "But they don't explain how genes cause opinions.": 1,
    " They've settled nothing.": 1,
    "They're saying that our opinions are caused by wizards, and presumably so are their own.": 1,
    "That the truth...": 1,
    " consists of hard to vary assertions about reality is the most important fact about the physical world.": 1,
    "It's a fact that is itself unseen": 1,
    " yet impossible to vary.": 1,
