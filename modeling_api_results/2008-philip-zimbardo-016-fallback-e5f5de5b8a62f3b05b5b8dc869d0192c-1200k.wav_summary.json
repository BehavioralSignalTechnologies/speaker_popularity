    " Philosophers, dramatists, theologians have grappled with this question for centuries.": 1,
    "What makes people go wrong?": 1,
    " Interestingly, I asked this question when I was a little kid.": 1,
    "When I was a kid growing up in the South Bronx, in a city ghetto in New York, I was surrounded by evil, as all kids are who grow up in a city.": 1,
    " And I had friends who were really good kids who lived out the Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde scenario of Robert Louis Stevenson.": 1,
    "That is, they took drugs.": 1,
    " got in trouble, went to jail, some got killed, and some did it without drug assistance.": 1,
    "So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson, that was in fiction.": 1,
    "The only question is, what was in the juice?": 1,
    " And more importantly, that line between good and evil, which privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable, with them on the good side and the others on the bad side, I knew that line was immovable and it was permeable.": 1,
    " Good people could be seduced across that line and under some rare circumstances, bad kids could recover with help, with reform, with rehabilitation.": 1,
    " So I want to begin with this wonderful illusion by Swiss artist MC Escher.": 1,
    "If you look at it and focus on the white, what you see is a world full of angels.": 1,
    "But let's look more deeply.": 1,
    "And as we do, what appears is the demons, the devils in the world.": 1,
    " And that tells us several things.": 1,
    "One, the world is, was, will always be filled with good and evil, because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition.": 1,
    "It tells me something else, if you remember.": 1,
    "God's favorite angel was Lucifer.": 1,
    " Apparently, Lucifer means the light.": 1,
    "It also means the morning star in some scripture.": 1,
    "And apparently, he disobeyed God, and that's the ultimate disobedience to authority.": 1,
    " And when he did, Michael the Archangel was sent to kick him out of heaven along with the other fallen angels.": 1,
    " And so Lucifer descends into hell, becomes Satan, becomes the devil, and the force of evil in the universe begins.": 1,
    "Paradoxically, it was God who created hell as a place to store evil.": 1,
    " He didn't do a good job of keeping it there though.": 1,
    "So this arc of the cosmic transformation of God's favorite angel into the devil for me sets the context for understanding human beings who are transformed from good ordinary people into perpetrators of evil.": 1,
    " So the looser effect, although it focuses on the negatives, the negatives that people can become, not the negatives that people are,": 1,
    " leads me to a psychological definition.": 1,
    "Evil is the exercise of power, and that's the key, it's about power.": 1,
    " to intentionally harm people psychologically, to hurt people physically, to destroy people mortally or ideas, and to commit crimes against humanity.": 1,
    " If you Google evil, a word that should surely have withered by now, you come up with 136 million hits in a third of a second.": 1,
    "A few years ago, I'm sure all of you were shocked.": 1,
    " as I was, with the revelation of American soldiers abusing prisoners in a strange place in a controversial war, Abu Ghraib and in Iraq.": 1,
    "And these were men and women who were putting prisons through": 1,
    " an unbelievable humiliation.": 1,
    "I was shocked but I wasn't surprised because I had seen those same visual parallels when I was the prison superintendent of the Stanford Prison Study.": 1,
    " Immediately, the Bush administration and military said what?": 1,
    "What all administrations say when there's a scandal.": 1,
    "Don't blame us, it's not the system, it's the few bad apples, the few rogue soldiers.": 1,
    " My hypothesis is American soldiers are good, usually.": 1,
    "Maybe it was the battle that was bad.": 1,
    "But how am I going to deal with that hypothesis?": 1,
    " I became an expert witness for one of the guards, Sergeant Chip Frederick, and in that position I had access to the dozen investigative reports.": 1,
    "I had access to him.": 1,
    " I could study him, have him come to my home, get to know him, do psychological analysis to see was he a good apple or bad apple.": 1,
    "And thirdly, I had access to all of the thousand pictures that these soldiers took.": 1,
    " These pictures are of a violent or sexual nature.": 1,
    "All of them come from the cameras of American soldiers.": 1,
    "Because everybody has a digital camera, a cell phone camera, they took pictures of everything, more than a thousand.": 1,
    " What I've done is I organized them into various categories, but these are by United States Military Police Army Reservists.": 1,
    " There are not soldiers prepared for this mission at all.": 1,
    "And it all happened in a single place, Tier 1A on the night shift.": 1,
    "Why?": 1,
    "Tier 1A was the center for military intelligence.": 1,
    "It was the interrogation hold.": 1,
    " CIA was there, interrogators from Titan Corporation, all there, and they're getting no information about the insurgency.": 1,
    "So they're going to put pressure on these soldiers, military police, to cross the line.": 1,
    " Give them permission to break the will of the enemy, to prepare them for interrogation, to soften them up, to take the gloves off.": 1,
    "Those are the euphemisms.": 1,
    "And this is how it was interpreted.": 1,
    "Let's go down to that dungeon.": 1,
    " BELL RINGS": 1,
    " you": 1,
    " So pretty horrific.": 1,
    "That's one of the visual illustrations of evil.": 1,
    "And it should not have escaped you that the reason I paired the prisoner with his arms out": 1,
    " with Leonardo da Vinci's Ode to Humanity is that that prisoner was mentally ill.": 1,
    "That prisoner covered himself with shit every day and they used to have to roll him in dirt so he wouldn't stink.": 1,
    " But the guards ended up calling him shit boy.": 1,
    "What was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution?": 1,
    " In any event, here's former Secretary of Defense Romsfeld.": 1,
    "He comes down and says, I want to know who is responsible.": 1,
    "Who are the bad apples?": 1,
    "Well, that's a bad question.": 1,
    "You have to reframe it and ask, what is responsible?": 1,
    " Because what could be the who of people, but it could also be the what of the situation, and obviously that's where I'm headed.": 1,
    "So how do psychologists go about understanding such transformations of human character, if you believe that they were good soldiers before they went down to that dungeon?": 1,
    " There are three ways.": 1,
    "The main way is what's called dispositional.": 1,
    "We look at what's inside of the person, the bad apples.": 1,
    "This is the foundation of all of social sciences, the foundation of religion, the foundation of law.": 1,
    " Social psychologists like me come along and say, yeah, people are the actors on the stage, but you have to be aware of what the situation is.": 1,
    "Who are the cast of characters?": 1,
    "What's the costume?": 1,
    "Is there a stage director?": 1,
    "And so we're interested in what are the external factors around the individual, the bad barrel.": 1,
    " And social scientists stopped there, and they missed the big point that I discovered when I became an expert with the tribal group.": 1,
    "The power is in the system.": 1,
    "The system creates the situation that corrupts the individuals.": 1,
    " The system is the legal, political, economic, cultural background, and this is where the power is of the bad barrel makers.": 1,
    "So you want to change a person, you've got to change the situation.": 1,
    "You want to change the situation, you've got to know where the power is in the system.": 1,
    " So the looser effect involves understanding human character transformations with these three factors.": 1,
    " And it's a dynamic interplay.": 1,
    "What do people bring into the situation?": 1,
    "What does the situation bring out of them?": 1,
    "And what is the system that creates and maintains that situation?": 1,
    " So my book, The Looser Effect, recently published is about how do you understand how good people turn evil, and it has a lot of detail about what I'm going to talk about today.": 1,
    " So, Dr. Z's looser effect, although it focuses on evil, really is a celebration of the human mind's infinite capacity to make any of us kind or cruel.": 1,
    " caring or indifferent, creative or destructive, and it makes some of us villains.": 1,
    "And the good news story that I'm going to hopefully come to at the end is it makes some of us heroes.": 1,
    " This is a wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker which really summarized my whole talk.": 1,
    "I'm neither a good cop nor a bad cop, Jerome.": 1,
    "Like yourself, I'm a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not depending on the circumstances.": 1,
    " This is a study some of you think you know about, but very few people have ever read the story.": 1,
    "You watch the movie.": 1,
    " Stanley Milgram, little Jewish kid from the Bronx, and he asked the question, could the Holocaust happen here, now?": 1,
    "He said, no, that's Nazi Germany, that's Hitler, you know, that's 1939.": 1,
    "He said, yeah, but suppose Hitler asked you, would you electrocute a stranger?": 1,
    " No way, not me, I'm a good person.": 1,
    "He said, why don't we put you in a situation and give you a chance to see what you would do?": 1,
    "And so what he did was he tested 1,000 ordinary people, 500 New Haven, Connecticut, 500 Bridgeport, and the ad said,": 1,
    " Psychologists want to understand memory.": 1,
    "We want to improve people's memory because memory is a key to success, okay?": 1,
    " We're going to give you five bucks, four dollars for your time.": 1,
    "We don't want college students, we want men between 20 and 50, in the latest studies they ran, women.": 1,
    "Ordinary people, barbers, clerks, white collar people.": 1,
    "So you go down.": 1,
    " And one of you is going to be a learner, one of you is going to be a teacher.": 1,
    "The learner is a genial middle-aged guy.": 1,
    "He gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room.": 1,
    " Could be the middle age, could be as young as 20.": 1,
    "And one of you was told by the authority, the guy in the lab coat, your job as teacher is to give this guy material to learn.": 1,
    "Gets it right, reward him.": 1,
    "Gets it wrong, you press a button on the shock box.": 1,
    "First button is 15 volts.": 1,
    "He doesn't even feel it.": 1,
    " That's the key.": 1,
    "All evil starts with 15 volts.": 1,
    "And then the next step, there's another 15 volts.": 1,
    "The problem is, at the end of the line, it's 450 volts.": 1,
    " And as you go along, the guy is screaming.": 1,
    "He's got a heart condition.": 1,
    "I'm out of here.": 1,
    "You're a good person.": 1,
    "You complain.": 1,
    "Sir, who's going to be responsible if something happens to him?": 1,
    " The experiment says, don't worry, I will be responsible.": 1,
    "Continue, teacher.": 1,
    "And the question is, who would go all the way to 450 volts?": 1,
    "You should notice here when it gets up to 375, it says, dangerous, severe shock.": 1,
    " When it gets up to here, there's triple X, the pornography of power.": 1,
    "So Milgram has 40 psychiatrists.": 1,
    "What percent of American citizens would go to the end?": 1,
    " They said only 1% because that's sadistic behavior and we know psychiatry knows only 1% of Americans are sadistic.": 1,
    "Okay.": 1,
    " Here's the data.": 1,
    "They could not be more wrong.": 1,
    "Two-thirds go all the way to 450 volts.": 1,
    "This was just one study.": 1,
    "Milgram did more than 16 studies.": 1,
    "And look at this.": 1,
    " In study 16, when you see somebody like you go all the way, 90% go all the way.": 1,
    "In study 5, if you see people rebel, 90% rebel.": 1,
    " What about women?": 1,
    "Study 13, no different than men.": 1,
    "So Milgram is quantifying evil as the willingness of people to blindly obey authority to go all the way to 450 volts.": 1,
    " And it's like a dial on human nature, a dial in the sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient, down to the majority, down to none.": 1,
    " So what are the external parallels?": 1,
    "All research is artificial.": 1,
    "What's the validity in real world?": 1,
    "912 American citizens committed suicide or murdered by family and friends in Guyana jungle in 1978 because they were blindly obedient to this guy, their pastor, not the priest, their pastor.": 1,
    " Reverend Jim Jones, he persuaded them to commit mass suicide.": 1,
    "And so he's the modern Lucifer, the man of God who becomes the angel of death.": 1,
    " Milgram's study is all about individual authority to control people.": 1,
    "Most of the time, we are in institutions.": 1,
    "So the Stanford Prison Study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior.": 1,
    " Interestingly, Stanley Milgram and I were in the same high school class in James Monroe in the Bronx, 1954.": 1,
    " So this study, which I did with my graduate students, especially Craig Haney, we also began with an ad.": 1,
    "We didn't have money, so we had a cheap little ad.": 1,
    "But we wanted college students for study of prison life.": 1,
    " 75 people volunteered, took personality tests, we did interviews, picked two dozen, most normal, most healthy, randomly assigned them to be prisoner and guard.": 1,
    "So on day one, we knew we had good apples.": 1,
    "I'm going to put them in a bad situation.": 1,
    " And secondly, we know there's no difference between the boys who are going to be guards, the boys who are going to be prisoners.": 1,
    "The kids who are going to be prisoners said, wait at home in the dormitories, the study will begin Sunday.": 1,
    "We didn't tell them that the city police were going to come and do realistic arrests.": 1,
    " police car pulls up in front and a cop comes to the front door, knocks, and says he's looking for me.": 1,
    "So they, right there, they took me out the door, they put my hands against the car,": 1,
    " It was a real cop car, it was a real policeman, and there were real neighbors in the street who didn't know that this was an experiment.": 1,
    "And there was cameras all around, and neighbors all around, and they put me in the car, then they drove me around Palo Alto.": 1,
    " They took me to the police station, the basement of the police station.": 1,
    " Then they put me in a cell.": 1,
    "I was the first one to be picked up, so they put me in a cell, which was just like a room with a door with bars on it.": 1,
    "You could tell it wasn't a real jail.": 1,
    "They locked me in there in this degrading little outfit.": 1,
    " They were taking this experiment too seriously.": 1,
    "Here are the prisoners who are going to be dehumanized.": 1,
    "They're going to become numbers.": 1,
    "Here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity.": 1,
    " Guards get prisoners to clean the toilet bowls out, they bear hands, they do other humiliating tasks, they strip them naked, they sexually taunt them, they begin to do degrading activities, like having them simulate sodomy, you saw simulating fellatio in Soldiers in Abu Ghraib.": 1,
    " My guards did it in five days.": 1,
    "The stress reaction was so extreme that normal kids we've picked because they're healthy had breakdowns within 36 hours.": 1,
    "The study ended after six days because it was out of control.": 1,
    "Five kids had emotional breakdowns.": 1,
    " Does it make a difference if warriors go to battle changing their appearance or not?": 1,
    "Does it make a difference if they're anonymous and how they treat their victims?": 1,
    "We know in some cultures they go to war, they don't change appearance.": 1,
    "In other cultures they paint themselves like Lord of the Flies.": 1,
    " And some, they wear masks, and many, they wear soldiers that are anonymous in uniform.": 1,
    "So what this anthropologist, John Watson, found, 23 cultures that had two bits of data.": 1,
    "Do they change their appearance?": 1,
    "Do they kill, torture, mutilate? 13.": 1,
    " If they don't change their appearance, only one of eight kills torture mutilate.": 1,
    "The key is in the red zone.": 1,
    "If they change their appearance, 12 of 13, that's 90%, kill torture mutilate.": 1,
    " That's the power of anonymity.": 1,
    "So what are the seven social processes that grease the slippery slope of evil?": 1,
    "Mindlessly taking the first small step, dehumanization of others, de-individuation of self, diffusion of personal responsibility, blind obedience to authority,": 1,
    " on critical conformity to group norms, passive tolerance of evil through inaction or indifference.": 1,
    "And it happens when you're in a new or unfamiliar situation.": 1,
    "Your habitual response patterns don't work.": 1,
    "Your personality and morality are disengaged.": 1,
    " Nothing is easier than to denounce the evil doer.": 1,
    "Nothing more difficult than understanding him, Dostoevsky tells us.": 1,
    "Understanding is not excusing.": 1,
    "Psychology is not excuseology.": 1,
    " So social psychological research reveals how ordinary good people can be transformed without the drugs.": 1,
    "You don't need it.": 1,
    "You just need the social psychological processes.": 1,
    "Real world parallels.": 1,
    "Compare this with this.": 1,
    " James Schlesinger, I'm going to have to end with this, says, psychologists have attempted to understand how and why individuals and groups who usually act humanely can sometimes act otherwise in certain circumstances.": 1,
    "That's the looser effect.": 1,
    "And he goes on to say,": 1,
    " The landmark Stanford study provides a cautionary tale for all military operations.": 1,
    "If you give people power without oversight, it's a prescription for abuse.": 1,
    "They knew that and let that happen.": 1,
    " So another investigative report by General Fay says the system is guilty.": 1,
    "And in this report he says it was the environment created at Abu Ghraib by leadership failures that contribute to the occurrence of such abuse.": 1,
    " and the fact that it remained undiscovered by higher authorities for a long period of time.": 1,
    "Those abuses went on for three months.": 1,
    "Who was watching the store?": 1,
    "The answer is nobody, and I think nobody on purpose.": 1,
    "He gave the guards permission to do those things, and they knew nobody was ever going to come down to that dungeon.": 1,
    " So you need a paradigm shift in all these areas.": 1,
    "The shift is away from the medical model that focuses only on the individual.": 1,
    "And the shift is toward a public health model that recognizes situational and systemic vectors of disease.": 1,
    " Bullying is a disease.": 1,
    "Prejudice is a disease.": 1,
    "Violence is a disease.": 1,
    "And since the Inquisition we've been dealing with problems at the individual level.": 1,
    "And you know what?": 1,
    "It doesn't work.": 1,
    " Alexander Solzhenitsyn says a line between good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.": 1,
    "That means that line is not out there.": 1,
    "That's a decision that you have to make.": 1,
    "That's a personal thing.": 1,
    "So I want to end very quickly on a positive note.": 1,
    "Heroism as the antidote to evil.": 1,
    " By promoting the heroic imagination, especially in our kids, in our educational system, we want kids to think, I'm a hero in waiting, waiting for the right situation to come along and I will act heroically.": 1,
    " My whole life is not going to focus away from evil that I've been in since I was a kid to understanding heroes.": 1,
    "The banality of heroism is ordinary people who do heroic deeds.": 1,
    " It's the counterpoint to Hannah Arendt's banality of evil.": 1,
    "Our traditional societal heroes are wrong because they are the exception.": 1,
    "They organize their whole life around this.": 1,
    "That's why we know their names.": 1,
    "And our kids heroes are also wrong models for them because they have supernatural talents.": 1,
    " We want our kids to realize most heroes are everyday people, and the heroic act is unusual.": 1,
    "This is Joe Darby.": 1,
    "He was the one that stopped those abuses you saw, because when he saw those images, he turned them over to senior investigating officers.": 1,
    "He was a low-level private.": 1,
    " And that stopped it.": 1,
    "Was he a hero?": 1,
    "No.": 1,
    "They had to put him in hiding because people wanted to kill him and then his mother and his wife.": 1,
    "For three years they were in hiding.": 1,
    "This is the woman who stopped the Stanford Prison Study.": 1,
    " And I said it got out of control.": 1,
    "I was a prison superintendent.": 1,
    "I didn't know it was out of control.": 1,
    "I was totally indifferent.": 1,
    "She came down, saw that madhouse, and said, you know what?": 1,
    "It's terrible what you're doing to those boys.": 1,
    "They're not prisoners.": 1,
    "They're not guards.": 1,
    "They're boys, and you are responsible.": 1,
    " And I ended the study the next day.": 1,
    "The good news is I'm married for the next year.": 1,
    " I just came to my senses, obviously.": 1,
    "So situations have the power to do, but the point is, the same situation.": 1,
    " that can inflame the hostile imagination some of us that makes us perpetrators of evil, can inspire the heroic imagination of others.": 1,
    "It's the same situation, and you're on one side or the other.": 1,
    " Most people are guilty of the evil of inaction because your mother says don't get involved Mind your own business and you have to say mama humanity is my business.": 1,
    "So it's that college of heroism is we're gonna end in a moment": 1,
    " How do we encourage children in new hero courses, that I'm working with Matt Langdon, he has a hero workshop, to develop this heroic imagination, self labeling, I am a hero in waiting, and teach them skills.": 1,
    "To be a hero you have to learn to be a deviant.": 1,
    " You're always going against the conformity of the group.": 1,
    " Heroes are ordinary people whose social action is extraordinary, who act.": 1,
    "The key to heroes are two things.": 1,
    "You have to act when other people are passive.": 1,
    "B, you have to act sociocentrically, not egocentrically.": 1,
    " And I want to end with the story that some of you know about Wesley Autry, New York subway hero, 50-year-old African-American construction worker.": 1,
    "He's standing on a subway in New York.": 1,
    "A white guy falls on the tracks.": 1,
    "The subway train is coming.": 1,
    "There are 75 people there.": 1,
    "You know what?": 1,
    "They freeze.": 1,
    " He's got a reason not to get involved.": 1,
    "He's black, the guy's white, and he's got two little kids.": 1,
    "Instead, he gives his kids a stranger, jumps on the tracks, puts the guy between the tracks, lays on him, the subway goes over him.": 1,
    " Wesley and the guy, 20 and a half inches height.": 1,
    "The train clearance is 21 inches.": 1,
    "A half an inch would have taken his head off.": 1,
    " And he said, I did what anyone could do, no big deal to jump in the tracks.": 1,
    "And the moral imperative is, I did what everyone should do.": 1,
    "And so one day, you will be in a new situation.": 1,
    " Take path one, you're going to be a perpetrator of evil.": 1,
    "Evil meaning you're going to be Arthur Anderson, you're going to cheat, you're going to allow bullying.": 1,
    "Path two, you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction.": 1,
    "Path three, you become a hero.": 1,
    " The point is, are we ready to take the path to celebrating ordinary heroes, waiting for the right situation to come along to put heroic imagination into action?": 1,
    " because it may only happen once in your life.": 1,
    "When you pass it by, you'll always know I could have been a hero and I let it pass me by.": 1,
    "So the point is thinking it and then doing it.": 1,
    " So I want to thank you, thank you, thank you.": 1,
    "Let's oppose the power of evil systems at home and abroad, and let's focus on the positive.": 1,
    "Advocate for respect and personal dignity, for justice and peace, which sadly our administration has not been doing.": 1,
    "Thanks so much.": 1,
    " Thank you": 1
