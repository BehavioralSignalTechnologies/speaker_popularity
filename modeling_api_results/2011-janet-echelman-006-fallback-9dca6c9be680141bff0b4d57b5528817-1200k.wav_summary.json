    " This story is about taking imagination seriously.": 1,
    "14 years ago, I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet, used the same way for centuries.": 1,
    " Today, I'm using it to create permanent, billowing, voluptuous forms the scale of hard-edged buildings in cities around the world.": 1,
    " I was an unlikely person to be doing this.": 1,
    "I never studied sculpture, engineering, or architecture.": 1,
    "In fact, after college, I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven.": 1,
    " I went off on my own to become an artist, and I painted for 10 years when I was offered a Fulbright to India.": 1,
    " Promising to give exhibitions of paintings, I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram.": 1,
    "The deadline for the show arrived.": 1,
    "My paints didn't.": 1,
    " I had to do something.": 1,
    "This fishing village was famous for sculpture, so I tried bronze casting.": 1,
    "But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive.": 1,
    " I went for a walk on the beach, watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand.": 1,
    "I'd seen it every day, but this time I saw it differently.": 1,
    " a new approach to sculpture, a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials.": 1,
    " My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen.": 1,
    "It's a self-portrait titled, Wide Hips.": 1,
    " we hoisted them on poles to photograph.": 1,
    " I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns.": 1,
    "I was mesmerized.": 1,
    " I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans, next in Lithuania with lace makers.": 1,
    "I liked the fine detail it gave my work.": 1,
    " But I wanted to make them larger, to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in.": 1,
    "Returning to India to work with those fishermen, we made a net of a million and a half hand-tied knots.": 1,
    " Installed briefly in Madrid, thousands of people saw it, and one of them was the urbanist Manuel Solomorales, who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto, Portugal.": 1,
    " He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city.": 1,
    "I didn't know if I could do that and preserve my art, durable,": 1,
    " engineered, permanent.": 1,
    "Those are in opposition to idiosyncratic, delicate, and ephemeral.": 1,
    " For two years, I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays, salt, air, pollution, and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind.": 1,
    " We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle.": 1,
    "So we raised this 45,000 pound steel ring.": 1,
    " We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds.": 1,
    "But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving.": 1,
    " I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designed sails for America's Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel.": 1,
    " He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape.": 1,
    " and gentle movement.": 1,
    " I couldn't build this the way I knew because hand-tied knots weren't going to withstand a hurricane.": 1,
    "So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory, learned the variables of their machines, and figured out a way to make lace with them.": 1,
    " There was no language to translate this ancient idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce.": 1,
    "So we had to create one.": 1,
    "Three years and two children later.": 1,
    " we raised this 50,000 square foot lace net.": 1,
    "It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built, permanent, and had lost nothing in translation.": 1,
    " This intersection had been bland and anonymous.": 1,
    "Now it had a sense of place.": 1,
    " I walked underneath it for the first time.": 1,
    "As I watched the wind's choreography unfold, I felt sheltered and at the same time connected to limitless sky.": 1,
    " My life was not going to be the same.": 1,
    " Come on.": 1,
    " I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world.": 1,
    "I'm going to share two directions that are new in my work.": 1,
    " historic Philadelphia City Hall.": 1,
    "Its plaza I felt needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting.": 1,
    " So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind.": 1,
    " and in testing discovered it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet.": 1,
    "I'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time.": 1,
    " like an X-ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding.": 1,
    " Next challenge, the biennial of the Americas in Denver asked, could I represent the 35 nations of the Western Hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture?": 1,
    " I didn't know where to begin, but I said yes.": 1,
    "I read about the recent earthquake in Chile.": 1,
    " and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean.": 1,
    "It shifted the Earth's tectonic plates, sped up the planet's rotation, and literally shortened the length of the day.": 1,
    " So I contacted NOAA and I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami and translated it into this.": 1,
    " Its title, 1.26, refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth's day was shortened.": 1,
    " I couldn't build this with a steel ring the way I knew.": 1,
    "Its shape was too complex now.": 1,
    "So I replaced the metal armature with a soft, fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel.": 1,
    " the sculpture could now be entirely soft, which made it so light it could tie into existing buildings.": 1,
    " literally becoming part of the fabric of the city.": 1,
    "There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity, so we had to create it.": 1,
    " Then I got a call from New York City.": 1,
    " asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line.": 1,
    " This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers.": 1,
    " They don't have funding yet, but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they're most needed.": 1,
    " 14 years ago, I searched for beauty.": 1,
    " in the traditional things, in craft forms.": 1,
    " Now I combine them with high-tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous billowing forms the scale of buildings.": 1,
    " My artistic horizons continue to grow.": 1,
    "I'll leave you with this story.": 1,
    "I got a call from a friend in Phoenix.": 1,
    " an attorney in the office who'd never been interested in art, never visited the local art museum.": 1,
    " dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture.": 1,
    "There they were in their business suits, lying in the grass, noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they didn't know.": 1,
    " sharing the rediscovery of wonder.": 1
