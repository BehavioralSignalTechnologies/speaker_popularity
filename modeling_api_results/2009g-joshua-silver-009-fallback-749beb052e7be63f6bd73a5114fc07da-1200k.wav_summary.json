    "How do you solve this problem?": 2,
    " I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems and how it can be solved.": 1,
    "I'd like to start": 1,
    " With a little experiment, could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses or you've had laser refractive surgery?": 1,
    " Unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly, but it looks like I'm guessing that it'll be about 60% of the room because that's roughly the fraction.": 1,
    " of a developed world population that have some sort of vision correction.": 1,
    " The World Health Organisation estimates, well they make various estimates of the number of people that need glasses, their lowest estimate is 150 million people.": 1,
    " They also have an estimate of around a billion.": 1,
    "But in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear": 1,
    " is around half of any population.": 1,
    "And the problem of poor vision is actually not just a health problem, it's also an educational problem": 1,
    " And it's an economic problem and it's a quality of life problem.": 1,
    "Glasses are not very expensive, they're quite plentiful.": 1,
    " The problem is that there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world.": 1,
    " There are just way too few eye care professionals.": 1,
    "So this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that's the ratio in the UK.": 1,
    " This is the ratio of optometrists to people in Sub-Saharan Africa.": 1,
    "In fact, there are some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population.": 1,
    " How do you do this?": 1,
    "I came up with a solution to this problem and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this and the idea is you make eyeglasses and you adjust them yourself": 1,
    " and that solves the problem.": 1,
    "What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses, and I shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses.": 1,
    "I shall pop this in my pocket.": 1,
    " I'm short-sighted.": 1,
    "I look at these signs at the end, I can hardly see them.": 1,
    "So, okay, I can now see that man running out there.": 1,
    " And I can see that guy running out there.": 1,
    "I've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription.": 1,
    " Next step in my process, so I've now made eyeglasses to my prescription.": 1,
    " Okay, so I've made these glasses and": 1,
    " Okay, I've made the glasses to my prescription.": 1,
    " I've just...": 1,
    " There we are.": 1,
    " And I've now made some glasses.": 1,
    "That's it.": 1,
    " Now, these aren't the only pair in the world.": 1,
    "In fact, this technology has been evolving.": 1,
    "I started working on it in 1985, and it's been evolving very slowly.": 1,
    " There are about 30,000 in use now and they're in 15 countries and they're spread around the world.": 1,
    " And I have a vision, which I'll share with you.": 1,
    "I have a global vision for vision.": 1,
    "And that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020.": 1,
    " To do that, this is an early example of the technology.": 1,
    "The technology is being further developed.": 1,
    "The cost has to be brought down.": 1,
    "This pair, in fact, these currently cost about $19, but the cost has to be brought right down.": 1,
    " It has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day.": 1,
    "You start to get into detail and on this slide I'm": 1,
    " basically explaining all the problems that you have.": 1,
    "How do you distribute?": 1,
    "How do you work out how to fit the thing?": 1,
    "How do you have people realising that they have a vision problem?": 1,
    "How do you deal with the industry?": 1,
    "And the answer to that is": 1,
    " research.": 1,
    "What we've done is to set up the Centre for Vision in the developing world here in the University.": 1,
    "If you want to know more, just come and have a look at our website.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
