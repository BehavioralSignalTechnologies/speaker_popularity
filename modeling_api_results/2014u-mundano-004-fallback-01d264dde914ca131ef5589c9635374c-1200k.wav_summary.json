    " Our world has many superheroes, but they have the worst of all superpowers.": 1,
    "Invisibility.": 1,
    "For example, the catadores, workers who collect recyclable materials for a living.": 1,
    " Catadores emerged from social inequality, unemployment and the abundance of solid waste from the deficiency of the waste collection system.": 1,
    " Katador is provider, heavy, honest.": 1,
    " an essential work that benefits the entire population, but they are not acknowledged for it.": 1,
    "Here in Brazil, they collect 90% of all the waste that's actually recycled.": 1,
    " Most of the catadores work independently.": 1,
    " picking waste on the streets and selling to junkyards at very low prices.": 1,
    "They may collect over 300 kilos in their bags, shopping carts, bicycles and carrosas.": 1,
    " Carrossas are cards built from wood or metal and found in several streets in Brazil, much like graffiti and street art.": 1,
    "And this is how I first met these marginalized superheroes.": 1,
    " I am a graffiti artist and activist, and my art is social, environmental, and political in nature.": 1,
    " In 2007, I took my work beyond walls and onto the carrosas as a new urban support for my message.": 1,
    "But at this time, giving voice to the catadores.": 1,
    " By adding art and humor to the cause, it became more appealing, which helped to call attention to the catadores and improve their self-esteem.": 1,
    "And also, they are famous now on the streets, on mass media and social.": 1,
    " So, the thing is, I plunged into this universe and have not stopped working since.": 1,
    "I have painted over 200 Carrossas in many cities and been invited to do exhibitions and trips worldwide.": 1,
    " And then I realized that catadores and their invisibility are not exclusive to Brazil.": 1,
    "I met them in Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, South Africa.": 1,
    " Turkey and even developed countries such as the United States and Japan.": 1,
    " And this was when I realized that I need to have more people join the cause, because it's a big challenge.": 1,
    "And then I created a collaborative movement called Peep My Carossa.": 1,
    " with a large crowdfunding event.": 1,
    " So Peep My Carro\u00e7a is a large crowdfunding event to help catadores and their carrosas.": 1,
    "Catadores are assisted by well-being professionals and healthcare like physicians, dentists...": 1,
    " podiatrists, hairstylists, and massage therapists, and much more.": 1,
    "But also they received safety shirts.": 1,
    " and eyeglasses to see in high definition the city.": 1,
    " volunteers, and then received safety items too, reflective tapes, horns and mirrors.": 1,
    "Then, finally, painted by a street artist and become part of this huge, amazing mobile art exhibition.": 1,
    " Pip Maica Ro\u00e7a took the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Curitiba.": 1,
    "But to meet the demand in other cities, including outside of Brazil, we have created Pimpaks,": 1,
    " which is inspired by TEDx, and it's a simplified, do-it-yourself, crowdfunding edition of Pimp Micahoss.": 1,
    "So now everybody can join.": 1,
    " In two years, over 170 catadores, 800 volunteers, and 200 sit-artists, and more than 1,000 donators have been involved in the Peep My Carro\u00e7a movement.": 1,
    " whose actions have even been used teaching recycling at a local school.": 1,
    " So catadores are leaving invisibility behind and become increasingly respected and valued.": 1,
    " Because of their pimps carrosas, they are able to fight back.": 1,
    "Prejudice increases their income and their interaction with society.": 1,
    "So now,": 1,
    " I'd like to challenge you to start looking at and acknowledge the catadores and other invisible superheroes from your city.": 1,
    "Try to see the world as one.": 1,
    " without boundaries or frontiers.": 1,
    "Believe it or not, there are over 20 million catadores worldwide.": 1,
    " So next time you see one, recognize them as a vital part of our society.": 1,
    "Muito obrigado.": 1
