    " The year is 1800.": 1,
    "A curious little invention is being talked about.": 1,
    "It's called a microscope.": 1,
    " What it allows you to do is see tiny little life forms that are invisible to the naked eye.": 1,
    "Soon comes a medical discovery that many of these life forms are actually causes of terrible human diseases.": 1,
    " Imagine what happened to the society when they realized that an English mom in her teacup actually was drinking a monster soup.": 1,
    " not very far from here, this is from London.": 1,
    "Fast forward 200 years, we still have this monster soup around, and it's taken hold in the developing countries around the tropical belt.": 1,
    " Just for malaria itself, there are a million deaths a year and more than a billion people that need to be tested because they are at risk for different species of malaria and infections.": 1,
    " Now, it's actually very simple to put a face to many of these monsters.": 1,
    "You take a stain, like an acrid in orange, or a fluorescent stain, or gymsa, and a microscope, and you look at them.": 1,
    "They all have faces.": 1,
    " Why is that so?": 1,
    "That Alex in Kenya, Fatima in Bangladesh, Navjot in Mumbai, and Julie and Mary in Uganda still wait months to be able to diagnose why they are sick.": 1,
    " And that's primarily because of scalability of this diagnostics is completely out of reach.": 1,
    "And remember that number, one billion.": 1,
    " The problem lies with the microscope itself.": 1,
    " Even though the pinnacle of modern science, research microscopes are not designed for field testing, neither were they first designed for diagnostics at all.": 1,
    "They're heavy, bulky, really hard to maintain, and cost a lot of money.": 1,
    " This picture is Mahatma Gandhi in the 40s using the exact same setup that we actually use today for diagnosing TB in his ashram in Sevagram in India.": 1,
    " Two of my students, Jim and James, traveled around India and Thailand, starting to think about this problem a lot.": 1,
    " We saw all kinds of donated equipment.": 1,
    "We saw fungus growing on microscope lenses.": 1,
    "And we saw people who had a functional microscope but just didn't know how to even turn it on.": 1,
    " What grew out of that work and that trip was actually the idea of what we call fold scopes.": 1,
    "So what is a fold scope?": 1,
    "A fold scope is a completely functional microscope.": 1,
    " a platform for fluorescence, bright field, polarization, projection, all kinds of advanced microscopy built purely by folding paper.": 1,
    " So now you think, how is that possible?": 1,
    "I'm going to show you some examples here, and we'll run through some of them.": 1,
    "It starts with a single sheet of paper.": 1,
    " What you see here is all the possible components to build a functional bright field and fluorescence microscope.": 1,
    " So there are three stages.": 1,
    "There is the optical stage, the illumination stage, and the mask-holding stage.": 1,
    "And there are micro-optics at the bottom that's actually embedded in the paper itself.": 1,
    " What you do is you take it on and just like you were playing like a toy, which it is,": 1,
    " I tab it off.": 1,
    " and I break it off.": 1,
    " This paper has no instructions and no languages.": 1,
    "There is a color code embedded that tells you exactly how to fold that specific microscope.": 1,
    " When it's done, it looks something like this, has all the functionalities of a standard microscope, just like an XY stage, a place where a sample slide could go.": 1,
    " for example right here.": 1,
    "We didn't want to change this because this is the standard that's been optimized for over the years and many health workers are actually used to this.": 1,
    "So this is what changes but the standard stains all remain the same for many different diseases.": 1,
    " You pop this in.": 1,
    " There is an XY stage.": 1,
    " And then there is a focusing stage, which is a flexure mechanism that's built in paper itself that allows us to move and focus the lenses by micron steps.": 1,
    " So, what's really interesting about this object, and my students hate when I do this, but I'm going to do this anyway, is these are rugged devices.": 1,
    "I can turn it on and throw it on the floor.": 1,
    " and really try to stomp on it.": 1,
    " And they last, even though they're designed from a very flexible material like paper.": 1,
    "Another fun fact is this is what we actually send out there as a standard diagnostic tool.": 1,
    " But here in this envelope, I have 30 different fold scopes of different configurations all in a single folder.": 1,
    " And I'm going to pick one randomly.": 1,
    "This one turns out is actually designed specifically for malaria because it has the fluorescent filters built specifically for diagnosing malaria.": 1,
    "So the idea of very specific diagnostic microscopes comes out of this.": 1,
    " So up till now, you didn't actually see what I would see from one of these setups.": 1,
    "So what I would like to do is, if we could dim the lights, please.": 1,
    " It turns out fold scopes are also projection microscopes.": 1,
    "I have these two microscopes that I'm going to turn, go to the back of the wall and just project and this way you would see exactly what I would see.": 1,
    "What you're looking at": 1,
    " This is a cross-section of a compound eye.": 1,
    "And when I'm going to zoom in closer, right there, I'm going through the z-axis.": 1,
    "You actually see how the lenses are cut together.": 1,
    " in the cross-section pattern.": 1,
    "Another example, one of my favorite insects, I love to hate this one, is a mosquito.": 1,
    "And you're seeing the antenna of a Culex pipens right there.": 1,
    " all from the simple setup that I actually described.": 1,
    " So my wife has been field testing some of our microscopes by washing my clothes whenever I forget them in the dryer.": 1,
    "So it turns out they're waterproof.": 1,
    " Right here is just fluorescein water.": 1,
    "And I don't know if you can actually see this.": 1,
    "This also shows you how the projection scope works.": 1,
    "You get to see the beam the way it's projected and bent.": 1,
    " Can we get the lights back on again?": 1,
    " So I'm quickly going to show you, since I'm running out of time, in terms of how much it costs for us to manufacture, the biggest idea was role-to-role manufacturing.": 1,
    "So we built this out of 50 cents of parts and costs.": 1,
    " And what this allows us to do is think about a new paradigm in microscopy, which we call use and throw microscopy.": 1,
    "I'm going to give you a quick snapshot of some of the parts that go in.": 1,
    "Here is a sheet of paper.": 1,
    "This is when we were thinking about the idea.": 1,
    "This is an A4 sheet of paper.": 1,
    " These are the three stages that you actually see.": 1,
    "And the optical components, if you look at the inset up on the right, we had to figure out a way to manufacture lenses in paper itself at really high throughputs.": 1,
    "So it uses a process of self-assembly and surface tension": 1,
    " to build achromatic lenses in the paper itself.": 1,
    "So that's where the lenses go.": 1,
    "There are some light sources.": 1,
    "And essentially, in the end, all the parts line up because of origami.": 1,
    "Because of the fact that origami allows us": 1,
    " micron scale precision of optical alignment.": 1,
    "So even though this looks like a simple toy, the aspects of engineering that go in something like this are fairly sophisticated.": 1,
    " So here is another obvious thing that we would do typically if I was going to show that these microscopes are robust, is go to the third floor and drop it from the floor itself.": 1,
    "There it is, and it survives.": 1,
    " So for us, the next step actually is really finishing our field trials.": 1,
    "We're starting at the end of the summer.": 1,
    "We are at a stage where we'll be making thousands of microscopes.": 1,
    "That would be the first time.": 1,
    " where we would be doing field trials with the highest density of microscopes ever at a given took place.": 1,
    "We've started collecting data for malaria, Chagas disease, and Gerardia from patients itself.": 1,
    " And I want to leave you with this picture.": 1,
    "I had not anticipated this before, but a really interesting link between hands-on science education and global health.": 1,
    " What are the tools that we are actually providing the kids who are going to fight this monster soup for tomorrow?": 1,
    "I would love for them to be able to just print out a full scope and carry them around in their pockets.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
