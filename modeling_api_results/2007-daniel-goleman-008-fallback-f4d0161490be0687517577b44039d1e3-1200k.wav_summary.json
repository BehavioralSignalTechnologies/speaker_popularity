    " collateral thinking, if you will, about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal.": 1,
    "I'm a psychologist, but rest assured I will not bring it to the scrotal.": 1,
    " There was a very important study done a while ago at Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is that when all of us have so many opportunities to help, we do sometimes and we don't other times.": 1,
    " A group of divinity students at the Princeton Theological Seminary": 1,
    " were told that they're going to give a practice sermon and they were each given a sermon topic half of those students were given as a topic the parable of the good samaritan the man who stopped the stranger in": 1,
    " to help the stranger in need by the side of the road.": 1,
    "Half were given random Bible topics.": 1,
    "Then one by one they're told they had to go to another building.": 1,
    " and give their sermon.": 1,
    "As they went from the first building to the second, each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning, clearly in need.": 1,
    "The question is, did they stop to help?": 1,
    " The more interesting question is, did it matter they were contemplating the parable of the Good Samaritan?": 1,
    "Answer, no, not at all.": 1,
    " What turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in.": 1,
    "Were they feeling they were late?": 1,
    "Or were they absorbed": 1,
    " in what they're going to talk about.": 1,
    "And this is, I think, the predicament of our lives, that we don't take every opportunity to help": 1,
    " because our focus is in the wrong direction.": 1,
    "There's a new field in brain science, social neuroscience, that studies the circuitry": 1,
    " in two people's brains that activates while they interact.": 1,
    "And the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience is that our default wiring is to help.": 1,
    "That is to say,": 1,
    " If we attend to the other person, we automatically empathize, we automatically feel with them.": 1,
    "They're these newly identified neurons, mirror neurons that act like a neural Wi-Fi.": 1,
    " activating in our brain exactly the areas activated in theirs.": 1,
    "We feel with automatically.": 1,
    "And if that person is in need, if that person is suffering, we're automatically prepared to help.": 1,
    "At least that's the argument.": 1,
    " But then the question is, why don't we?": 1,
    "And I think this speaks to a spectrum that goes from complete self-absorption": 1,
    " to noticing, to empathy, and to compassion.": 1,
    "And the simple fact is if we are focused on ourselves, if we're preoccupied as we so often are throughout the day,": 1,
    " we don't really fully notice the other.": 1,
    "And this difference between the self and the other focus can be very subtle.": 1,
    "I was doing my": 1,
    " Taxes the other day and I got to the point where I was listing all of the donations I gave and I had an epiphany It was I came to my check to the save a foundation and I noticed that I thought boy My friend Larry brilliant would really be happy that I gave money to save him": 1,
    " Then I realized that what I was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit that I felt good about myself.": 1,
    "Then I started to think about the people in the Himalayas whose cataracts would be helped, and I realized": 1,
    " that I went from this kind of narcissistic self-focus to altruistic joy, to feeling good for the people that were being helped.": 1,
    " I think that's a motivator, but this distinction between focusing on ourselves and focusing on others is one that I encourage us all to pay attention to.": 1,
    "You can see it in a gross level in the world of dating.": 1,
    "I was at a sushi restaurant.": 1,

    "I don't know if you know speed dating.": 1,
    "Women sit at tables": 1,
    " and men go from table to table, and there's a clock and a bell in it.": 1,
    "Five minutes, bingo.": 1,
    " The conversation ends and the woman can decide whether to give her card or her email address to the man for follow-up.": 1,
    "This woman says, my brother's never gotten a card and I know exactly why.": 1,

    "I came to the marriage of Alice": 1,
    " Charney Epstein.": 1,
    "And she said that when she was in the dating scene, she had a simple test she put people to.": 1,
    " The test was, from the moment they got together, how long did it take the guy to ask her a question with the word you in it?": 1,
    "And apparently Epstein aced the test.": 1,
    "Therefore, the article.": 1,
    " Now, it's a little test I encourage you to try out at a party.": 1,
    "Here at TED, there's great opportunities.": 1,
    " The Harvard Business Review recently had an article called The Human Moment about how to make real contact with a person at work.": 1,
    "And they said, well, the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry, close your laptop,": 1,
    " There is a newly coined word in the English language": 1,
    " for the moment when the person whips out their Blackberry or answers that cell phone and all of a sudden we don't exist.": 1,
    "The word is puzzled.": 1,
    "It's a combination of puzzled and pissed off.": 1,
    " I think it's quite apt.": 1,
    " It's our empathy, it's our tuning in, which separates us from Machiavellians or sociopaths.": 1,
    " Brother-in-law, who's an expert on horror and terror, he wrote the annotated Dracula, the essential Frankenstein.": 1,
    "He was trained as a Chaucer scholar, but he was born in Transylvania, and I think it affected him a little bit.": 1,
    " At any rate, at one point my brother-in-law, Leonard, decided to write a book about a serial killer.": 1,
    "This is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we're in many years ago.": 1,
    "He was known as the Santa Cruz Strangler and before he was arrested he had murdered": 1,
    " his grandparents, his mother, and five coeds at UC Santa Cruz.": 1,
    "So my brother-in-law goes to interview this killer.": 1,
    " And he realizes when he meets him that this guy is absolutely terrifying.": 1,
    "For one thing, he's almost seven feet tall.": 1,
    "But that's not the most terrifying thing about him.": 1,

    " certified genius, but there is zero correlation between IQ and emotional empathy, feeling with the other person.": 1,

    "Didn't you feel any pity for your victims?": 1,
    "These were very intimate murders.": 1,
    "He strangled his victims.": 1,
    " And the strangler says very matter of factly, Oh, no, if I had felt the distress, I could not have done it.": 1,
    "And I think that": 1,
    " That is very troubling, and in a sense, I've been reflecting on turning that part of us off.": 1,
    "When we focus on ourselves in any activity, we do turn that part of ourselves off if there's another person.": 1,
    "Think about going shopping.": 1,

    " manufacturing nutrient can be reused or does it just end up in landfill?": 1,

    "Consider this.": 1,
    "There's a wonderful book called Stuff, The Hidden Life of Everyday Objects.": 1,

    "Once you can track it back to the factory,": 1,
    " you can look at the manufacturing processes that were used to make it.": 1,
    "And if it's virtuous, you can label it that way.": 1,
    " Or if it's not so virtuous, you can go into today, go into any store, put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode, which will take you to a website.": 1,
    "They have it for people with allergies to peanuts.": 1,
    " that website could tell you things about that object.": 1,

    "It was homeless people on the streets.": 1,
    " And I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless.": 1,
    " And I realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go.": 1,
    "They had a diagnosis.": 1,
    "What it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where": 1,
    " When we're passing someone who's homeless in the periphery of our vision, it stays on the periphery.": 1,
    " we don't notice and therefore we don't act.": 1,
    " One day soon after that, it was a Friday, at the end of the day I was going down to the subway, it was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs and all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs I noticed that there was a man": 1,
    " slumped to the side, shirtless, not moving.": 1,
    " And people were just stepping over him, hundreds and hundreds of people.": 1,
    " And because my urban trance had been somehow weakened, I found myself stopping to find out what was wrong.": 1,
    "The moment I stopped, half a dozen other people immediately rang the same guy.": 1,
    " And we found out that he was Hispanic.": 1,
    "He didn't speak any English.": 1,
