    " You can imagine it, you're in a bar and you go to a disco and you start talking and after a while the conversation starts and you're like, what are you working on?": 1,
    " And when you think your work is interesting, you say, I'm a mathematician.": 1,
    " Cuando esa conversaci\u00f3n sigue, invariablemente en alg\u00fan momento aparece una de estas dos frases.": 1,
    "Yo es que era fatal con las matem\u00e1ticas, pero no era culpa m\u00eda, es que el profesor era horroroso.": 1,
    " YB.": 1,
    "\u00bfPero eso de las matem\u00e1ticas para qu\u00e9 sirve?": 1,
    "Me ocupar\u00e9 del caso B.": 1,
    " When someone asks you what mathematics is for, he's not asking you about mathematical science applications.": 1,
    "He's asking you, why did I have to study that shit I never used again?": 1,
    "That's what he's really asking you.": 1,
    " Before this, when a mathematician is asked what mathematics are for, mathematicians divide into groups.": 1,
    "54.51% of mathematicians take an attack position.": 1,
    " And 44.77% of the mathematicians take a defensive position.": 1,
    "There is a weird 0.8% among those who include me.": 1,
    "What are those of the attack?": 1,
    " Los del ataque son matem\u00e1ticos que te dicen que esa pregunta no tiene sentido porque las matem\u00e1ticas tienen un sentido propio, s\u00ed misma son un edificio bell\u00edsimo que tiene una l\u00f3gica propia que se construye.": 1,
    " and that it is not necessary that one is always looking at the possible applications.": 1,
    "What is poetry for?": 1,
    "What is love for?": 1,
    "What is life for?": 1,
    "What kind of question is that?": 1,
    " Hardy, for example, is an exponent of this attack.": 1,
    "And those who are on the defensive tell you that even if you don't realize it, dear, mathematics is behind everything.": 1,
    " These always name the bridges and the computers.": 1,
    "If you don't know math, the bridge will fall.": 1,
    " Really, computers are all mathematics.": 1,
    "Now this has also given them, to tell you that behind computer security, credit cards are the prime numbers.": 1,
    " These are the answers that your math teacher is going to give you if you ask him.": 1,
    "He's one of the defensive ones.": 1,
    "Okay, but who's right?": 1,
    "Those who say that math doesn't have to be useful at all, or those who say that they're really behind everything.": 1,
    " Both of you are right, but I told you that I was that weird 0.8% that says something else, right?": 1,
    "So, ask me what mathematics are for.": 1,
    " 76.34% of the people have asked.": 1,
    "23.41% have been quiet and 0.8%... I don't know what they're doing.": 1,
    "Well, dear 76.31%.": 1,
    " Mathematics is true that they don't have to serve for anything.": 1,
    "It is true that they are a precious building, a logical building, probably one of the greatest collective efforts that the human being has made throughout history.": 1,
    " But it is also true that where scientists and technicians are looking for mathematical theories, models that allow them to advance, they are in the building of mathematics, which permeates everything.": 1,
    " It's true that we have to go deeper.": 1,
    "Let's see what's behind the sciences.": 1,
    "Science works by intuition, by creativity, and mathematics dominates intuition and dominates creativity.": 1,
    " A casi todo el mundo que no lo ha o\u00eddo antes le sorprende que si uno cogiera una hoja de papel de 0,1 mil\u00edmetros de grosor, esas que utilizamos normalmente, lo suficientemente grande y la pudiera doblar 50 veces, el grosor de ese mont\u00f3n": 1,
    " occupying the distance from the Earth to the Sun.": 1,
    " Your intuition tells you that is impossible.": 1,
    "Count it and you will see that it is.": 1,
    "That is what mathematics is for.": 1,
    " It's true that science, all science, only makes sense because it makes us better understand this beautiful world in which we are, and because it helps us.": 1,
    " to sort out the traps of this painful world in which we are.": 1,
    "There are sciences that touch that application with their hands.": 1,
    "Oncological science, for example.": 1,
    "And there are others that we look at from afar, with envy sometimes, but knowing that we are their support.": 1,
    " All the basic sciences are the support of those, including mathematics.": 1,
    " Everything science does is science.": 1,
    "It is the rigor of mathematics.": 1,
    "And that rigor comes to them because their results are eternal.": 1,
    " You've probably been told that a diamond is forever, right?": 1,
    " Well, it depends on what you understand forever.": 1,
    "A theorem, that's for ever.": 1,
    " The Pythagorean Theorem.": 1,
    "The Pythagorean Theorem, that's true even if Pythagoras died, I'm telling you.": 1,
    "Even if the world sinks, the Pythagorean Theorem would still be true.": 1,
    "Wherever a couple of cathets and a good hypotenuse come together,": 1,
    " The Pythagorean theorem works perfectly.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " Well, mathematicians are dedicated to making theorems, eternal truths.": 1,
    "But it's not always easy to know what an eternal truth is, a theorem, and what a mere conjecture is.": 1,
    "We need a demonstration.": 1,
    " Por ejemplo, imaginaos que tengo aqu\u00ed un campo grande, enorme, infinito.": 1,
    "Lo quiero cubrir con piezas iguales, sin dejar huecos.": 1,
    "Podr\u00eda usar cuadrados, \u00bfverdad?": 1,
    " Could you draw triangles?": 1,
    "Circles, no.": 1,
    "They leave little holes.": 1,
    " What is the best piece that I can use?": 1,
    "The one that covers the same surface and has a smaller edge.": 1,
    "Papus of Alexandria, in the year 300, said that the best thing to do was to use hexagons, as bees do.": 1,
    " But he didn't prove it.": 1,
    "The guy said, Esagonos, uh, Lopeta, come on, Esagonos, give it to me.": 1,
    "He didn't prove it.": 1,
    "He stayed in a conjecture.": 1,
    "He said, Esagonos.": 1,
    " The world, as you know, was divided between papists and anti-papists until 1700 years later, in 1999, Thomas Hales": 1,
    " he proved that poppies and bees were right, that the best thing is to use hexagons.": 1,
    "And that became a theorem, the panal theorem, which will be true forever and ever, more than any diamond you have.": 1,
    " But what happens if we go to three dimensions?": 1,
    "If I want to fill the space with equal pieces, without leaving gaps, I can use cubes, right?": 1,
    "Not spheres, that leave little gaps.": 1,
    " Which is the best piece I can use?": 1,
    "Lord Kelvin.": 1,
    "The one with the Kelvin degrees and all that.": 1,
    "He said the best thing to do was to use a truncated octahedron.": 1,
    " Que como todos sab\u00e9is...": 1,
    " \u00a1Es esto de aqu\u00ed!": 1,
    " Come on.": 1,
    " Who doesn't have a truncated osteoarthritis at home?": 1,
    "Even if it's plastic, baby, bring the truncated osteoarthritis, there are visitors.": 1,
    "Everyone has it.": 1,
    "But Kelvin didn't prove it.": 1,
    "He stayed in a conjecture, Kelvin's conjecture.": 1,
    " The world, as you know, was divided between Calvinists and anti-Calvinists.": 1,
    " hasta que ciento y pico a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s": 1,
    " A hundred years later, someone found a better structure.": 1,
    " Weire and F\u00e9lan.": 1,
    "Weire and F\u00e9lan found this little thing here.": 1,
    " Esta estructura a la que pusieron el imaginativo nombre de... Estructura de Weire y Velland.": 1,
    " It seems like a strange thing, but it's not so strange.": 1,
    "It's also present in nature.": 1,
    "It's very, very curious that this structure, due to its geometric properties, was used to build the swimming building in the Olympic Games in Beijing.": 1,
    " There, Michael Phelps won eight gold medals.": 1,
    "He became the best swimmer of all time.": 1,
    "Well, of all time, until another better one comes out, right?": 1,
    "What's wrong with the structure of Wade and Phelan?": 1,
    "It's the best until another better one comes out.": 1,
    " But be careful.": 1,
    " Because this does have the opportunity, that even if it's more than a hundred years, even if it's within 1,700 years, someone should prove that this is the best piece possible.": 1,
    " And then it will be a theorem, a truth forever and ever, more than any diamond.": 1,
    " So, well, if you want to tell someone...": 1,
    " Que le quer\u00e9is para siempre.": 1,
    " You can give him a diamond.": 1,
    "But if you want to tell him that you love him forever, give him a theorem.": 1,
    " That's right.": 1,
    "Quiet.": 1,
    "You'll have to prove that your love doesn't stay in conjecture.": 1
