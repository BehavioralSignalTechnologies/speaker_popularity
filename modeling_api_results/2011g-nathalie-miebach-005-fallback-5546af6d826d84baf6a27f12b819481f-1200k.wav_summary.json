    " I'm sorry.": 1,
    " What you just heard are the interactions of barometric pressure wind and temperature readings that were recorded of Hurricane Noel in 2007.": 1,
    " The musicians played off a three-dimensional graph of weather data like this.": 1,
    "Every single beat, every single colored band represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note.": 1,
    " I find weather extremely fascinating.": 1,
    "Weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us.": 1,
    "So I use sculpture and music to make it not just visible, but also tactile and audible.": 1,
    " All of my work begins very simple.": 1,
    "I extract information from a specific environment using very low tech data collecting devices, generally anything I can find in the hardware store.": 1,
    " I then compare my information to things I find on the internet.": 1,
    "Satellite images, weather data from weather stations as well as offshore buoys.": 1,
    "That's both historical as well as real data.": 1,
    "And then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here.": 1,
    " These clipboards are filled with numbers.": 1,
    "And from all of these numbers, I start with only two or three variables.": 1,
    "That begins my translation process.": 1,
    " My translation medium is a very simple basket.": 1,
    "A basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements.": 1,
    "When I assign values to the horizontal and vertical elements, I can use the changes of those data points over time to create the form.": 1,
    " I use natural read because natural read has a lot of tension in it that I cannot fully control.": 1,
    "That means that it is the numbers that control the form, not me.": 1,
    " What I come up with are forms like these.": 1,
    "These forms are completely made up of weather data or science data.": 1,
    "Every colored bead, every colored string represents a weather element.": 1,
    " And together these variables not only construct the form, but they also reveal behavioral relationships that may not come across through a two-dimensional graph.": 1,
    " When you step closer, you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers.": 1,
    "The vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day, so all the way around you have a 24-hour timeline, but it's also used to assign a temperature range.": 1,
    " On that grid, I can then weave the high tide readings, water temperature, air temperature and moon phases.": 1,
    "I also translate weather data into musical scores, and musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it.": 1,
    " So, all of these scores are made up of weather data.": 1,
    "Every single color dot, every single line is a weather element, and together these variables construct the score.": 1,
    " I use these scores to collaborate with musicians.": 1,
    "This is the 1913 Trio performing one of my pieces at the Milwaukee Art Museum.": 1,
    " Meanwhile, I use these scores as blue plants to translate into sculptural forms like this that function still in the sense of being a three-dimensional weather data visualization, but now they are": 1,
    " embedding the visual matrix of the musical score so it can actually be read as a musical score.": 1,
    "What I love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art versus science.": 1,
    " This piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it.": 1,
    "You place it in an art museum, it becomes a sculpture.": 1,
    "You place it in a science museum, it becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data.": 1,
    "You place it in a musical, it all of a sudden becomes a musical score.": 1,
    " And I really like that because the viewer is really challenged as to what visual language is part of science versus art versus music.": 1,
    " The other reason I really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point into the complexity of science.": 1,
    "And not everyone has a PhD in science, so for me that was my way into it.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
