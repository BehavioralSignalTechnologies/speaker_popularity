    " that this meeting was planned on the slogan,": 1,
    " illustrating still, which of course I'm not agreeing with because although I am 94, I'm not still working and anybody": 1,
    " Who asks me, are you still doing this or that?": 1,
    "I don't answer.": 1,
    "Because I'm not doing things still.": 1,
    "I'm doing it like I always did.": 1,
    "I still have.": 1,
    " Or did I use the word still?": 1,
    "I didn't mean that.": 1,
    " I have my file which is called To Do.": 1,
    "I have my plans.": 1,
    "I have my clients.": 1,
    "I'm doing my work like I always did.": 1,
    " So this takes care of my age.": 1,
    " I want to show you my work so you know what I am doing and why I am here.": 1,
    "This was about 1925.": 1,
    " All of these things were made during the last...": 1,
    " 75 years.": 1,
    " Well, of course, I'm working since 25 doing more or less what you see here.": 1,
    "This is Castleton, which was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.": 1,
    " This is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum.": 1,
    "This is still at the Metropolitan Museum, now for sale.": 1,
    " This is a portrait of my daughter and myself.": 1,
    " These were some of the things I made.": 1,
    "I made hundreds of them for the last 75 years.": 1,
    " I call myself a maker of things.": 1,
    "I don't call myself an industrial designer.": 1,
    " Because, among other things, industrial designers want to make novel things.": 1,
    "Novelty is a concept of commerce, not a": 1,
    " aesthetic concept.": 1,
    "The industrial design magazine, I believe, is called innovation.": 1,
    "Innovation is not part of the aim of my work.": 1,
    " Well, makers of things.": 1,
    "They make things more beautiful, more elegant.": 1,
    " more comfortable than just a craftsman, too.": 1,
    "I have so much to say, I have to think about what I'm going to say.": 1,
    " Well, to describe our profession otherwise, we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty.": 1,
    " That means the Preface to Beauty was called the first activity of man.": 1,
    " Cyril Smith, who was a Mathematic Professor at MIT, wrote that playful search for beauty was men's first activity.": 1,
    " that all useful qualities and all material qualities were developed from the playful search for beauty.": 1,
    "These are tiles.": 1,
    " The word glyph is a necessary aspect of our work because actually one of our problems is that we have to": 1,
    " make, produce lovely things.": 1,
    " throughout all of life.": 1,
    "And this for me is now 75 years.": 1,
    "So how can you without drying up?": 1,
    " make things with the same pleasure as a gift to others.": 1,
    " for so long.": 1,
    "The play is therefore an important part of our": 1,
    " quality as designer.": 1,
    " Let me tell you some about my life.": 1,
    " As I said, I started to do these things 75 years ago.": 1,
    "My first exhibition": 1,
    " in the United States was at the Saskia Centennial Exhibition in 1926 where the Hungarian government sent one of my hand-drawn": 1,
    " pieces as part of the exhibit.": 1,
    " never actually took me.": 1,
    " through many countries and showed me a great part of the world.": 1,
    "This is not that they took me.": 1,
    "The work didn't take me.": 1,
    " I made the things, particularly because I wanted to use them to see the world.": 1,
    "I was incredibly curious to see the world and I made all these things.": 1,
    " which then finally did take me to see many countries and many cultures.": 1,
    "I started as an apprentice": 1,
    " to a Hungarian.": 1,
    " craftsman.": 1,
    "And this taught me what the guild system was in middle ages.": 1,
    "The guild system": 1,
    " That means when I was an apprentice, I had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master.": 1,
    " In my shop, where I studied or learned, there was": 1,
    " That is enough.": 1,
    " hierarchy of master, journeyman, unlearned worker and apprentice.": 1,
    "And I was the apprentice.": 1,
    " The work as an apprentice was very primitive.": 1,
    "That means I had to actually learn.": 1,
    " every aspect of making pottery by hand.": 1,
    "We must clay with our feet.": 1,
    " When it came from the hillside, after that it had to be kneaded.": 1,
    " Then going kind of a mangle and then finally it was prepared for the throwing.": 1,
    " And there I really worked as an apprentice.": 1,
    "My master took me to set ovens because I was part of this.": 1,
    " of oven making, oven setting in the time.": 1,
    "And finally I had received a document that I had accomplished": 1,
    " my apprenticeship successfully, that I had behaved morally, and this document was given to me by the Guild": 1,
    " of roof coverers, welders, oven setters, chimney sweeps, and potters.": 1,
    " I also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights and my working conditions and I still have that workbook.": 1,
    " First I set up a shop in my own garden and made pottery which I sold on the marketplace in Budapest.": 1,
    "And there I was sitting and": 1,
    " My then boyfriend, I didn't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today, but my boyfriend and I sat at the market and sold the pots.": 1,
    " My mother thought that this was not very proper, so she sat with us.": 1,
    " add propriety to this activity.": 1,
    " However, after a while there was a new factory being built in Budapest, a pottery factory.": 1,
    " large one and I visited it with several ladies and asked all sorts of questions of the director.": 1,
    " Then the director asked me, why did you ask all these questions?": 1,
    "I said, I also have a portrait.": 1,
    " So he asked me could he please visit me and finally he did and explained to me that what I did now in my shop was an anachronism.": 1,
    " that the Industrial Revolution had broken out and that I rather should join the factory where he made an art department for me, where I worked for several months.": 1,
    " However, everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department.": 1,
    "The director, they said there were several women.": 1,
    " casting and producing my designs now in molds and this was sold also to America.": 1,
    "I remember that it was quite successful.": 1,
    " However, the director, the chemist, model maker, everybody concerned himself much more with the art department, that means with my work.": 1,
    " Then making toilets.": 1,
    "So finally they got a letter from the center.": 1,
    " from the bank who owned the factory, said, make toilets sitting behind the art department.": 1,
    "And that was my end.": 1,
    " So this gave me the possibility because now I was a journeyman and journeymen also take": 1,
    " to see the world, so as a journeyman I put an ad into the paper that I had studied, that I was down to earth's bottom.": 1,
    " I was looking for a job as a journeyman.": 1,
    "I got several answers and I accepted the one which was farthest from home.": 1,
    " half way to America and that was in Hamburg.": 1,
    " Then I first took this job in Hamburg at a": 1,
    " art pottery, everything was done on the wheel, and so I worked in a shop.": 1,
    " where there were several potters, and the first day I was coming to take my place at": 1,
    " There were three or four turntables.": 1,
    "And one of them was a hunchback.": 1,
    " That mutant who smelled very bad, so I doused him in cologne every day because he thought it was very nice.": 1,
    " He brought bread and butter every day which I had to eat out of courtesy.": 1,
    "The first day I came to work in the shop.": 1,
    " There was, on my wheel, a surprise for me.": 1,
    "My colleagues had thoughtfully put on the...": 1,
    " On the wheel, where I was supposed to work, very nicely modeled natural men's organs.": 1,
    " After I brushed them off with a hand motion, I finally was now accepted and worked there for some six months.": 1,
    " This was my first job.": 1,
    " If I go on like this, you will be here till midnight.": 1,
    " So I will try to speed it up a little.": 1,
    " Eva, we have about five minutes.": 1,
    " Are you sure?": 1,
    "If you are sure, I have to tell you that within five minutes I will talk very fast.": 1,
    " Actually,": 1,
    " My work took me through many countries because I used my work to fill my curiosity.": 1,
    " Among other things, other countries have worked, both in the Soviet Union, they have worked": 1,
    " from 32 to 37, actually to 36.": 1,
    "I was finally there, although I had nothing to do, I was a foreign expert.": 1,
    " I became art director of the china and glass industry and eventually was under Stalin's": 1,
    " At the beginning of Stalin's purges, I didn't know that hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested.": 1,
    "So I was arrested quite early in Stalin's purges.": 1,
    " and spent 16 months in": 1,
    " prison.": 1,
    "The accusation was that I had successfully prepared an attack on Stalin's life.": 1,
    "This was a very dangerous": 1,
    " And if this is the end of my five minutes, I want to tell you that I actually did survive, which was a surprise.": 1,
    " But since I survived and I'm here, and since this is the end of the five minutes, I will... Tell me when your last trip to Russia was.": 1,
    "Weren't you there recently?": 1,
    " In fact, the heroin factory was bought by an American company.": 1,
    " invited me, they found out that I had worked in 1933 at this factory, and they came to": 1,
    " studio in Rockland County and brought the 15 of their artists to visit me here and they": 1,
    " myself to come to the Russian factory last summer in July to make some dishes": 1,
    " I designed some dishes, and since I don't like to travel alone, they also invited my": 1,
    " daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter.": 1,
    "So we had a lovely trip to see Gaza today, which is not a very pleasant and happy view.": 1,
    " Here I am now, if this is the end.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
