    "If you spin something, it tends to fly out.": 2,
    " My name is Arvind Gupta and I'm a toy maker.": 1,
    "I've been making toys for the last 30 years.": 1,
    "The early 70s, I was in college.": 1,
    "It was a very revolutionary time.": 1,
    "There was a political firm, so to say, students out in the streets of Paris.": 1,
    " revolting against authority.": 1,
    "America was jolted by the anti-Vietnam movement, the civil rights movement.": 1,
    "In India we had the": 1,
    " When there is a political churning of society, it unleashes a lot of energy.": 1,
    " The national movement in India was testimony to that.": 1,
    "Lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs and jumped into the national movement.": 1,
    " Now in the early 70s, one of the great programs in India was to revitalize primary science in village schools.": 1,
    "There was a person, Anil Sadgopal, did a PhD from Caltech.": 1,
    " and returned back as a molecular biologist in India's cutting research institute, the TIFR.": 1,
    "At 31, he was not able to relate the kind of esoteric research which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people, so he resigned and went and started a village science program.": 1,
    " Many people were inspired by this.": 1,
    "The slogan of the early 70s was, go to the people, live with them, love them, start from what they know, build on what they have.": 1,
    "This was the kind of defining slogan.": 1,
    " Well, I took one year.": 1,
    "I joined Telco to make Tata trucks very close to Pune.": 1,
    "I worked there for two years and I realized that I was not born to make trucks.": 1,
    " Often one doesn't know what one wants to do, but it's good enough to know what you don't want to do.": 1,
    "So I took one year off, and I went to this village science program, and it was a turning point.": 1,
    "It was a very small village.": 1,
    " a weekly bazaar where people just once in a week they put in all their wares.": 1,
    "So I said I'm going to spend a year over here.": 1,
    "So I just bought one specimen of everything which was sold on the roadside.": 1,
    " And one thing which I found was this black rubber.": 1,
    "This is called a cycle valve tube, where you pump in a bicycle and use a bit of this.": 1,
    " And there are some of these models.": 1,
    "So if you take a bit of the cycle value, you can put two matchsticks inside this and you make a flexible joint.": 1,
    "It's a joint of two.": 1,
    "You start by teaching angles, a cute angle, a right angle, a loose angle, a straight angle.": 1,
    "It's like a universal coupling.": 1,
    " If you had three of them and you loop them together, well you make a triangle.": 1,
    "With four you make a square, you make a pentagon, you make a hexagon, you make all these kinds of polygons.": 1,
    " And there are some wonderful properties.": 1,
    "If you look at the head skin for instance, it's like an amoeba which is constantly changing its outer profile.": 1,
    "You can just pull this out and this becomes a rectangle.": 1,
    "You can push this and it becomes a parallelogram.": 1,
    " This is very shaky.": 1,
    "Look at the Pentagon, for instance.": 1,
    "Pull this out, this becomes a boat-shaped trapezium.": 1,
    "Push it and it becomes a house-shaped.": 1,
    "This becomes an isosceles triangle.": 1,
    "Again, very shaky.": 1,
    " this square might look very square and prim give it a little push this becomes a rhombus it becomes a kite shaped but give a child a triangle well she can't do a thing to it why use triangles?": 1,
    "because triangles are the only rigid structures": 1,
    " We can't make a bridge with squares because the train would come, it would start doing a jig.": 1,
    "Ordinary people know about this because": 1,
    " If you go to village India, they might not have gone to engineering college, but no one makes a roof press like this because they put tiles on top, it's just going to crash.": 1,
    "They always make a triangular roof.": 1,
    "Now this is people's science.": 1,
    "If you were to just poke": 1,
    " a hole over here and put a third matchstick you get a T joint and if i were to put all the three legs of this in the three vertices of this triangle i would make a tetrahedron.": 1,
    "so you make all these 3D shapes you make a little tetrahedron like this.": 1,
    " And once you make these, well,": 1,
    " You make a little house, you make...": 1,
    " Put this on top, you can make a joint of four, you can make a joint of six, you just need a thorn.": 1,
    "Now this was, make a joint of six, you make a icosahedron.": 1,
    "It's like, you can play around with it.": 1,
    "This makes like a igloo.": 1,
    "Now this is,": 1,
    " This is in 1978, I was a 24 year old young engineer and I thought this is so much better than making trucks.": 1,
    " And this is...": 1,
    " If you, as a matter of fact, put four marbles inside, you simulate the molecular structure of methane, CH4, four atoms of the hydrogen, the four apes of the tetrahedron, it means a little carbonate.": 1,
    " And well, since then, I just thought that I've been really privileged to go down to over 2,000 schools in my country.": 1,
    "Village schools, government schools, municipal schools, Ivy League schools, I've been invited by most of them.": 1,
    " Every time I go to a school, I see a gleam in the eyes of the children.": 1,
    "I see hope.": 1,
    "I see happiness in their faces.": 1,
    "Children want to make things.": 1,
    "Children want to do things.": 1,
    "We make lots and lots of pumps.": 1,
    "This is a little pump with which you could inflate": 1,
    " balloon.": 1,
    "it's a real pump.": 1,
    "you could actually pop the balloon.": 1,
    "we have a slogan that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it.": 1,
    "so all you do is to just": 1,
    " It's a very kind of provocative statement.": 1,
    "It's a old bicycle tube, and it's based on a chance discovery.": 1,
    "If you take these film cans, they go very snugly into the old bicycle tube, and this is how you make a valve.": 1,
    "You put a little sticky tape.": 1,
    " This is one way traffic.": 1,
    " well you make lots and lots of pumps and this is the other one that you just take a straw and you just put a stick inside this and you make two half cuts now this what you do is you bend both these legs into a triangle and you": 1,
    " Just wrap some tape around, and this is the pump.": 1,
    "And now if you have this pump,": 1,
    " It's like a great, great sprinkler.": 1,
    "It's like a centrifuge.": 1,
    " Well, in terms of, if you were in Andhra Pradesh, you would make this with the palm iron leaf.": 1,
    "Many of our folk toys have great science principles.": 1,
    "If I do it with both hands, you can see this one, Mr. Flying Man.": 1,
    " This is a toy which is made from paper.": 1,
    "It's amazing.": 1,
    "There are four pictures.": 1,
    "You see insects, you see frogs, snakes, eagles, butterflies, frogs, snakes, eagles.": 1,
    "Here's a paper which you could turn.": 1,
    "It's designed by": 1,
    " a mathematician at Harvard in 1928, Arthur Stone, documented by Martin Gardner in many of his many books.": 1,
    "This is great fun for children.": 1,
    " The old study about the food chain that insects eat by the frogs, frogs eat by the snakes, snakes eat by the eagles.": 1,
    "And this can be if you had an old photocopy paper, air force size paper.": 1,
    " You could be in a municipal school, you could be in a government school, a paper, a scale, and a pencil.": 1,
    "No glue, no scissors.": 1,
    "In three minutes, you just fold this up.": 1,
    " And what you could use it is just limited by your imagination.": 1,
    "If you take a smaller paper, you make a smaller flexagon.": 1,
    "With a bigger one, you make a bigger one.": 1,
    " Now this is a pencil with a few slots over here and you put a little fan here.": 1,
    "This is a hundred year old toy.": 1,
    "There have been six major research papers on this.": 1,
    "There are some grooves over here you can see and I take a refill if I rub this.": 1,
    " Something very amazing happens.": 1,
    "Six major research papers on this.": 1,
    "As a matter of fact, Feynman as a child was very fascinated by this.": 1,
    "He wrote a paper on this.": 1,
    "And you don't need the three billion dollar Hadron Collider for doing this.": 1,
    " This is there with every child.": 1,
    "And every child can enjoy this.": 1,
    "If you were to put a color disc, well...": 1,
    " all these seven colors coalesce.": 1,
    "And this is what Newton talked about 200 years back that white light made seven colors just by spinning this around.": 1,
    "This is a straw.": 1,
    " What we've done, we've just sealed both the ends with tape, nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner.": 1,
    "So there are holes in the opposite corners.": 1,
    "There's a little hole over here.": 1,
    "Now this is a kind of a blowing straw.": 1,
    "I just put this inside this.": 1,
    "There's a hole here and I shut this.": 1,
    " This costs very little money to make, great fun for children to do.": 1,
    " what we do is a very simple electric motor.": 1,
    "now this is the simplest motor on earth.": 1,
    " The most expensive thing is the battery inside this.": 1,
    "If you have a battery, it costs five cents to make it.": 1,
    "This is the old bicycle tube which gives you a broad rubber band.": 1,
    " two safety pins.": 1,
    "this is a permanent magnet.": 1,
    "whenever current flows through a coil this becomes an electromagnet.": 1,
    "it is the interaction of both these magnets which makes this motor spin.": 1,
    " made 30,000 teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years.": 1,
    "They just mug up the definition and spit it out.": 1,
    "When teachers make it, children make it, you can see a gleam in their eye.": 1,
    " They feel, they get a thrill of what science is all about.": 1,
    "And the science is not a rich man's game.": 1,
    " In a democratic country, size must reach to our most oppressed, to the most marginalized children.": 1,
    "Now this program started with 16 schools and spread to 1,500 government schools.": 1,
    " over 100,000 children learn science this way and we are just trying to see possibilities with look this is the tetra pack all full material from the point of view of the environment": 1,
    " There are six layers, three layers of plastic, aluminium, which are sealed together.": 1,
    "They are fused together.": 1,
    "You can't separate them.": 1,
    "Now you can just make a little network like this and fold them and stick them together and make an icosahedron.": 1,
    " So something which is trash, which is choking all the severs, you could just recycle this into a very, very joyous, all the platonic solids could be made into a thing like this.": 1,
    " a little straw and what you do is you just cut knit two corners here and this becomes like a": 1,
    " Baby crocodile's mouth.": 1,
    "Put this in your mouth and you blow.": 1,
    "It's the children's delight, the teacher's envy, as I say.": 1,
    " You're not able to see how the sound is produced because the thing which is vibrating was inside my mouth.": 1,
    "I'm going to keep this outside for blowing out.": 1,
    "I'm going to suck in air.": 1,
    " So no one needs to actually mug up that for production of sound we require vibrations.": 1,
    "The other is that you keep blowing at it, keep making the sound and you keep cutting it and something very very nice happens.": 1,
    " And when you get a very small one, this is what the kids teach you.": 1,
    "You can also do this.": 1,
    " Well, before I go any further, this is something worth sharing.": 1,
    "This is a touching slate meant for blind children.": 1,
    "This is strips of Velcro.": 1,
    "This is my drawing slate.": 1,
    "And this is my drawing pen.": 1,
    " which is basically a film box.": 1,
    "It's basically like a fisherman's line, a fishing line.": 1,
    "And this is wool over here.": 1,
    "If I crank the handle all the wool goes inside.": 1,
    " What a blind child can do is to just draw this.": 1,
    "Wool Strix on Velcro.": 1,
    " There are 12 million blind children in our country.": 1,
    " who live in a world of darkness.": 1,
    "And this has come as a great boon to them.": 1,
    " There's a factory out there making our children blind.": 1,
    "We're not able to provide them with food, not able to provide them with vitamin A, but this has come as a great point for them.": 1,
    "There are no patents, anyone can make it.": 1,
    " Well this is very very simple.": 1,
    "You can see this is a generator.": 1,
    "It's a crank generator.": 1,
    "These are two magnets.": 1,
    "This is a large pulley.": 1,
    " made by sandwiching rubber between two old cd's.": 1,
    "small pulleys with two strong magnets and this 5 turns of wire attached to led.": 1,
    "if i spin this pulley the small one is going to spin much faster.": 1,
    "there would be a spinning magnetic field.": 1,
    "lines of force would be cut.": 1,
    "there would be emf generated.": 1,
    "and you can see this led is going": 1,
    " to glow.": 1,
    "so this is small crank generator.": 1,
    " Well, this is again.": 1,
    " It's just a ring, a steel ring, with steel nuts.": 1,
    "And what you can do is just, if you give it a twirl, well, they just keep going on.": 1,
    " And imagine a bunch of kids standing in a circle and just waiting for the staring to be passed on.": 1,
    "And they'd be absolutely joyous playing with this.": 1,
    " But in the end, what we can also do, we use a lot of old newspapers to make caps.": 1,
    "This is worthy of a Sachin Tendulkar.": 1,
    "It's a great cricket cap.": 1,
    " Well, firstly, you see Nehru and Gandhi.": 1,
    "This is the Nehru cap.": 1,
    "Just half a newspaper.": 1,
    "Well, we make lots of toys with newspapers.": 1,
    "This is one of them.": 1,
    "And this is, you can see this is a...": 1,
    " It's a flapping bird.": 1,
    "One of our old newspapers, we cut them into little squares.": 1,
    "And if you have one of these birds, children in Japan have been making this bird for many, many years.": 1,
    "And this is, you can see this a little.": 1,
    " A fantail bird.": 1,
    " Well, in the end, I'll just end with a story.": 1,
    "This is called the captain's hat story.": 1,
    "Captain was a captain of a seagoing ship.": 1,
    "Goes very slowly.": 1,
    "There were lots of passengers in the ship.": 1,
    "They were getting bored, so the captain invited them on the deck.": 1,
    " You know, wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance, I'll provide you with good food and drinks.": 1,
    "And the captain would wear a cap every day and join in the regalia.": 1,
    "The first day it would be a huge umbrella cap, like a captain's cap.": 1,
    " That night when the passenger would be sleeping, he would give it one more fold and the second day he would be wearing a fireman's cap with a little chute.": 1,
    "It's like a designer cap because it protects the spinal cord.": 1,
    " and the second night he would take the same cap and give it on the fault and the third day it would be a shikari cap.": 1,
    " adventurous cap.": 1,
    "And the third night, he would give it two more folds, and this is a very, very famous cap.": 1,
    "If you've seen any of our Bollywood films, this is what the policeman wears.": 1,
    "It's called a pandu cap.": 1,
    " is being catapulted to glory, to international glory.": 1,
    "And we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship.": 1,
    "So that's a ship.": 1,
    " Everyone was enjoying the journey very much.": 1,
    "They were singing and dancing.": 1,
    "Suddenly there's a storm and huge waves and all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves.": 1,
    "A huge wave comes and slaps the front and knocks it down.": 1,
    " And then another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down.": 1,
    "And there's a third one over here.": 1,
    "This is called as a bridge and knocks it down and the ship sinks and the captain has lost everything but for a life jacket.": 1,
    " Thank you so much.": 1
