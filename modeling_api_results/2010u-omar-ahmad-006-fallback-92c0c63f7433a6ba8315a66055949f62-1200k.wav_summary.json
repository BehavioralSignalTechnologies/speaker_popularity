    " One of the things that define a Tedster is you've taken your passion and you've turned it into stewardship.": 1,
    "You actually put action to the issues you care about.": 1,
    " But what you're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out.": 1,
    "So how do you do that?": 1,
    " One of the things I should probably tell you is I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career and that sort of warped my framework.": 1,
    "So when you start to think about politicians,": 1,
    " You gotta realize these are strange creatures.": 1,
    "Other than the fact that they can't tell directions and have very strange breeding habits, how do you actually work with these things?": 1,
    " What we need to understand is what drives the political creature.": 1,
    "And there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart.": 1,
    "One is reputation and influence.": 1,
    "These are the primary tools by which a politician can do his job.": 1,
    " The second one, unlike most animals, which is survival of the species, this is preservation of self.": 1,
    " Now, you may think it's money, but that's actually sort of a proxy to what I can do to preserve myself.": 1,
    "Now, the challenge with you moving your issue forward is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time.": 1,
    " So what doesn't work in terms of getting your issue to be important?": 1,
    "You can send them an email.": 1,
    "Well, unfortunately, I've got so many Viagra ads coming at me.": 1,
    "Your email is lost.": 1,
    "It doesn't matter.": 1,
    "It's spam.": 1,
    " How about you get it on the phone?": 1,
    "Well, chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone.": 1,
    "Yes, they called and they said they didn't like it.": 1,
    "That doesn't move.": 1,
    "Face-to-face would work, but it's hard to set it up.": 1,
    "It's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work.": 1,
    " Yes, contributions actually do make a difference, and they set a context for having a conversation, but it takes some time to build up.": 1,
    "So what actually works?": 1,
    "And the answer is rather strange.": 1,
    "It's a letter.": 1,
    " We live in a digital world, but we're fairly analog creatures.": 1,
    "Letters actually work.": 1,
    "Even the top dog himself takes time every day to read 10 letters that are picked out by staff.": 1,
    " I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean.": 1,
    "So how are you going to write your letter?": 1,
    "First of all, you're going to pick up an analog device, a pen.": 1,
    " I know these are tough and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it.": 1,
    " But this is actually critical, and it is critical that you actually handwrite your letter.": 1,
    "It is so novel to see this that somebody actually picked up an analogue device and has written to me.": 1,
    "Second of all,": 1,
    " I'm going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month.": 1,
    "Here's my promise to you.": 1,
    "If you are consistent and do this, within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and says, what do you think?": 1,
    " Now I'm going to give you a four paragraph format to work with.": 1,
    "Now, when you approach these animals,": 1,
    " You need to understand there's a dangerous end to them, and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness.": 1,
    "So in paragraph number one, what I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this.": 1,
    "Do you appreciate them?": 1,
    " You may not appreciate the person, you may not appreciate anything else, but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig.": 1,
    "When animals are going to make a point, they make the point.": 1,
    "They don't spend a lot of time dicking around, so here you go.": 1,
    " Paragraph number two, you may actually have to just get very blunt and say, what's really on your mind?": 1,
    " When you do this, don't attack people, you attack tactics.": 1,
    "Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere.": 1,
    "Paragraph number three.": 1,
    " When animals are attacked or cornered, they will fight to the death.": 1,
    "So you have to give them an exit.": 1,
    "Most of the time if they have an exit strategy, they should take it.": 1,
    " Obviously you're intelligent.": 1,
    "If you had the right information, you would have done the right thing.": 1,
    " Lastly, you want to be the nurturing agent.": 1,
    "You're the safe place to come into.": 1,
    "So in paragraph number four, you're going to tell people,": 1,
    " If no one is providing you this information, let me help.": 1,
    " Animals do displays.": 1,
    "They do two things.": 1,
    "They warn you or they try to attract you and say, we need to mate.": 1,
    " You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter.": 1,
    "You do a number of things.": 1,
    "You're a vice president.": 1,
    "You volunteer.": 1,
    "You do something else.": 1,
    "Why is this important?": 1,
    "Because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature that you have influence in a large sphere.": 1,
    " and that my preservation depends on you.": 1,
    "Here is one very quick hack, especially for the feds in the audience.": 1,
    "Here's how you mail your letter.": 1,
    "First of all, you send the original to the district office.": 1,
    " Do you send the copy to the main office?": 1,
    "If they follow protocol, they pick up the phone and say, hey, do you have the original?": 1,
    "Then some droid in the back puts a name on a tickler and says, oh, this is an important letter.": 1,
    "And you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read.": 1,
    " So what's your letter means?": 1,
    "I gotta tell you, we are all in a party, and political officials are the pinatas.": 1,
    " We are harangued, lectured to, sold, marketed, but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication.": 1,
    "I got this letter when I was first elected and I still carry it to every council meeting I go to.": 1,
    " This is an opportunity at real dialogue.": 1,
    "And if you have stewardship and want to communicate, that dialogue is incredibly powerful.": 1,
    "So when you do that, here's what I can promise.": 1,
    "You're going to be the 800-pound gorilla in the forest.": 1,
    " Get writing.": 1
