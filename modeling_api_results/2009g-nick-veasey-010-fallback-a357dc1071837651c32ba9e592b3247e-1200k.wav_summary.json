    " So 120 years ago, Dr. Rontgen x-rayed his wife's hand.": 1,
    "Quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor with her brooch, I'm not sure.": 1,
    " It seems a bit extreme to me, but that image was the start of the X-ray technology and I'm still fundamentally using the same principles today, but I'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner.": 1,
    " The first shot I ever did was of a soda can, which was to promote a brand that we all know, so I'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it.": 1,
    "But the second shot I did was my shoes that I was wearing on the day, and I do really like this shot because": 1,
    " It shows all the detritus that's sort of embedded in the sole of the sneakers.": 1,
    "It was just one of those potluck things where you get it right first time.": 1,
    " Moving on to something a bit larger, this is an x-ray of a bus and the bus is full of people.": 1,
    "It's actually the same person, it's just one skeleton.": 1,
    "Back in the 60s they used to teach student radiographers to take x-rays, thankfully not on you and I.": 1,
    " on dead people, so I still got access to one of these dead people called Frieda, she's falling apart, I'm afraid, because she's very old and fragile, but everyone on that bus is Frieda, and the bus is taken with a cargo scanning X-ray": 1,
    " which is the sort of machine you have on borders which checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things.": 1,
    "Fairly obvious what that is.": 1,
    " So using large-scale objects does sort of create drama because you just don't see X-rays of big things that often.": 1,
    " technology is moving ahead and these large cargo scanner x-rays that work with the digital system are getting better and better and better.": 1,
    "Again though to make it come alive you need somehow to add the human element and I think the reason this image works again is because Frieda is driving the bulldozer.": 1,
    " Quite a difficult brief, make a pair of men's pants look beautiful, but I think the process in itself shows how exquisite they are.": 1,
    " Fashion, now I'm sort of anti-fashion because I don't show the surface, I show what's within.": 1,
    "So the fashionistas don't really like me because it doesn't matter if Kate Moss is wearing it or if I'm wearing it, it looks the same.": 1,
    " We all look the same inside, believe me.": 1,
    "The creases in the material and the sort of nuances.": 1,
    "I show things for really what they are, what they're made of.": 1,
    "I peel back the layers and expose it.": 1,
    "And if it's well made, I show it.": 1,
    "If it's badly made, I show it.": 1,
    " And I'm sure Ross can associate that with design.": 1,
    "The design comes from within.": 1,
    "It's not just Topshop.": 1,
    "I get some strange looks when I'm going out getting my props.": 1,
    "Here I was fumbling around in the ladies underwear department of a department store.": 1,
    "Almost got escorted from the premises.": 1,
    " I live opposite a farm and this was the runt of the litter, a piglet that died and what's really interesting is that if you look at the legs you notice that the bones haven't fused and should that": 1,
    " that pig have grown, unfortunately it was dead.": 1,
    "It would have certainly been dead after I x-rayed it with the amount of radiation I used anyway.": 1,
    "But once the bones are fused together, it would have been healthy.": 1,
    " So that's an empty puffer jacket, but I quite like the way it's posed.": 1,
    "Nature is my greatest inspiration, and to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with,": 1,
    " is how nature is related to architecture.": 1,
    "If you look at the roof of the Eden Project or the British Library, it's all this honeycomb structure.": 1,
    " And I'm sure those architects are inspired, as I am, by what surrounds us by nature.": 1,
    "This, in fact, is a Victoria water lily leaf that floats on the top of the pond, an amaryllis flower looking really three dimensional.": 1,
    " seaweed have been in the tide.": 1,
    " Now, how do I do this and where do I do this and all that sort of thing?": 1,
    "This is my new purpose-built x-ray shed and the door to my x-ray room is made of lead and steel.": 1,
    "It weighs 1,250 kilograms and it's the only exercise I get is opening and closing it.": 1,
    " The walls are 700mm thick of solid, dense concrete, so I'm using quite a lot of radiation, a lot more than you'd get in a hospital or a vet's.": 1,
    " There I am.": 1,
    "This is a high-powered X-ray machine.": 1,
    "What's interesting about X-ray is that technology is used for looking for cancer or drugs or contraband.": 1,
    "I use that sort of technology to create": 1,
    " things that are quite beautiful.": 1,
    "So still working with film, I'm afraid.": 1,
    "Technology in X-ray where it's a life-size process apart from these large cargo scanning machines hasn't moved on enough for the quality of the image.": 1,
    " and the resolution to be good enough for what I want to do with it, which is show my pictures big.": 1,
    "So I have to use a 1980s drum scanner which was designed in the days when everyone shot.": 1,
    " photographs on film, they scan each individual x-ray and this shows how I do my process of same size x-ray.": 1,
    "So this is again my daughter's dress, still has the tag in it from me buying it so I can take it back to the shop if you didn't like it.": 1,
    " But there are four X-ray plates.": 1,
    "You can see them overlapping.": 1,
    " So when you move forward from something fairly small address, which is this size, onto something like that, which is done in exactly the same process, you can see that that's a lot of work.": 1,
    "In fact, that is three months solid X-raying.": 1,
    "There's over 500 separate components.": 1,
    " Boeing sent me a 747 in containers and I sent them back an X-ray.": 1,
    " I kid you not.": 1,
    "So Frida is my dead skeleton.": 1,
    "This, unfortunately, is basically two pictures.": 1,
    "The one on the extreme right is a photograph of an American footballer.": 1,
    "The one on the left is an x-ray.": 1,
    " But this time I had to use a real body because I needed it with a skin tissue to make it look real, to make it look like he was a real athlete.": 1,
    "So here I had to use a recently deceased body and getting hold of that was...": 1,
    " extremely difficult, laborious, but people do donate their bodies to art and science and when they do I'm in the queue so I like to use them.": 1,
    " The colouring.": 1,
    "So colouring adds another level to the x-rays.": 1,
    "It makes it more organic, more natural.": 1,
    " It's whatever takes my fancy really.": 1,
    "It's not accurately coloured to how it is in real life.": 1,
    "That flower doesn't come in bright orange, I don't think, but I just like it in bright orange.": 1,
    " And also with something technical like these are DJ decks, it sort of adds another level, it makes a two-dimensional image look more three-dimensional.": 1,
    " The most difficult things to x-ray, the most technically challenging things to x-ray are the lightest things, the most delicate things.": 1,
    "So to get the detail in a feather, believe me, if there's anyone out here who knows anything about x-rays, that's quite a challenge.": 1,
    "I'm now going to show you a short film.": 1,
    "I'll step to the side.": 1,
    " The thing in there is very dangerous.": 1,
    "If you touch that you could possibly die of your radiation poisoning.": 1,
    "In my career I've had two exposures to radiation which is two too many because it stays with you for life, it's cumulative.": 1,
    " It has human connotations, the fact it's a child's toy that we all recognise, but also it looks like it's a robot and it comes from a sci-fi genus.": 1,
    " It's a surprise that it has humanity, but also man-made future alien associations.": 1,
    " Just a bit spooky.": 1,
    " I'm not going to stand like this anymore.": 1,
    " The bus was done with a cargo scanning x-ray machine which is used on the borders between countries looking for contraband and illegal immigrants.": 1,
    "The lorry goes in front of it and it takes slices.": 1,
    " x-rays through the lorries and that's how this was done actually slice slice it's a bit like a CT scanner in a hospital slice and then if you look carefully there's all little things": 1,
    " he's got headphones on reading the newspaper got a hat on glasses got a bag so these little details": 1,
    " help to make it work, make it real.": 1,
    " The problem with using living people is that to take an x-ray for x-ray you, you get exposed to radiation.": 1,
    "So to avoid that...": 1,
    " and I have to avoid it somehow, is I use dead people.": 1,
    "Now that's a variety of things from recently deceased bodies to a skeleton that was used by student radiographers to train": 1,
    " in taking x-rays of the human body at different densities.": 1,
    " I have very high-tech equipment of gloves, scissors and a bucket.": 1,
    " I will show how the capillary action works, how it feeds.": 1,
    "I'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves.": 1,
    "Look at this monster!": 1,
    " It's so basic, it just grows wild.": 1,
    "That's what I really like about it.": 1,
    "The fact that I'm going to go and buy it and it hasn't been genetically modified at all is just happening.": 1,
    " and the x-ray shows how beautiful nature can be.": 1,
    "Not that that is particularly beautiful when you look at it with a human eye.": 1,
    " the way the leaves form they're curling back on each other so the x-rays will show the overlaps in these little corners": 1,
    " AHHHHHHHH": 1,
    " The thicker the object, the more radiation it needs and the more time it needs.": 1,
    "The lighter the object, the less radiation.": 1,
    "Sometimes you keep the time up because the time gives you detail a lot.": 1,
    "The longer the exposure goes on for, the more detail you get.": 1,
    " If you look at this particular tube, it is quite bright, but I could get a bit darker in the tube, but everything else would suffer, so these leaves at the edge would start to disappear.": 1,
    "What I like is how hard the edges are, how sharp.": 1,
    " Yeah, I'm quite pleased with that.": 1,
    " I travel beyond the surface and show something for what it's worth, what it's really made of, how it really works, but also I find that": 1,
    " I've got the benefit of taking away all the surface, which is things that people are used to seeing.": 1,
    " sort of thing I've been doing.": 1,
    "I've got the opportunity now to show you what I'm going to be doing in the future.": 1,
    "This is a commercial application of my most recent work.": 1,
    "And what's good about this, I think, is that it's sort of like a moment in time, like you've turned around, you've got x-ray vision, and you've": 1,
    " taken a picture with the X-ray camera.": 1,
    "Unfortunately, I haven't got X-ray vision.": 1,
    "I do dream in X-ray.": 1,
    "I see my projects in my sleep and I know what they're going to look like in X-ray and I'm not far off.": 1,
    " So what am I doing in the future?": 1,
    "Well, this year is the 50th anniversary of Sosagoni's Mini, which is one of my favourite cars.": 1,
    "So I've taken it apart component by component, months and months and months of work.": 1,
    "And with this image,": 1,
    " I'm going to be displaying it in the Victoria and Albert Museum as a light box which is actually attached to the car.": 1,
    "So I'm going to saw the car in half down the middle.": 1,
    "Not an easy task in itself.": 1,
    " And then so you can get in the driver's side, sit down, and up against you is a wall.": 1,
    "And if you get out and walk around the other side of the car, you see a life-size light box of the car showing you how it works.": 1,
    " I'm going to take that idea and apply it to other iconic things from my life.": 1,
    "My first computer was a big movement in my life.": 1,
    "I had a Mac Classic and it's a little box and I think that'll look quite neat as an x-ray.": 1,
    " I'm also looking to take my work from the two-dimensional form to a more three-dimensional form and this is quite a good way of doing it.": 1,
    " I'm also working now with x-ray video, so if you can imagine some of these flowers and they're actually moving and growing and you can film that in x-ray, it should be quite stunning.": 1,
    "So that's it, I'm done.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
