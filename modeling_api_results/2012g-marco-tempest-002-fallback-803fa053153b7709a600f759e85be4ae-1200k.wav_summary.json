    " Good morning.": 1,
    "So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow.": 1,
    "As a cyber magician, I combine elements of illusion and science.": 1,
    " to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced.": 1,
    "You've probably all heard of Google's Project Glass.": 1,
    "It's new technology.": 1,
    "You look through them, and the world you see is augmented with data.": 1,
    " names of places, monuments, buildings, maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street.": 1,
    "So these are my illusion glasses.": 1,
    " a little bigger.": 1,
    "They're a prototype.": 1,
    "And when you look through them, you get a glimpse into the minds of the cyber illusionists.": 1,
    "Let me show you what I mean.": 1,
    "All we need": 1,
    " is a playing card.": 1,
    "Any card will do, just like this.": 1,
    "And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again.": 1,
    " Alright, very significant mark.": 1,
    " Let's put it back into the deck somewhere in the middle and let's get started.": 1,
    " For those of you who don't play cards, a deck of cards is made up of four different suits.": 1,
    "Hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades.": 1,
    " The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols and have been interpreted in many different ways.": 1,
    " Now, some say that the four suits represent the four seasons.": 1,
    " Summer.": 1,
    "Autumn.": 1,
    "My favorite season is winter.": 1,
    "Yeah, mine too.": 1,
    "Winter is like magic.": 1,
    "It's a time of change when warmth turns to cold.": 1,
    " Water turns to snow and then it always appears.": 1,
    " There are 13 cards in each suit.": 1,
    "Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles.": 1,
    "So over here is low tide.": 1,
    " And over here is Hightight, and in the middle is the moon.": 1,
    " The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic.": 1,
    "There are two colors in a deck of cards.": 1,
    "There is the color red.": 1,
    " And...": 1,
    " the color black, representing the constant change from day": 1,
    " And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards?": 1,
    " Just a star of 52 weeks in a year.": 1,
    "If you total all the spots on a deck of cards, the result is 365.": 1,
    " Oh, 365.": 1,
    "The number of days in a year.": 1,
    "The number of days between each birthday.": 1,
    " Make a wish.": 1,
    "Don't tell or it won't come true.": 1,
    "As a matter of fact, it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards.": 1,
    " And ever since that day, I have traveled around the world, performing magic for boys and girls, men and women, husbands and wives, even kings and queens.": 1,
    " And who are these?": 1,
    "Ah, mischief makers.": 1,
    "Watch.": 1,
    " Wake up!": 1,
    "Are you ready for your party piece?": 1,
    "Ready!": 1,
    "Let me see what you got!": 1,
    "Presenting...": 1,
    " Ah, watch out.": 1,
    " But today I am performing for a different kind of audience.": 1,
    "I'm performing for you.": 1,
    "Sign card detected.": 1,
    " Well, sometimes people ask me, how do you become a magician?": 1,
    "Is it a 9 to 5 job?": 1,
    "Of course not, you got to practice 24-7.": 1,
    "I don't literally mean 24 hours, 7 days a week.": 1,
    " 24-7 is a little bit of an exaggeration, but it does take practice.": 1,
    "Now some people will say, well magic, that must be the work of some": 1,
    " evil supernatural force.": 1,
    " Well, to this, I just say no, no.": 1,
    "Actually in German it's nine, nine.": 1,
    "Magic isn't that intense.": 1,
    "I have to warn you though, if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this...": 1,
    " Don't play for money.": 1,
    " Why not?": 1,
    "That's a very good hand.": 1,
    "The odds of getting it are 4165 to 1.": 1,
    "Yeah, but I guess my hand is better.": 1,
    "We beat the odds!": 1,
    " I think you got your birthday wish.": 1,
    "And that actually leaves me with the last and most important card of all.": 1,
    "The one with this very significant mark on it.": 1,
    "And unlike anything else we've just seen": 1,
    " Virtual or not.": 1,
    " This is without a question the real thing.": 1,
