    " Four years ago, a security researcher, or as most people would call it, a hacker, found a way to literally make ATMs throw money at him.": 1,
    " His name was Barnaby Jack.": 1,
    " And this technique was later called jackpotting in his honor.": 1,
    "I'm here today because I think we actually need hackers.": 1,
    " Barnaby Jack could have easily turned into a career criminal or James Bond villain with his knowledge, but he chose to show the world his research instead.": 1,
    " He believed that sometimes you have to demo a threat to spark a solution.": 1,
    " And I feel the same way.": 1,
    "That's why I'm here today.": 1,
    "We are often terrified and fascinated by the power hackers now have.": 1,
    "They scare us.": 1,
    " But the choices they make have dramatic outcomes that influence us all.": 1,
    " So I am here today because I think we need hackers.": 1,
    "And in fact, they just might be the immune system for the information age.": 1,
    " Sometimes they make us sick, but they also find those hidden threats in our world, and they make us fix it.": 1,
    "I knew that I might get hacked for giving this talk.": 1,
    " So let me save you the effort.": 1,
    "In true Ted fashion, here's my most embarrassing picture.": 1,
    " But it would be difficult for you to find me in it because I'm the one who looks like a boy standing to the side.": 1,
    "I was such a nerd back then that even the boys on the Dungeons and Dragons team wouldn't let me join.": 1,
    " This is who I was.": 1,
    "And this is who I wanted to be.": 1,
    " Angelina Jolie.": 1,
    "She portrayed acid burn in the 95 film Hackers.": 1,
    "She was pretty and she could rollerblade.": 1,
    "But being a hacker, that made her powerful.": 1,
    "Now I want it to be just like her.": 1,
    " So I started spending a lot of time on hacker chat rooms and online forums.": 1,
    " I remember one late night I found a bit of PHP code.": 1,
    "I didn't really know what it did, but I copy-pasted it and used it anyway to get into a password-protected site like that.": 1,
    " open sesame.": 1,
    "It was a simple trick, and I was just a script kiddy back then.": 1,
    "But to me, that trick, it felt like this.": 1,
    "Like I had discovered limitless potential in my fingertips.": 1,
    " This is the rush of power that hackers feel.": 1,
    "It's geeks, just like me, discovering they have access to superpower.": 1,
    " one that requires the skill and tenacity of their intellects.": 1,
    "But thankfully, no radioactive spiders.": 1,
    "But with great power comes great responsibility.": 1,
    " And you all like to think that if we had such powers, we'd only use them for good.": 1,
    " What if you could read your ex's emails?": 1,
    "Or add a couple zeros to your bank account?": 1,
    "What would you do then?": 1,
    "Indeed, many hackers do not resist those temptations.": 1,
    " And so they are responsible in one way or another to billions of dollars lost each year to fraud, malware, or plain old identity theft, which is a serious issue.": 1,
    "But there are other hackers, hackers who just like to break things.": 1,
    " And it is precisely those hackers that can find the weaker elements in our world.": 1,
    " and make us fix it.": 1,
    "This is what happened last year when another security researcher called Kyle discovered a gaping hole in the design of certain wireless routers like you might have in your home or office.": 1,
    " He learned that anyone could remotely connect to these devices over the internet and download documents from hard drives attached to those routers.": 1,
    " No password needed.": 1,
    "He reported it to the company, of course, but they ignored his report.": 1,
    "Perhaps they thought universal access was a feature, not a bug.": 1,
    " Until two months ago, when a group of hackers used it to get into people's files.": 1,
    "But they didn't steal anything.": 1,
    "They left a note.": 1,
    " Your router and your documents can be accessed by anyone in the world.": 1,
    "Here's what you should do to fix it.": 1,
    "We hope we helped.": 1,
    " By getting into people's files like that, yeah, they broke the law.": 1,
    "But they also forced that company to fix their product.": 1,
    " Making vulnerabilities known to the public is a practice called full disclosure in the hacker community.": 1,
    "And it is controversial, but it does make me think of how hackers have an evolving effect on technologies we use every day.": 1,
    " This is what Khalil did.": 1,
    "Khalil is a Palestinian hacker from the West Bank.": 1,
    "And he found a serious privacy flaw on Facebook.": 1,
    " which he attempted to report through the company's bug bounty program.": 1,
    "These are usually great arrangements for companies to reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities they find in their code.": 1,
    " Unfortunately, due to some miscommunications, his report was not acknowledged.": 1,
    " frustrated with the exchange he took to use his own discovery to post on Mark Zuckerberg's wall.": 1,
    " This got their attention all right.": 1,
    " And they fixed the bug.": 1,
    " But because he hadn't reported it properly, he was denied the bounty usually paid out for such discoveries.": 1,
    "Thankfully for Khalil, a group of hackers were watching out for him.": 1,
    " In fact, they raised more than $13,000 to reward him for this discovery, raising a vital discussion in the technology industry about how we come up with incentives for hackers to do the right thing.": 1,
    " But I think there's a greater story here still.": 1,
    "Even companies founded by hackers, like Facebook was, still have a complicated relationship when it comes to hackers.": 1,
    " And so for more conservative organizations, it is going to take time and adapting in order to embrace hacker culture and the creative chaos that it brings with it.": 1,
    "But I think it's worth the effort.": 1,
    " Because the alternative to blindly fight all hackers is to go against the power you cannot control at the cost of stifling innovation and regulating knowledge.": 1,
    " These are things that will come back and bite you.": 1,
    " It is even more true if we go after hackers that are willing to risk their own freedom for ideals like the freedom of the web.": 1,
    " Especially in times like this, like today even, as governments and corporates fight to control the internet.": 1,
    " I find it astounding that someone from the shadowy corners of cyberspace can become its voice of opposition, its last line of defense even.": 1,
    " Perhaps someone like Anonymous, the leading brand of global hacktivism.": 1,
    " This universal hacker movement needs no introduction today.": 1,
    "But six years ago, they were not much more than an internet subculture dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats and internet trolling campaigns.": 1,
    " Their moment of transformation was in early 2008, when the Church of Scientology attempted to remove certain leaked videos from appearing on certain websites.": 1,
    " This is when Anonymous was forged out of the seemingly random collection of internet dwellers.": 1,
    "It turns out...": 1,
    " The internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it.": 1,
    "And it will react with cyber attacks and elaborate pranks.": 1,
    " and with a series of organized protests all around the world, from my hometown of Tel Aviv to Adelaide, Australia.": 1,
    " This proves that anonymous and this idea can rally the masses from the keyboards to the streets": 1,
    " and it laid the foundations for dozens of future operations against perceived injustices to their online and offline world.": 1,
    " Since then, they've gone after many targets.": 1,
    "They've uncovered corruption, abuse, they've hacked popes and politicians.": 1,
    " And I think their effect is larger than simple denial of service attacks that take down websites or even leak sensitive documents.": 1,
    " I think that like Robin Hood, they are in the business of redistribution.": 1,
    "But what they are after isn't your money.": 1,
    "It's not your documents.": 1,
    "It's your attention.": 1,
    " They grab the spotlight for causes they support.": 1,
    " forcing us to take note, acting as a global magnifying glass for issues that we are not as aware of, but perhaps we should be.": 1,
    " They have been called many names, from criminals to terrorists, and I cannot justify their illegal means.": 1,
    "But the ideas they fight for are ones that matter to us all.": 1,
    " The reality is hackers can do a lot more than break things.": 1,
    "They can bring people together.": 1,
    " And if the internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it, just watch what happens when you try to shut the internet down.": 1,
    " This took place in Egypt in January 2011.": 1,
    " and as President Husni Mubarak attempted a desperate move to quash the rising revolution on the streets of Cairo, he sent his personal troops down to Egypt's internet service providers.": 1,
    " and had them physically kill the switch on the country's connection to the world overnight.": 1,
    "For a government to do a thing like that was unprecedented, and for hackers, it made it personal.": 1,
    " Hackers like the telecomics group were already active on the ground, helping Egyptians bypass censorship using clever workarounds like Morse code and ham radio.": 1,
    "It was high season for low tech, which the government couldn't block.": 1,
    " But when the net went completely down, telecomics brought in the big guns.": 1,
    " They found European service providers that still had 20 year old analog dial-up access infrastructure.": 1,
    "They opened up 300 of those lines for Egyptians to use.": 1,
    " serving slow but sweet internet connection for Egyptians.": 1,
    "This worked.": 1,
    "It worked so well, in fact, one guy even used it to download an episode of How I Met Your Mother.": 1,
    " But while Egypt's future is still uncertain, when the same thing happened in Syria just one year later, telecomics were prepared with those internet lines.": 1,
    " And Anonymous, they were perhaps the first international group to officially denounce the actions of the Syrian military by defacing their website.": 1,
    " But with this sort of power?": 1,
    " It really depends on where you stand, because one man's hero can be another's villain.": 1,
    " And so the Syrian Electronic Army is a pro-Assad group of hackers who support his contentious regime.": 1,
    " They've taken down multiple high-profile targets in the past few years, including the Associated Press' Twitter account.": 1,
    " in which they posted a message about an attack on the White House, injuring President Obama.": 1,
    " This tweet was fake, of course, but the resulting drop in the Dow Jones index that day was most certainly not.": 1,
    " and a lot of people lost a lot of money.": 1,
    " This sort of thing is happening all over the world right now.": 1,
    "In conflicts from the Crimean Peninsula to Latin America, from Europe to the United States.": 1,
    " Hackers are a force for social, political and military influence.": 1,
    " as individuals or in groups, volunteers or military conflicts.": 1,
    "There are hackers everywhere.": 1,
    "They come from all walks of life, ethnicities, ideologies, and genders, I might add.": 1,
    " They are now shaping the world's stage.": 1,
    " Hackers represent an exceptional force for change in the 21st century.": 1,
    "This is because access to information is a critical currency of power, one which governments would like to control.": 1,
    " I think they attempt to do by setting up all-you-can-eat surveillance programs.": 1,
    " The thing they need hackers for, by the way.": 1,
    "And so the establishment has long had a love-hate relationship when it comes to hackers.": 1,
    "Because the same people who demonize hacking also utilize it at large.": 1,
    " Two years ago, I saw General Keith Alexander.": 1,
    "He's the NSA director and US cyber commander.": 1,
    "But instead of his four-star general uniform, he was wearing jeans and a t-shirt.": 1,
    " This was a DEFCON, the world's largest hacker conference.": 1,
    "Perhaps like me, General Alexander didn't see 12,000 criminals that day in Vegas.": 1,
    "I think he saw untapped potential.": 1,
    " In fact, he was there to give a hiring pitch.": 1,
    "In this room right here, he said, is the talent our nation needs.": 1,
    "Well, hackers in the back row replied, then stop arresting us.": 1,
    " Indeed, for years, hackers have been on the wrong side of the fence.": 1,
    "But in light of what we know now, who is more watchful?": 1,
    " of our online world, the rules of the game are not that clear anymore.": 1,
    "But hackers are perhaps the only ones still capable": 1,
    " of challenging overreaching governments and data hoarding corporates on their own playing field.": 1,
    "To me, that represents hope.": 1,
    " For the past three decades, hackers have done a lot of things, but they have also impacted civil liberties, innovation, and internet freedom.": 1,
    "So I think it's time we take a good look at how we choose to portray them.": 1,
    " Because if we keep expecting them to be the bad guys, how can they be the heroes too?": 1,
    " My years in the hacker world have made me realize both the problem and the beauty about hackers.": 1,
    " They just can't see something broken in the world and leave it be.": 1,
    " They are compelled to either exploit it or try and change it.": 1,
    "And so they find the vulnerable aspects in our rapidly changing world.": 1,
    " They make us, they force us to fix things or demand something better.": 1,
    "And I think we need them to do just that.": 1,
    "Because after all, it is not information that wants to be free.": 1,
    " It's us.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " Have the planet!": 1
