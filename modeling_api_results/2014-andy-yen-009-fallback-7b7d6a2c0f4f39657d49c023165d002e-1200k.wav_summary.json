    " 25 years ago, scientists at CERN created the World Wide Web.": 1,
    "Since then, the internet has transformed the way we communicate, the way we do business, and even the way we live.": 1,
    " In many ways, the ideas that gave birth to Google, Facebook, Twitter, and so many others have now really transformed our lives.": 1,
    "And this has brought us many real benefits, such as a more cultured society.": 1,
    " However, there are also some downsides to this.": 1,
    "Today, the average person has an astounding amount of personal information online.": 1,
    "And we add to this online information every single time we post on Facebook, each time we search on Google.": 1,
    " and each time we send an email.": 1,
    " Now, many of us probably think, well, one email, there's nothing in there, right?": 1,
    "But if you consider a year's worth of emails, or maybe even a lifetime of email, collectively, this tells a lot.": 1,
    " It tells who we have been, who we have met, and in many ways, even what we're thinking about.": 1,
    "And the more scary part about this is our data now lasts forever.": 1,
    "So your data can and will outlive you.": 1,
    " What has happened is that we've largely lost control over our data and also our privacy.": 1,
    " So this year, as the web turns 25, it's very important for us to take a moment and think about the implications of this.": 1,
    "We have to really think.": 1,
    "We've lost privacy, yes, but actually what we've also lost is the idea of privacy itself.": 1,
    " If you think about it, most of us here today probably remember what life was like before the internet.": 1,
    "But today, there's a new generation that is being taught from a very young age to share everything online.": 1,
    " And this is a generation that is not going to remember when data was private.": 1,
    "So if you keep going down this road 20 years from now, the word privacy is going to have a completely different meaning of what it means to you and I.": 1,
    " So it's time for us to take a moment and think, is there anything we can do about this?": 1,
    "And I believe there is.": 1,
    " Let's take a look at one of the most widely used forms of communication in the world today, email.": 1,
    " Before the invention of email, we largely communicated using letters.": 1,
    "And the process was quite simple.": 1,
    "You would first start by writing your message on a piece of paper.": 1,
    "Then you place it into a sealed envelope.": 1,
    "And from there, you would go ahead and send it after you put a stamp and address on it.": 1,
    " Unfortunately, today, when we actually send an email, we're not sending a letter.": 1,
    "What you're sending in many ways is actually a postcard.": 1,
    "And it's a postcard in the sense that everybody that sees it": 1,
    " from the time it leaves your computer to when it gets the recipient, can actually read the entire contents.": 1,
    "So the solution to this has been known for some time, and there's many attempts to do it.": 1,
    " The most basic solution is to use encryption.": 1,
    "And the idea is quite simple.": 1,
    "First, you encrypt the connection between your computer and the email server.": 1,
    "Then you also encrypt the data as it sits on the server itself.": 1,
    " But there's a problem with this, and that is the email servers also hold the encryption keys.": 1,
    " So now you have a really big lock with a key placed right next to it.": 1,
    "But not only that, any government could lawfully ask for and get the key to your data.": 1,
    "And this is all without you being aware of it.": 1,
    " So the way we fix this problem is actually relatively easy in principle.": 1,
    "You give everybody their own keys, and then you make sure the server doesn't actually have the keys.": 1,
    " This seems like common sense, right?": 1,
    "So the question that comes up is, why hasn't this been done yet?": 1,
    " Well, if you really think about it, we see that the business model of the internet today really isn't compatible with privacy.": 1,
    "Just take a look at some of the biggest names on the web.": 1,
    " And you see that advertising plays a huge role.": 1,
    "In fact, this year alone, advertising is $137 billion.": 1,
    "And to optimize the ads that are shown to us, companies have to know everything about us.": 1,
    " They need to know where we live, how old we are, what we like, what we don't like, and anything else they can get their hands on.": 1,
    "And if you think about it, the best way to get this information is really just invade our privacy.": 1,
    " So these companies aren't going to give us our privacy.": 1,
    "If you want to have privacy online, what we have to do is we've got to go out and get it ourselves.": 1,
    " For many years, when it came to email, the only solution was something known as PGP, which was quite complicated and only accessible to the tech savvy.": 1,
    " Here's a diagram that basically shows the process for encrypting and decrypting messages.": 1,
    "Needless to say, this is not a solution for everybody, and this actually is part of the problem, because if you think about communication,": 1,
    " by definition, involves having someone to communicate with.": 1,
    " So while PGP does a great job of what it's designed to do, for the people out there that can't understand how to use it, the option to communicate privately simply does not exist.": 1,
    "And this is a problem that we need to solve.": 1,
    " So if you want to have privacy online, the only way we can succeed is we get the whole world on board.": 1,
    "And this is only possible if we bring down the barrier to entry.": 1,
    " I think this is actually the key challenge that lies with the tech community.": 1,
    "What we really have to do is work and make privacy more accessible.": 1,
    "So last summer, when the Edward Snowden story came out, several colleagues and I decided to see if we could make this happen.": 1,
    " At that time, we were working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research at the world's largest particle collider, which collides protons, by the way.": 1,
    "We were all scientists, so we used our scientific creativity and came up with a very creative name for our project.": 1,
    " Proton mail.": 1,
    "Many start-ups these days actually began in people's garages or people's basements.": 1,
    "We were a bit different.": 1,
    "We started out at the CERN cafeteria.": 1,
    " which actually is great, because look, you have all the food and water you could ever want.": 1,
    "But even better than this is that every day between 12 p.m.": 1,
    " and 2pm, free of charge.": 1,
    "The CERN cafeteria comes with several thousand scientists and engineers.": 1,
    "And these guys basically know the answers to everything.": 1,
    "So it was in this environment that we began working.": 1,
    " What we actually want to do is we want to take your email and convert it into something that looks more like this.": 1,
    "But more importantly, we want to do it in a way": 1,
    " that you can't even tell that it's happened.": 1,
    "So to do this, we actually need a combination of technology and also design.": 1,
    "So how do we go about doing something like this?": 1,
    " Well, it's probably a good idea not to put the keys on the server.": 1,
    "So what we do is you generate encryption keys on your computer.": 1,
    " And we don't generate a single key, but actually a pair of keys.": 1,
    "So there's an RSA private key and RSA public key.": 1,
    "And these keys are mathematically connected.": 1,
    "So let's have a look and see how this works when multiple people communicate.": 1,
    " So here we have Bob and Alice who want to communicate privately.": 1,
    "So the key challenge is to take Bob's message and to get it to Alice in such a way that the server cannot read that message.": 1,
    " So what we have to do is we have to encrypt it before it even leaves Bob's computer.": 1,
    "And one of the tricks is we encrypt it using the public key from Alice.": 1,
    " Now this encrypted data is sent through the server to Alice.": 1,
    "And because the message was encrypted using Alice's public key, the only key that can now decrypt it is the private key that belongs to Alice.": 1,
    " And it turns out Alice is the only person that actually has this key.": 1,
    "So we've now accomplished the objective, which is to get the message from Bob to Alice without the server being able to read what's going on.": 1,
    " Actually what I've shown here is a highly simplified picture.": 1,
    "The reality is much more complex and it requires a lot of software that looks a bit like this.": 1,
    " And that's actually the key design challenge, is how do we take all this complexity, all the software, and implement it in a way that the user cannot see it?": 1,
    " I think with ProtonMill, we have gotten pretty close to doing this.": 1,
    "So let's see how it works in practice.": 1,
    " Here we've got Bob and Alice again, who also want to communicate securely.": 1,
    "They simply create accounts on ProtonMail, which is quite simple and takes a few moments.": 1,
    " And all the key encryption and generation is happening automatically in the background as Bob is creating his account.": 1,
    "Once his account is created, he just clicks compose, and now he can write his email like he does today.": 1,
    " So he fills in his information, and then after that, all he has to do is click Send.": 1,
    "And just like that, without understanding cryptography and without doing anything different from how he writes email today, Bob has just sent an encrypted message.": 1,
    " What we have here is really just the first step.": 1,
    "But it shows that with improving technology, privacy doesn't have to be difficult.": 1,
    "It doesn't have to be disruptive.": 1,
    " If we change the goal from maximizing ad revenue to protecting data, we can actually make it accessible.": 1,
    "Now, I know a question on everybody's minds is,": 1,
    " OK, protecting privacy, this is a great goal.": 1,
    "But can you actually do this without the tons of money that advertisements gives you?": 1,
    "And I think the answer is actually yes.": 1,
    " Because today we've reached a point where people around the world really understand how important privacy is.": 1,
    "And when you have that, anything is possible.": 1,
    " Earlier this year, ProtonMail actually had so many users that we ran our resources.": 1,
    "And when this happened, our community of users got together and donated half a million dollars.": 1,
    " So this is just an example of what can happen when you bring the community together towards a common goal.": 1,
    "We can also leverage the world.": 1,
    " Right now, we have a quarter million people that have signed up for ProtonMail.": 1,
    "And these people come from everywhere.": 1,
    "And this really shows that privacy is not just an American or a European issue.": 1,
    "It's a global issue that impacts all of us.": 1,
    " It's something that we really have to pay attention to going forward.": 1,
    "So what do we have to do to solve this problem?": 1,
    "Well, first of all, we need to support a different business model for the internet, one that does not rely entirely on advertisements.": 1,
    " for revenue and for growth.": 1,
    "We actually need to build a new internet where now our privacy and our ability to control our data is first and foremost.": 1,
    " But even more importantly, we have to build an internet for privacy.": 1,
    "It is no longer just an option, but it's also the default.": 1,
    " We've done the first step with ProtonMail, but this is really just the first step in a very, very long journey.": 1,
    "The good news I can share with you guys today, the exciting news, is that we're not traveling alone.": 1,
    " The movement to protect people's privacy and freedom online is really gaining momentum.": 1,
    "And today, there are dozens of projects from all around the world who are working together to improve our privacy.": 1,
    "These projects protect things from our chat to voice communications.": 1,
    " Also, our file storage, our online search, our online browsing, and many other things.": 1,
    "And these projects are not backed by billions of dollars in advertising.": 1,
    " But they found support really from the people, from private individuals like you and I, from all over the world.": 1,
    "And this really matters, because ultimately, privacy depends on each and every one of us.": 1,
    " And we have to protect it now because our online data is more than just a collection of ones and zeros.": 1,
    "It's actually a lot more than that.": 1,
    " It's our lives, our personal stories, our friends, our families, and in many ways, also our hopes and our aspirations.": 1,
    " And we need to spend time now to really protect our right to share this with the only people that we want to share this with.": 1,
    "Because without this, we simply can't have a free society.": 1,
    "So now is the time for us to collectively stand up and say, yes.": 1,
    " We do want to live in a world with online privacy.": 1,
    "And yes, we can work together to turn this vision into a reality.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " Thanks so much.": 1
