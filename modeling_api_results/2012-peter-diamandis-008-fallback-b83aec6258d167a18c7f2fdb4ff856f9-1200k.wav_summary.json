    " Threats in the wake of Bin Laden's death have spiked.": 1,
    "Famine in Somalia.": 1,
    "Police pepper spray.": 1,
    "Vicious cartels.": 1,
    "Costic cruise lines.": 1,
    "The science will decay.": 1,
    "65 dead.": 1,
    "Tsunami warning.": 1,
    "Cyber attacks.": 1,
    " Drug War Mass Destruction Tornado Recession Default Doomsday Egypt Syria Crisis Death Disaster Oh my god": 1,
    " So those are just a few of the clips I collected over the last six months.": 1,
    "Could have easily been the last six days or the last six years.": 1,
    "The point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that's what our minds pay attention to.": 1,
    " And there's a very good reason for that.": 1,
    "Every second of every day, our senses bring in way too much data that we can possibly process in our brains.": 1,
    " And because nothing is more important to us than survival, the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala.": 1,
    " Now the amygdala is our early warning detector, our danger detector.": 1,
    "It sorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us.": 1,
    " So given a dozen news stories, we will preferentially look at the negative news.": 1,
    " And that old newspaper saying, if it bleeds, it leads, is very true.": 1,
    " So given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week, 24 hours a day, it's no wonder that we're pessimistic.": 1,
    "It's no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse.": 1,
    " But perhaps that's not the case.": 1,
    "Perhaps instead.": 1,
    " It's the distortions brought to us of what's really going on.": 1,
    " Perhaps the tremendous progress we've made over the last century by a series of forces are in fact accelerating.": 1,
    " to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance.": 1,
    "Now, I'm not saying we don't have our set of problems.": 1,
    " climate crisis, species extinction, water and energy shortage, we surely do.": 1,
    "And as humans, we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance": 1,
    " But ultimately, we knocked them down.": 1,
    " So let's look at what this last century has been to see where we're going.": 1,
    " Over the last hundred years, the average human lifespan has more than doubled.": 1,
    "Average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled.": 1,
    "Childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10.": 1,
    " Add to that the cost of food, electricity, transportation, communications have dropped ten to a thousand fold.": 1,
    " Steve Pinker has showed us that in fact we're living during the most peaceful time ever in human history.": 1,
    " And Charles Kenny, that global literacy has gone from 25% to over 80% in the last 130 years.": 1,
    "We truly are living in an extraordinary time.": 1,
    " And many people forget this.": 1,
    "And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher.": 1,
    "In fact, we redefine what poverty means.": 1,
    " Think of this, in America today, the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators, television, mobile phones, air conditioning, and cars.": 1,
    " the wealthiest robber barons of the last century, the emperors on this planet, could have never dreamed of such luxuries.": 1,
    " Underpinning much of this is technology, and of late, exponentially growing technologies.": 1,
    " My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve, on Moore's law, and experiences price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months.": 1,
    " That's why the cell phone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than the supercomputer of the 70s.": 1,
    "Now look at this curve.": 1,
    "This is Moore's law over the last hundred years.": 1,
    "I want you to notice two things from this curve.": 1,
    "Number one, how smooth it is.": 1,
    " through good time and bad time, war time and peace time, recession, depression and boom time.": 1,
    " This is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers.": 1,
    " It doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges.": 1,
    "And also, even though it's plotted on a log curve on the left, it's curving upwards.": 1,
    "The rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster.": 1,
    " And on this curve, riding on Moore's law are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us.": 1,
    "Cloud computing, what my friends at Autodesk call": 1,
    " infinite computing, sensors and networks, robotics, 3D printing, which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet.": 1,
    " synthetic biology, fuels, vaccines, and foods, digital medicine, nanomaterials, and AI.": 1,
    "I mean, how many of you saw the winning of Jeopardy by IBM's Watson?": 1,
    "I mean, that was epic.": 1,
    " In fact, I scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper I could, and I love this.": 1,
    "Watson vanquishes human opponents.": 1,
    " Jeopardy is not an easy game.": 1,
    "It's about the nuance of human language.": 1,
    "And imagine if you would AIs like this on the cloud available to every person with a cell phone.": 1,
    " Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university called Singularity University.": 1,
    "And we teach our students all of these technologies, in particular, how they can be used to solve humanity's grand challenges.": 1,
    " And every year we ask them to start a company or product or service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade.": 1,
    " Think about that, the fact that literally a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today.": 1,
    "30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous.": 1,
    "Today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that.": 1,
    " when I think about creating abundance.": 1,
    " It's not about creating a life of luxury for this planet.": 1,
    "It's about creating a life of possibility.": 1,
    " It is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant.": 1,
    "You see, scarcity is contextual and technology is a resource-liberating force.": 1,
    "Let me give you an example.": 1,
    " So this is a story of Napoleon III in the mid-1800s.": 1,
    "He's the dude on the left.": 1,
    " He invited over to dinner the King of Siam.": 1,
    " all of Napoleon's troops were fed with silver utensils.": 1,
    " Napoleon himself with gold utensils.": 1,
    "But the king of Sam, he was fed with aluminum utensils.": 1,
    "You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet.": 1,
    " worth more than gold and platinum.": 1,
    "It's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument is made of aluminum.": 1,
    "You see, even though aluminum is 8.3% of the earth by mass,": 1,
    " It doesn't come as a pure metal.": 1,
    "It's all bound by oxygen and silicates.": 1,
    "But then a technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throwaway mentality.": 1,
    " So let's project this analogy going forward.": 1,
    " We think about energy scarcity.": 1,
    " Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is bathed with five thousand times more energy than we use in a year.": 1,
    " 16 terawatts of energy hit the Earth's surface every 88 minutes.": 1,
    " It's not about being scarce, it's about accessibility.": 1,
    "And there's good news here.": 1,
    "For the first time this year, the cost of solar-generated electricity is 50% that of diesel-generated electricity in India.": 1,
    " 8.8 rupees versus 17 rupees.": 1,
    "The cost of solar dropped 50% last year.": 1,
    "Last month, MIT put out a study showing up at the end of this decade.": 1,
    " In the sunny parts of the United States, solar electricity would be 6 cents a kilowatt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average.": 1,
    " And if we have abundant energy, we also have abundant water.": 1,
    " Now, we talk about water wars.": 1,
    " Do you remember when Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft back towards the Earth in 1990 after it just passed Saturn?": 1,
    "He took a famous photo.": 1,
    "What was it called?": 1,
    " A pale blue dot.": 1,
    " Because we live on a water planet.": 1,
    "We live on a planet 70% covered by water.": 1,
    "Yes, 97.5% is salt water, 2% is ice, and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet.": 1,
    "But here, too, there is hope.": 1,
    " And there is technology coming online, not 10, 20 years from now, right now.": 1,
    " There's nanotechnology coming on, nanomaterials.": 1,
    "And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the great DIY innovators I'd like to share with you, he gave me permission to do so.": 1,
    " His technology called Slingshot, that many of you may have heard of, it's the size of a small dorm room refrigerator.": 1,
    "It's able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source, salt water, polluted water, latrine, at less than two cents a liter.": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1,
    " The chairman of Coca-Cola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world.": 1,
    "And if that pans out, which of every confidence it will,": 1,
    " Coca-Cola will deploy this globally to 206 countries around the planet.": 1,
    "This is the kind of innovation empowered by this technology that exists today.": 1,
    " And we've seen this in cell phones.": 1,
    "My goodness, we're going to hit 70% penetration of cell phones in the developing world by the end of 2013.": 1,
    "Think about it.": 1,
    " that a Maasai warrior on a cell phone in the middle of Kenya has better mobile comm than President Reagan did 25 years ago.": 1,
    " And if they're on a smartphone on Google, they've got access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton did 15 years ago.": 1,
    "They're living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted.": 1,
    " Better than that, the things that you and I spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for.": 1,
    "GPS, HD video and still images, libraries of books and music.": 1,
    " medical diagnostic technology are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing into your cell phone.": 1,
    " Probably the best part of it is what's coming down the pike in health.": 1,
    " Last month, I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcomm Foundation something called the $10 million Qualcomm Tri-Quarter XPrize.": 1,
    " We're challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to, because it's got AI.": 1,
    "You can cough on it.": 1,
    "You can do a finger blood prick.": 1,
    "And to win, it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board-certified doctors.": 1,
    " So literally, imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors.": 1,
    "25% of the disease burden and 1.3% of the healthcare workers.": 1,
    " When this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus that it doesn't recognize, it calls the CDC and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place.": 1,
    " But here, here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance.": 1,
    "I call it the rising billion.": 1,
    " So the white lines here are population.": 1,
    "We just passed the seven billion mark on Earth.": 1,
    "And by the way, the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy.": 1,
    " In 2010, we had just short of 2 billion people online connected.": 1,
    " By 2020, that's going from two billion to five billion internet users.": 1,
    "Three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation.": 1,
    " What will these people want?": 1,
    "What will they consume?": 1,
    "What will they desire?": 1,
    "And rather than having economic shutdown, we're about to have the biggest economic injection ever.": 1,
    "These people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy.": 1,
    " and they will get healthier by using a tricorder, and they'll become better educated by using the econ academy, and by literally being able to use 3D printing and infinite computing more productive than ever before.": 1,
    " So what could three billion rising, healthy, educated and productive members of humanity bring to us?": 1,
    " How about a set of voices that have never been heard from before?": 1,
    "What about giving the oppressed wherever they might be the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever?": 1,
    "What will these three billion people bring?": 1,
    " What about contributions we can't even predict?": 1,
    "The one thing I've learned at the X Prize is that small teams": 1,
    " driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things, things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past.": 1,
    "Let me share and close with a story that really got me excited.": 1,
    " There is a program that some of you might have heard of.": 1,
    "It's a game called Fold It.": 1,
    "It came out of the University of Washington in Seattle.": 1,
    " And this is a game where individuals can actually": 1,
    " take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold.": 1,
    "And how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality.": 1,
    "It's very important for research in medicine, and up until now, it's been a supercomputer problem.": 1,
    " And this game has been played by university professors and so forth, and it's literally hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it.": 1,
    "And it showed that, in fact, today, the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers.": 1,
    " And when these individuals went and looked at who is the best protein folder in the world,": 1,
    " It wasn't an MIT professor.": 1,
    "It wasn't a Caltech student.": 1,
    "It was a person from England, from Manchester, a woman.": 1,
    " who during the day": 1,
    " was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic.": 1,
    " And at night, with the world's best protein folder.": 1,
    " Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me tremendous confidence in the future.": 1,
    " is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet.": 1,
    " We have the tools with this exponential technology.": 1,
    "We have the passion of the DIY innovator.": 1,
    "We have the capital of the techno philanthropist.": 1,
    "And we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us.": 1,
    " to solve the grand challenges, to do that which we must do.": 1,
    " We are living into an extraordinary decade ahead.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
