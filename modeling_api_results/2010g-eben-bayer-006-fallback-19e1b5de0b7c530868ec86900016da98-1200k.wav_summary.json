    " So I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years.": 1,
    " But before I do that, I need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics, which require huge amounts of energy to create, and because of their disposal issues, are slowly poisoning our planet.": 1,
    " I also want to tell you and share with you how my team and I have been using mushrooms over the last three years.": 1,
    " Not like that.": 1,
    "We're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials which perform a lot like plastics during their use but are made from crop wastes and are totally compostable at the end of their lives.": 1,
    " But first, I need to talk to you about what I consider one of the most egregious offenders in the disposable plastics category.": 1,
    "This is a material you all know as styrofoam, but I like to think of it as toxic white stuff.": 1,
    " In a single cubic foot of this material, about what would come around your computer or large television, you have the same energy content of about a liter and a half of petrol.": 1,
    "Yet after just a few weeks of use, you'll throw this material in the trash.": 1,
    " And this isn't just found in packaging.": 1,
    "$20 billion of this material is produced every year, and everything from building materials to surfboards to coffee cups to table tops.": 1,
    "And that's not the only place it's found.": 1,
    " The EPA estimates in the United States, by volume, this material occupies 25% of our landfills.": 1,
    " Even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment on the side of the road or next to a river.": 1,
    "If it's not picked up by a human, like me and you, it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years.": 1,
    " Perhaps even worse, is when it finds its way into our oceans.": 1,
    "Like in the great plastic gyre, where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits, but they're not really going away.": 1,
    "They're not biologically compatible.": 1,
    " They're basically following up Earth's respiratory and circulatory systems.": 1,
    "And because these materials are so prolific, because they're found in so many places, there's one other place you'll find this material, styrene, which is made from benzene, a known carcinogen.": 1,
    " You'll find it inside of you.": 1,
    " So for all these reasons, I think we need better materials.": 1,
    "And there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials.": 1,
    " The first is feedstocks.": 1,
    " Today we use a single feedstock petroleum to heat our homes, power our cars, and make most of the materials you see around you.": 1,
    "We recognize this as a finite resource, and it's simply crazy to do this, to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash every time you get a package.": 1,
    " Second of all, we should really strive to use far less energy in creating these materials.": 1,
    "I say far less because 10% isn't going to cut it.": 1,
    "We should be talking about half, quarter, one-tenth the energy content.": 1,
    " And lastly, and I think perhaps most importantly, we should be creating materials that fit into what I call nature's recycling system.": 1,
    " This recycling system has been in place for the last billion years.": 1,
    "I fit into it.": 1,
    "You fit into it.": 1,
    "In 100 years tops, my body can return to the earth with no pre-processing.": 1,
    "Yet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday is going to last for thousands of years, right?": 1,
    "This is crazy.": 1,
    " But nature provides us with a really good model here.": 1,
    " When a tree is done using its leaves, its solar collectors, these amazing molecular photon capturing devices at the end of a season, it doesn't pack them up, take them to the leaf reprocessing center, and have them melted down to form new leaves.": 1,
    "It just drops them the shortest distance possible to the forest floor.": 1,
    " where they're actually upcycled into next year's topsoil.": 1,
    " gets us back to the mushrooms.": 1,
    "Because in nature, mushrooms are the recycling system.": 1,
    "And what we've discovered is that by using a part of the mushroom you've probably never seen, analogous to its root structure, it's called mycelium,": 1,
    " we can actually grow materials with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics.": 1,
    " Now, mausoleum is an amazing material because it's a self-assembling material.": 1,
    "It actually takes things we would consider waste, things like seed husks or woody biomass.": 1,
    " and can transform them into a chitinous polymer, which you can form into almost any shape.": 1,
    "In our process, we basically use it as a glue.": 1,
    "And by using miscellium as a glue, you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry.": 1,
    " And you can create materials with many different properties.": 1,
    "Materials that are insulating, fire resistant, moisture resistant, vapor resistant, materials that can absorb impacts, that can absorb acoustical impacts.": 1,
    " But these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts, not made out of petroleum.": 1,
    "And because they're made of natural materials, they're 100% compostable in your own backyard.": 1,
    " So I'd like to share with you the four basic steps required to make these materials.": 1,
    "The first is selecting a feedstock, preferably something that's regional, that's in your area, right?": 1,
    "Local manufacturing.": 1,
    " The next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool, physically filling in closure, a mold, in whatever shape you want to get.": 1,
    " Then you actually grow the mycelium through these particles, and that's where the magic happens, because the organism is doing the work in this process, not the equipment.": 1,
    " The final step is, of course, the product, whether it's a packaging material, a tabletop, or a building block.": 1,
    "Our vision is local manufacturing, like the local food movement for production.": 1,
    "So we've created formulations for all around the world using regional byproducts.": 1,
    "If you're in China,": 1,
    " You might use a right husk or a cotton seed hull.": 1,
    "If you're in Northern Europe or North America, you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls.": 1,
    " We then process these husks with some basic equipment, and I want to share with you a quick video from our facility that gives you a sense of how this looks at scale.": 1,
    " So what you're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas in this case.": 1,
    "It's a waste product.": 1,
    "And what they're doing in our equipment is going through a continuous system.": 1,
    " which cleans, cooks, cools, and pasteurizes these materials while also continuously inoculating them with armicillium.": 1,
    " This gives us a continuous stream of material that we can put into almost any shape, though today we're making corner blocks.": 1,
    "And it's when this lid goes on the part that the magic really starts.": 1,
    "Because the manufacturing process is our organism.": 1,
    " It'll actually begin to digest these ag wastes, and over the next five days, assemble them into biop composites.": 1,
    "Our entire facility": 1,
    " It's comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools sitting indoors in the dark quietly self-assembling materials and everything from building materials to in this case a packaging corner block.": 1,
    " So I've said a number of times that we grow materials, and it's kind of hard to picture how that happens.": 1,
    "So my team has taken five days worth of growth, a typical growth cycle for us, and condensed it into a 15 second time lapse.": 1,
    " And I want you to really watch closely these little white dots on the screen.": 1,
    "Because over the five-day period, what they do is extend out and through this material, using the energy that's contained in these seed husks to build this chitinous polymer matrix.": 1,
    " This matrix self-assembles, growing through and around the particles, making millions and millions of tiny fibers.": 1,
    "And what parts of the seed husk we don't digest actually become part of the final physical composite.": 1,
    " So in front of your eyes, this part just self-assembled.": 1,
    "It actually takes a little longer.": 1,
    "It takes five days.": 1,
    "But it's much faster than conventional farming.": 1,
    " The last step, of course, is application.": 1,
    "In this case, we've grown a corner block.": 1,
    "A major Fortune 500 furniture maker uses these corner blocks to protect their tables and shipment.": 1,
    "They used to use a plastic packaging buffer.": 1,
    " but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance with our grown material.": 1,
    "Best of all,": 1,
    " When it gets to the customer, it's not trash, right?": 1,
    "They can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing, and it's going to improve the local soil.": 1,
    "So why mausoleum?": 1,
    "Well, the first reason is local open feed stocks.": 1,
    " You want to be able to do this anywhere in the world and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls because you have multiple choices.": 1,
    "The next is self-assembly because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process.": 1,
    "You don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility.": 1,
    " so you can have lots of small facilities spread all across the world.": 1,
    "Biological yield is really important, and because 100% of what we put in the tool becomes the final product, even the parts that aren't digested become part of the structure, we're getting incredible yield rates.": 1,
    " natural polymers?": 1,
    "Well, I think that's what's most important.": 1,
    "Because these polymers have been tried and tested in our ecosystem for the last billion years.": 1,
    "And everything from mushrooms to crustaceans.": 1,
    "They're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems.": 1,
    "They work great.": 1,
    "And while today": 1,
    " we can practically guarantee that yesterday's packaging is going to be here in 10,000 years.": 1,
    "What I want to guarantee is that in 10,000 years, our descendants, our children's children, will be living happily and in harmony with a healthy Earth.": 1,
    " And I think that can be some really good news.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
