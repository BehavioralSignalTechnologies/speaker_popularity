    " These are my words, but this is not my voice.": 1,
    "This is Alex, the best computer voice I've been able to find, which comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh.": 1,
    " For most of my life I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak.": 1,
    "It was like breathing.": 1,
    "In those days, I was living in a fool's paradise.": 1,
    " After surgeries for cancer took away my ability to speak, eat or drink, I was forced to enter this virtual world in which a computer does some of my living for me.": 1,
    " For several days now we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED.": 1,
    "I used to be able to talk like that.": 1,
    "Maybe I wasn't as smart, but I was at least as talkative.": 1,
    " I want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself, and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one's identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away.": 1,
    "However,": 1,
    " I found that listening to a computer voice for any great length of time can be monotonous.": 1,
    "So, I've decided to recruit some of my TED friends to read my words aloud for me.": 1,
    "I will start with my wife, Chaz.": 1,
    " It was Chas who stood by my side through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw and restore my ability to speak.": 1,
    " Going into the first surgery for a recurrence of salivary cancer in 2006, I expected to be out of the hospital in time to return to my movie review show, Ebert and Roper at the Movies.": 1,
    " I had pre-taped enough shows to get me through six weeks of surgery and recuperation.": 1,
    "The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw.": 1,
    " My tongue, larynx, and vocal cords were still healthy and unaffected.": 1,
    " I was optimistic and all was right with the world.": 1,
    " The first surgery was a great success.": 1,
    "I saw myself in the mirror and I looked pretty good.": 1,
    "Two weeks later, I was ready to return home.": 1,
    " I was using my iPod to play the Leonard Cohen song, I'm Your Man, for my doctors and nurses.": 1,
    " Suddenly, I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding.": 1,
    "My carotid artery had ruptured.": 1,
    " Thank God I was still in my hospital room and my doctors were right there.": 1,
    " Chas told me that if that song hadn't played for so long, I might have already been in the car on the way home and would have died right there and then.": 1,
    "So thank you, Leonard Cohen, for saving my life.": 1,
    " There was a second surgery, it was held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart.": 1,
    " And then a third attempt, which also patched me back together pretty well until it failed.": 1,
    " A doctor from Brazil said he had never seen anyone survive a carotid artery rupture.": 1,
    "And before I left the hospital, after a year of being hospitalized,": 1,
    " I had seven ruptures of my carotid artery.": 1,
    "There was no particular day when anyone told me I would never speak again.": 1,
    "It just sort of became obvious.": 1,
    " Human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system.": 1,
    " We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath in order to form sounds.": 1,
    "Therefore, the system must be essentially airtight in order to capture air.": 1,
    " Because I had lost my jaw, I could no longer form a seal, and therefore my tongue and all of my other vocal equipment was rendered powerless.": 1,
    " At first, for a long time, I wrote messages in notebooks.": 1,
    "Then I tried typing words on my laptop and using its built-in voice.": 1,
    "This was faster, and nobody had to try to read my handwriting.": 1,
    " I tried out various computer voices that were available online and for several months I had a British accent which Chaz called Sir Lawrence.": 1,
    " It was the clearest I could find.": 1,
    "Then Apple released the Alex voice, which was the best I'd heard.": 1,
    "It knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark.": 1,
    "When it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air.": 1,
    " There are all sorts of HTML codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices, and I've experimented with them.": 1,
    "For me, they share a fundamental problem.": 1,
    "They're too slow.": 1,
    " When I find myself in a conversational situation, I need to type fast and to jump right in.": 1,
    " People don't have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase.": 1,
    "But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice?": 1,
    "How does that affect who you are as a person?": 1,
    " When people hear Alex speaking my words, do they experience a disconnect?": 1,
    "Does that create a separation or a distance from one person to the next?": 1,
    " How did I feel not being able to speak?": 1,
    "I felt and I still feel a lot of distance from the human mainstream.": 1,
    "I become uncomfortable when I'm separated from my laptop.": 1,
    "Even then I'm aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties.": 1,
    " So, Chaz suggested finding a company that can make a customized voice using my TV show voice from a period of 30 years.": 1,
    "At first, I was against it.": 1,
    "I thought it would be creepy to hear my own voice coming from a computer.": 1,
    " There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own.": 1,
    "But I decided then to just give it a try.": 1,
    "So I contacted a company in Scotland that created personalized computer voices.": 1,
    " They'd never made one from previously recorded materials.": 1,
    "All of their voices had been made by a speaker recording original words in a control booth.": 1,
    "But they were willing to give it a try.": 1,
    " So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice, including several audio commentary tracks that I'd made for movies on DVDs.": 1,
    "And it sounded like me.": 1,
    "It really did.": 1,
    "There was a reason for that.": 1,
    "It was me.": 1,
    " But it wasn't that simple.": 1,
    "The tapes from my TV show weren't very useful because there were too many other kinds of audio involved.": 1,
    "Movie soundtracks, for example, or Gene Siskel arguing with me.": 1,
    " and my words often had a particular emphasis that didn't fit into a sentence well enough.": 1,
    "I'll let you hear a sample of that voice.": 1,
    "These are a few of the comments I recorded for you when Chas and I appeared on the Oprah Winfrey program.": 1,
    " And here's the voice we call Roger Junior or Roger 2.0.": 1,
    " Oprah, I can't tell you how great it is to be back on your show.": 1,
    "We have been talking for a long time.": 1,
    "And now, here we are again.": 1,
    "This is the first version of my computer voice that still needs improvement.": 1,
    " but at least it sounds like me and not like how my thousand when I heard it the first time it sent chills down my spine when I type anything": 1,
    " This voice will speak whatever I type.": 1,
    "When I read something, it will read in my voice.": 1,
    "I had typed these words in advance, as I didn't think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing.": 1,
    " The voice was created by a company in Scotland named Sarah Croc.": 1,
    "It makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while I was commenting on Casablanca and Citizen Kane.": 1,
    " created for an individual.": 1,
    "There are several very good voices available for computers, but they all sound like somebody else.": 1,
    "While this voice sounds like me,": 1,
    " I plan to use it on television, radio, and the internet.": 1,
    "People who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems.": 1,
    " Many blind people use them to read pages on the web for themselves.": 1,
    "But I gotta say, in first grade, they said I talk too much, and now I still can.": 1,
    " As you can hear, it sounds like me, but the words jump up and down.": 1,
    "The flow isn't natural.": 1,
    "The good people in Scotland are still improving my voice and I'm optimistic about it.": 1,
    " But so far, the Apple Alex voice is the best one I've heard.": 1,
    "I wrote a blog about it, and actually got a comment from the actor who played Alex.": 1,
    "He said he recorded many long hours in various intonations to be used in the voice.": 1,
    " A very large sample is needed.": 1,
    "All my life I was a motormoth.": 1,
    " Now I have spoken my last words and I don't even remember for sure what they were.": 1,
    "I feel like the hero of that Harlan Ellison story titled, I have no mouth and I must scream.": 1,
    " On Wednesday, David Christian explained to us what a tiny instant the human race represents in the time span of the universe.": 1,
    "For almost all of its millions and billions of years, there was no life on earth at all.": 1,
    " For almost all the years of life on earth, there was no intelligent life.": 1,
    "Only after we learned to pass knowledge from one generation to the next,": 1,
    " Does civilization become possible?": 1,
    "In cosmological terms, that was about 10 minutes ago.": 1,
    "Finally came mankind's most advanced and mysterious tool, the computer.": 1,
    " That has mostly happened in my lifetime.": 1,
    "Some of the famous early computers were being built in my hometown of Urbana, the birthplace of HAL 9000.": 1,
    " When I heard the amazing talk by Salman Khan on Wednesday about the Khan Academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world, I had a flashback.": 1,
    " It was about 1960.": 1,
    "As a local newspaper reporter still in high school, I was sent over to the computer lab of the University of Illinois to interview the creators of something called Plato.": 1,
    " The initials stood for Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations.": 1,
    "This was a computer-assisted instruction system, which in those days ran on a computer named Iliac.": 1,
    " The program has said it could assist students in their learning.": 1,
    "I doubt on that day, 50 years ago, they even dreamed of what Salman Khan has accomplished.": 1,
    " But that's not the point.": 1,
    "The point is, Plato was only 50 years ago, an instant in time.": 1,
    "It continued to evolve and operated in one form or another on more and more sophisticated computers until only five years ago.": 1,
    " I have learned from Wikipedia that starting with that humble beginning, Plato established forums, message boards, online testing, email, chat rooms,": 1,
    " picture languages, instant messaging, remote screen sharing, and multiplayer games.": 1,
    "Since the first web browser was also developed in Urbana,": 1,
    " It appears that my hometown in downstate Illinois was the birthplace of much of the virtual online universe we occupy today.": 1,

    " I was in line at Radio Shack to buy one of the first Model 100s, and when I told the people in the press room at the Academy Awards that they'd better install some phone lines for internet connections, they didn't know what I was talking about.": 1,
    " When I bought my first desktop, it was a deck rainbow.": 1,
