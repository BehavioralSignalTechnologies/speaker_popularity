    " Thank you.": 2,
    " Allow me to start this talk with a question to everyone.": 1,
    " You know that all over the world people fight for their freedom, fight for their rights.": 1,
    "Some battle oppressive governments.": 1,
    "Others battle oppressive societies.": 1,
    " Which battle do you think is harder?": 1,
    " Allow me to try to answer this question in the few coming minutes.": 1,
    " Let me take you back two years ago in my life.": 1,
    " It was the bedtime of my son Aboudi.": 1,
    " He was five at the time.": 1,
    " After finishing his bedtime rituals, he looked at me and he asked a question.": 1,
    " Mommy, are we about people?": 1,
    "I was shocked.": 1,
    " Why do you say such thing, Erbudi?": 1,
    " Any other day, I noticed some bruises on his face when he came from school.": 1,
    "He wouldn't tell me what happened.": 1,
    "He was ready to tell.": 1,
    " Two boys hit me today in school.": 1,
    "They told me we saw your mom on Facebook.": 1,
    "You and your mom should be put in jail.": 1,
    " I've never been afraid to tell Aboudi anything.": 1,
    "I've been always a proud woman of my achievements.": 1,
    " But those questioning eyes of my son were my moment of truth when it all came together.": 1,
    " You see, I'm a Saudi woman who's been put to jail for driving a car in a country where women are not supposed to drive cars.": 1,
    " just for giving me his car keys, my own brother.": 1,
    " was detained twice and he was harassed to the point he had to quit his job as a geologist, leave the country with his wife and two-year-old son.": 1,
    " My father had to sit in a Friday sermon listening to the Imam, condemning women drivers and calling them prostitutes.": 1,
    "Amongst tens of worshippers, some of them are friends and family of my own father.": 1,
    " I was faced with organized defamation campaign in the local media combined with false rumors shared in family gatherings in the streets and in schools.": 1,
    " It all hit me.": 1,
    "It came into focus that those kids were not meant to be rude to my son.": 1,
    "They were just influenced by the adults around them.": 1,
    " And it wasn't about me.": 1,
    "And it wasn't a punishment for taking the wheel and driving a few miles.": 1,
    "It was a punishment for daring to challenge the society's rules.": 1,
    " But my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mind.": 1,
    "Allow me to give you a very brief thing about my story.": 1,
    " It was May 2011, and I was complaining to a work colleague about the harassment I had to face trying to find a ride back home, although I have a car and international driver's license.": 1,
    " As long as I know, women in Saudi Arabia have been always complaining about the ban.": 1,
    "But it's been 20 years since anyone tried to do anything about it, a whole generation ago.": 1,
    "He broke the good-bad news in my face.": 1,
    " but there is no law banning you from driving.": 1,
    " I looked it up, and he was right.": 1,
    "There wasn't actual law inside Arabia.": 1,
    "It was just a custom and traditions that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas and imposed on women.": 1,
    " That realization ignited the idea of June 17, where we encouraged women to take the wheel and go drive.": 1,
    " It was a few weeks later, we started receiving all these men walls that would rape you if you go and drive.": 1,
    "A courageous woman, her name is Najla Hariri, she's a Saudi woman in the city of Jeddah.": 1,
    " She drove a car and she announced, but she didn't record the video.": 1,
    "We needed proof.": 1,
    " So I drove, I posted a video on YouTube, and for my surprise, it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day.": 1,
    "What happened next?": 1,
    "Of course, I started receiving threats to be killed, raped, just to stop this campaign.": 1,
    " The Saudi authorities remained very quiet that really creeped us out.": 1,
    "I was in the campaign with other Saudi women and even men activists.": 1,
    "We wanted to know how the authorities": 1,
    " will respond on the actual day, June 17, with women, go out and drive.": 1,
    "So this time I asked my brother to come with me and drive by a police car.": 1,
    "It went fast.": 1,
    " We were arrested, signed a pledge not to drive again, released, arrested again.": 1,
    "He was sent to detention for one day and I was sent to jail.": 1,
    " I wasn't sure why I was sent there because I didn't face any charges in the interrogation.": 1,
    "But what I was sure of, of my innocence, I didn't break a law.": 1,
    "And I kept my abaya.": 1,
    "It's a black clock we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house.": 1,
    " and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off.": 1,
    "But I was so sure of my innocence, I kept saying, no, I'm leaving today.": 1,
    " Outside the jail, the whole country went into a frenzy, some attacking me badly, and others supportive and even collecting signatures in a petition to be sent to the king to release me.": 1,
    " I was released after nine days.": 1,
    "June 17th comes.": 1,
    "The streets were packed with police cars and religious police cars.": 1,
    " But some hundred brave Saudi women broke the ban and drove that day.": 1,
    "None were arrested.": 1,
    "We broke the table.": 1,
    " So I think by now, everyone knows that we can drive, or women are not allowed to drive inside of Arabia, but maybe few knows why.": 1,
    "Allow me to help you answer this question.": 1,
    " There was this official study that was presented to the Shura Council.": 1,
    "It's the consultative council appointed by the king inside Arabia.": 1,
    " And it was done by a local professor, a university professor.": 1,
    "He claims it's done based on a UNESCO study.": 1,
    "And the study states,": 1,
    " The percentage of rape, adultery, illegitimate children, even drug abuse, prostitution in countries where women drive is higher than countries where women don't drive.": 1,
    " I know, I was like this, I was shocked, I was like, we are the last country in the world where women don't drive.": 1,
    "So if you look at the map of the world, it only leaves two countries, Saudi Arabia and the other societies, the rest of the world.": 1,
    " We started a hashtag on Twitter mocking the study, and it made headlines around the world.": 1,
    " And only then we realize it's so empowering to mock your oppressor, it strips it away of its strongest weapon, fear.": 1,
    " This system is based on ultra-conservative traditions and customs, deal with mumin as they are inferior, and they need a guardian to protect them.": 1,
    " So they need to take permission from this guidance, whether verbal or written, all their lives.": 1,
    "We're minors until the day we die.": 1,
    "And it becomes worse when it's enshrined in religious fatwas based on wrong interpretation of the Sharia law or the religious laws.": 1,
    " What's worse, when they become codified as laws in the system, and when women themselves believe in that inferiority, and they even fight those who try to": 1,
    " question these rules.": 1,
    " So for me, it wasn't only about these attacks I had to face.": 1,
    "It was about living two totally different perceptions of my personality, of my person, the villain back in my home country, and the hero outside.": 1,
    " Just to tell you, two stories happened in the last two years.": 1,
    "One of them is when I was in jail.": 1,
    "I'm pretty sure when I was in jail, everyone saw titles in the international media, something like this.": 1,
    " during these nine days I was in jail.": 1,
    "But in my home country, it was a totally different picture.": 1,
    "It was more like this.": 1,
    "Manala Sharif faces charges of disturbing public order and inciting women to drive.": 1,
    "I know.": 1,
    " Manala Sharif withdraws from the campaign.": 1,
    "It's okay.": 1,
    "This is my favorite.": 1,
    "Manala Sharif breaks down and confesses foreign forces incited me.": 1,
    " And it goes on even trial and flogging me in public.": 1,
    "So it's such a different picture.": 1,
    "I was asked last year to give a speech in also Freedom Forum.": 1,
    " I was surrounded by this love and support of people around me.": 1,
    "And they looked at me as an inspiration.": 1,
    "At the same time, I flew back to my home country.": 1,
    " They hated that speech so much, the way they called it a betrayal to the Saudi country and the Saudi people.": 1,
    "And they even started a hashtag called Oslo Traitor on Twitter.": 1,
    "Some 10,000 tweets were written in that hashtag.": 1,
    " While the opposite hashtag, Oslo Hero, there was like a handful of tweets written.": 1,
    "They even started a poll.": 1,
    "More than 13,000 voters answered this poll, whether they considered me traitor or not after that speech.": 1,
    " 90% said yes, she's a traitor.": 1,
    "So it's these two totally different perception of my personality.": 1,
    " For me, I'm a proud-side woman, and I do love my country.": 1,
    "And because I love my country, I'm doing this.": 1,
    "Because I believe a society would not be free if women of that society are not free.": 1,
    " But you learn lessons from these things that happen to you.": 1,
    "I learn to be always there.": 1,
    "The first thing I got out of jail, after I took a shower, I went online.": 1,
    "I opened my Twitter account and my Facebook page.": 1,
    " And I've been always very respectful to those people who are opening to me.": 1,
    "I would listen to what they say.": 1,
    "And I would never defend myself with words only.": 1,
    "I would use actions.": 1,
    "When they said I would withdraw from the campaign,": 1,
    " I filed the first lawsuit against the General Directorate of Traffic Police for not issuing me a driver's license.": 1,
    " There are a lot of people also very big supporters, like those 3,000 people who signed the petition to release me.": 1,
    "We sent a petition to the Shura Council in favor of lifting the ban on side women.": 1,
    " And there were like 3,500 citizens believed in that and they signed that petition.": 1,
    "There are people like that, I just showed some sample, who are amazing.": 1,
    " who are believing in women's rights in Saudi Arabia and trying, and they're also facing a lot of hate because of speaking up and voicing their views.": 1,
    " Saudi Arabia today is taking small steps toward enhancing women's rights.": 1,
    "The Shura Council that's appointed by the king, by Royal Decree of King Abdullah, last year there were 30 women assigned to that council, like 20%.": 1,
    " 20% of the council.": 1,
    "The same time, finally, that council, after rejecting our petition four times for women driving, they finally accepted it last February.": 1,
    " After being sent to jail or sentenced to a trial, the spokesperson of the traffic police said we will only issue traffic violations for women drivers.": 1,
    " The Grand Mufti, who was the head of the religious establishment inside Arabia, he said, it's not recommended for women to drive.": 1,
    "It used to be haram, forbidden by the previous Grand Mufti.": 1,
    " So, for me, it's not about all of these small steps.": 1,
    "It's about women themselves.": 1,
    "A friend once asked me, she said, so when do you think this woman driving will happen?": 1,
    " I told her only if women stop asking when and take action to make it now.": 1,
    "So it's not only about the system, it's also about us women to drive our own life, I'd say.": 1,
    " So I have no clue really how I become an activist.": 1,
    " And I don't know how I became one now.": 1,
    "But all I know, and all I'm sure of in the future, when someone asks me,": 1,
    " ask me my story, I will say, I'm proud to be amongst those women who lived the bad, fought the bad, and celebrated everyone's freedom.": 1,
    " So, the question I started my talk with, who do you think is more difficult to face?": 1,
    "Oppressive governments or oppressive societies?": 1,
    "I hope you find clues to answer that from my speech.": 1,
    "Thank you, everyone.": 1
