    " A month ago today, I stood there.": 1,
    " 90 degrees south, the top of the bottom of the world, the geographic self-pole, and I stood there beside two very good friends of mine, Richard Weber and Kevin Valleley.": 1,
    "Together we had just broken the world speed record for a trek to the self-pole.": 1,
    " Took us 33 days, 23 hours, and 55 minutes to get there.": 1,
    "We shaved five days off the previous best.": 1,
    " time, and in the process I became the first person in history to make the entire 650 mile journey from Hercules Inlet to South Pole solely on feet without skis.": 1,
    " Now many of you are probably saying, wait a sec, is this tough to do?": 1,
    " Imagine, if you will, dragging a sled, as you just saw in that video clip, with 170 pounds of gear and everything you need to survive.": 1,
    " On your Antarctic track it's going to be 40 below.": 1,
    "Every single day you'll be in a massive headwind and at some point you're going to have to cross these cracks in the ice, these crevasses.": 1,
    " Some of them have a very precarious thin foot bridge underneath them that could give way at a moment's notice, taking your sled you into the abyss never to be seen again.": 1,
    "The punchline to your journey?": 1,
    "Look at the horizon.": 1,
    " Yes, it's uphill the entire way because the south pole is at 10,000 feet and you're starting at sea level.": 1,
    " Our journey, in fact, did not begin at Hercules Inlet, where frozen ocean meets the land of Antarctica.": 1,
    "It began a little less than two years ago.": 1,
    "A couple of buddies of mine and I had finished a 111-day run across the entire Sahara Desert.": 1,
    " And while we were there, we learned the seriousness of the water crisis in northern Africa.": 1,
    "We also learned that many of the issues facing the people in northern Africa affected young people the most.": 1,
    " came home to my wife after 111 days of running in the sand and I said, you know, there's no doubt if this bozo can get across the desert, we are capable of doing anything we set our minds to.": 1,
    "But if I'm going to continue doing these adventures, there has to be a reason.": 1,
    " for me to do them, beyond just getting there.": 1,
    " Around that time, I met an extraordinary human being, Peter Thum, who inspired me with his actions.": 1,
    "He's trying to find and solve water issues, the crisis around the world.": 1,
    " This dedication inspired me to come up with this expedition, a run to the South Pole where with an interactive website I would be able to bring young people, students and teachers from around the world on board the expedition with me as active members.": 1,
    " So we would have a live website that every single day of the 33 days we would be blogging telling stories of depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces or we will burn.": 1,
    " Crossing miles and miles of sestrugi, frozen ice snow drifts that could be hip deep.": 1,
    "I'm telling you, crossing these things with a 170-pound sled, that sled may as well have weighed 1,700 pounds, because that's what it felt like.": 1,
    " We were blogging to this live website daily to these students that were tracking us as well, about 10-hour tracking days, 15-hour tracking days.": 1,
    " sometimes 20 hours of trekking daily to meet our goal.": 1,
    "We catch cat naps at 40 below on our sled, incidentally.": 1,
    " In turn, students, people from around the world would ask us questions.": 1,
    "Young people ask the most amazing questions, one of my favorite.": 1,
    "It's 40 below, you gotta go to the bathroom.": 1,
    "Where are you gonna go and how are you gonna do it?": 1,
    " I'm not going to answer that, but I will answer some of the more popular questions.": 1,
    "Where do you sleep?": 1,
    "We slept in a tent that was very low to the ground because the winds on Antarctica were so extreme it would blow anything else away.": 1,
    " What do you eat?": 1,
    "One of my favourite dishes on expedition, butter and bacon.": 1,
    "It's about a million calories.": 1,
    "We were burning about 8,500 a day, so we needed it.": 1,
    " How many batteries do you carry for all the equipment you have?": 1,
    "Virtually none.": 1,
    "All of our equipment, including film equipment, was charged by the sun.": 1,
    "And do you get along?": 1,
    " I certainly hope so because at some point or another on this expedition, one of your teammates is going to have to take a very big needle and put it in an infected blister and drain it for you.": 1,
    " But seriously, we did get along because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people.": 1,
    "They were our teammates.": 1,
    "They were inspiring us.": 1,
    "The stories we were hearing": 1,
    " got us to the South Pole.": 1,
    "The website worked brilliantly as a two-way street of communication.": 1,
    "Young people in Northern Canada, kids in an elementary school, dragging sleds across the schoolyard pretending they were Richard, Ray, and Kevin.": 1,
    " Amazing.": 1,
    "We arrived at the South Pole, we huddled into that tent, 45 below that day, I'll never forget it.": 1,
    "We looked at each other with these, these looks of disbelief at what we had just completed.": 1,
    " And I remember looking at the guys thinking, what do I take from this journey, you know, seriously?": 1,
    "That I'm this Uber endurance guy?": 1,
    " As I stand here today talking to you guys, I've been running for the grand sum of five years, and a year before that, I was a pack a day smoker living a very sedentary lifestyle.": 1,
    "What I take from this journey, from my journeys, is that in fact,": 1,
    " Within every fiber of my belief standing here, I know that we can make the impossible possible.": 1,
    "I'm learning this at 40.": 1,
    "Can you imagine?": 1,
    "Seriously, can you imagine?": 1,
    " I'm learning this at 40 years of age.": 1,
    "Imagine being 13 years old, hearing those words and believing it.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
