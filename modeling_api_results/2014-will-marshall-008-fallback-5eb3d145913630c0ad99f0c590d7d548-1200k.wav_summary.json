    "Thank you.": 3,
    " The Earth needs no introduction.": 1,
    "It needs no introduction in part because the Apollo 17 astronauts, when they were hurtling around the moon in 1972, took this iconic image.": 1,
    " It galvanized a whole generation of human beings to realize that we're on spaceship Earth, fragile and finite as it is, and that we need to take care of it.": 1,
    "But while this picture is beautiful, it's static, and the Earth is constantly changing.": 1,
    " It's changing on days time scales with human activity.": 1,
    "And the satellite imagery we have of it today is old, typically years old.": 1,
    "And that's important because you can't fix what you can't see.": 1,
    " What we'd ideally want is images of the whole planet every day.": 1,
    " So what's standing in our way?": 1,
    "What's the problem?": 1,
    " This is the problem.": 1,
    "Satellites are big, expensive, and they're slow.": 1,
    "This one weighs three tons.": 1,
    " It's six meters tall, four meters wide.": 1,
    "It took up the entire fairing of a rocket just to launch it.": 1,
    "One satellite, one rocket.": 1,
    "It cost $855 million.": 1,
    " Satellites like these have done an amazing job at helping us to understand our planet.": 1,
    " But if we want to understand it much more regularly...": 1,
    " We need lots of satellites, and this model isn't scalable.": 1,
    "So me and my friends, we started Planet Labs to make satellites ultra compact and small and highly capable.": 1,
    "I'm going to show you what our satellite looks like.": 1,
    " This is our satellite.": 1,
    " This is not the scale model.": 1,
    "This is the real size.": 1,
    "It's 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters.": 1,
    "It weighs 4 kilograms.": 1,
    "And we've stuffed the latest and greatest electronics and sensor systems into this little package.": 1,
    "So that even though this is really small,": 1,
    " This can take pictures ten times the resolution of the big satellite here, even though it weighs one thousandth of the mass.": 1,
    " And we call this Satellite Dove.": 1,
    " We call this satellite Dove, and we call it Dove because satellites are typically named after birds, but normally birds are prey, like eagle, hawk, swoop, kill, I don't know, kestrel, eye, these sort of things.": 1,
    "But ours have a humanitarian mission, so we wanted to call them Doves.": 1,
    " And we haven't just built them, though.": 1,
    "We've launched them.": 1,
    "And not just one, but many.": 1,
    " It all started in our garage.": 1,
    "Yes, we built our first satellite prototype in our garage.": 1,
    "Now, this is pretty normal for a Silicon Valley company that we are, but we believe it's the first time for a space company.": 1,
    " And that's not the only trick we learned from Silicon Valley.": 1,
    "We rapidly prototype our satellite.": 1,
    "We use early release often on our software.": 1,
    " And we take a different risk approach.": 1,
    "We take them out and outside and test them.": 1,
    "We even put satellites in space just to test the satellites.": 1,
    "And we've learned to manufacture our satellites at scale.": 1,
    "We've used modern production techniques so we can build large numbers of them.": 1,
    " I think for the first time.": 1,
    "We call it Agile Aerospace.": 1,
    " And that's what's enabled us to put so much capability into this little box.": 1,
    " Now, what has bonded our team over the years?": 1,
    " is the idea of democratizing access to satellite information.": 1,
    " In fact, the founders of our company, Chris, Robbie and I, we met over 15 years ago at the United Nations when they were hosting a conference about exactly that question.": 1,
    "How do you use satellites to help humanity?": 1,
    "How do you use satellites to help people in developing countries or with climate change?": 1,
    " And this is what has bonded us.": 1,
    "Our entire team is passionate about using satellites to help humanity.": 1,
    "You could say we're space geeks, but not only do we care about what's up there, we care about what's down here too.": 1,
    " I'm going to show you a video from just four weeks ago of two of our satellites being launched from the International Space Station.": 1,
    " This is not an animation.": 1,
    "This is a video taken by the astronaut looking out of the window.": 1,
    "Gives you a bit of a sense of scale of our two satellites.": 1,
    "It's like some of the smallest satellites ever being launched from the biggest satellite ever.": 1,
    " And right at the end, the solar ray glints in the sun.": 1,
    "It's really cool.": 1,
    "Wait for it.": 1,
    "Boom!": 1,
    "It's like the money shot.": 1,
    " So we didn't just launch two of them like this, we launched 28 of them.": 1,
    "It's the largest constellation of Earth imaging satellites in human history, and it's going to provide a completely radical new data set about our changing planet.": 1,
    "But that's just the beginning.": 1,
    " You see, we're going to launch more than a hundred of these satellites like these over the course of the next year.": 1,
    "It's going to be the largest constellation of satellites in human history, and this is what it's going to do.": 1,
    "Acting in a single orbit plane that stays fixed with respect to the sun,": 1,
    " the Earth rotates underneath.": 1,
    "They're all cameras pointed down, and they slowly scan across as the Earth rotates underneath.": 1,
    "The Earth rotates every 24 hours, so we scan every point on the planet every 24 hours.": 1,
    "It's a line scanner for the planet.": 1,
    " We don't take a picture of anywhere on the planet every day, we take a picture of every single place on the planet every day.": 1,
    "Even though we launched these just a couple of weeks ago, we've already got some initial imagery from the satellites, and I'm going to show it publicly for the first time right now.": 1,
    " This is the very first picture taken by a satellite.": 1,
    "It happened to be over UC Davis campus in California when we turned the camera on.": 1,
    " But what's even cooler is when we compare it to the previous latest image of that area, which was taken many months ago.": 1,
    "And the image on the left is from our satellite.": 1,
    "And we see buildings that have been built.": 1,
    " The general point is that we'll be able to track urban growth as it happens around the whole world in all cities every day.": 1,
    " Water as well.": 1,
    " We'll be able to see the extent of all water bodies around the whole world every day and help water security.": 1,
    "From water security to food security.": 1,
    " We'll seed crops as they grow in all the fields on every farmer's field around the plant every day and help them to improve crop yield.": 1,
    " This is a beautiful image that was taken just a few hours ago when a satellite was flying over Argentina.": 1,
    "The general point is,": 1,
    " There are probably hundreds and thousands of applications of this data.": 1,
    "I've mentioned a few, but there's others.": 1,
    "Deforestation, the ice caps melting.": 1,
    "We can track all these things.": 1,
    "Every tree on the planet, every day.": 1,
    " If you took the difference between today's image and yesterday's image, you'd see much of the world news.": 1,
    "You'd see floods and fires and earthquakes.": 1,
    "And we have decided, therefore, that the best thing that we could do with our data is to ensure universal access to it.": 1,
    " We want to ensure everyone can see it.": 1,
    " We want to empower NGOs and companies and scientists and journalists to be able to answer the questions that they have about the planet.": 1,
    "We want to enable the developer community to run their apps on our data.": 1,
    " In short, we want to democratise access to information about our planet.": 1,
    " Which brings me back to this.": 1,
    "You see, this will be an entirely new global data set.": 1,
    "And we believe that together we can help to take care of our spaceship Earth.": 1,
    " And what I would like to leave you with is the following question.": 1,
    "If you had access to imagery of the whole planet every single day, what would you do with that data?": 1,
    "What problems would you solve?": 1,
    "What exploration would you do?": 1,
    " I invite you to come and explore with us.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
