    " Intelligence.": 1,
    "What is it?": 1,
    " If we take a look back at the history of how intelligence has been viewed, one seminal example has been Edgar Dijkstra's famous quote that the question of whether a machine can think": 1,
    " is about as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim.": 1,
    " Now, Edgar Dijkstra, when he wrote this, intended it as a criticism of the early pioneers of computer science, like Alan Turing.": 1,
    "However, if you take a look back,": 1,
    " And think about what have been the most empowering innovations that enabled us to build artificial machines that swim and artificial machines that think.": 1,
    " You find that it was only through understanding the underlying physical mechanisms of swimming and flight that we were able to build these machines.": 1,
    " And so, several years ago, I undertook a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.": 1,
    "Let's take a step back.": 1,
    " Let's first begin with a thought experiment.": 1,
    "Pretend that you're an alien race that doesn't know anything about earth biology, or earth neuroscience, or earth intelligence.": 1,
    " But you have amazing telescopes, and you're able to watch the Earth, and you have amazingly long lives.": 1,
    "So you're able to watch the Earth over millions, even billions of years.": 1,
    " And you observe a really strange effect.": 1,
    "You observe that over the course of the millennia, Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids.": 1,
    " up until a point, and that at some point, corresponding roughly to our year, 2000 AD, asteroids that are on a collision course with the Earth": 1,
    " that otherwise would have collided mysteriously get deflected or they detonate before they can hit the earth.": 1,
    " Now, of course, as Earthlings, we know the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.": 1,
    "We're trying to prevent an impact.": 1,
    " But if you're an alien race, doesn't know any of this, doesn't have any concept of earth intelligence, you'd be forced to put together a physical theory that explains how, up until a certain point in time,": 1,
    " asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet mysteriously stop doing that.": 1,
    "And so I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.": 1,
    " So in this program that I undertook several years ago, I looked at a variety of different threads across science, across a variety of disciplines that were pointing, I think, towards a single underlying mechanism for intelligence.": 1,
    " In cosmology, for example, there have been a variety of different threads of evidence that our universe appears to be finely tuned for the development of intelligence and in particular for the development of": 1,
    " universal states that maximize the diversity of possible futures.": 1,
    "In gameplay, for example in Go, everyone remembers in 1997 when IBM's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov at chess.": 1,
    " Fewer people are aware that in the past 10 years or so, the game of Go, arguably a much more challenging game because it has a much higher branching factor, has also started to succumb to computer game players for the same reason.": 1,
    " The best techniques right now for computers play and go are techniques that try to maximize future options during game play.": 1,
    " Finally, in robotic motion planning, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to take advantage of abilities of robots to maximize future freedom of action in order to accomplish complex tasks.": 1,
    " And so taking all of these different threads and putting them together, I asked, starting several years ago, is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can factor out of all of these different threads?": 1,
    " Is there a single equation for intelligence?": 1,
    " And the answer, I believe, is yes.": 1,
    "What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to an E equals MC squared for intelligence that I've seen.": 1,
    " So what you're seeing here is a statement of correspondence that intelligence is a force F.": 1,
    " that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action.": 1,
    "It acts to maximize future freedom of action or keep options open with some strength T.": 1,
    " with the diversity of possible accessible futures s up to some future time horizon tau.": 1,
    " In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped.": 1,
    "Intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action and keep options open.": 1,
    " And so given this one equation, it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?": 1,
    "How predictive is it?": 1,
    "Does it predict human level intelligence?": 1,
    "Does it predict artificial intelligence?": 1,
    "So I'm going to show you now a video that will": 1,
    " I think it demonstrates some of the amazing applications of just this single equation.": 1,
    " Recent research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or entropy, over their lifetimes should tend to have more favorable conditions": 1,
    " for the existence of intelligent beings such as ourselves.": 1,
    "But what if that tentative cosmological connection between entropy and intelligence hints at a deeper relationship?": 1,
    " What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate with the production of long-term entropy, but actually emerges directly from it?": 1,
    "To find out, we developed a software engine called Entropica.": 1,
    " designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy of any system that it finds itself in.": 1,
    " Entropica was able to pass multiple animal intelligence tests, play human games, and even earn money trading stocks, all without being instructed to do so.": 1,
    "Here are some examples of Entropica in action.": 1,
    " Just like a human standing upright without falling over, here we see Entropica automatically balancing a pole using a cart.": 1,
    "This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave Entropica a goal.": 1,
    "It simply decided on its own to balance the pole.": 1,
    " This balancing ability will have applications for humanoid robotics and human assistive technologies.": 1,
    "Just as some animals can use objects in their environments as tools to reach into narrow spaces,": 1,
    " Here we see that Entropica, again on its own initiative, was able to move a large disk representing an animal around so as to cause a small disk representing a tool": 1,
    " to reach into a confined space holding a third disk and release the third disk from its initially fixed position.": 1,
    "This tool use ability will have applications for smart manufacturing and agriculture.": 1,
    " In addition, just as some other animals are able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release food, here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish a model version of that task.": 1,
    " This cooperative ability has interesting implications for economic planning and a variety of other fields.": 1,
    " Entropica is broadly applicable to a variety of domains.": 1,
    "For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of Pong against itself, illustrating its potential for gaming.": 1,
    " Here we see Entropica orchestrating new connections on a social network where friends are constantly falling out of touch and successfully keeping the network well connected.": 1,
    "This same network orchestration ability also has applications in healthcare,": 1,
    " energy and intelligence.": 1,
    " Here we see Entropica directing the paths of a fleet of ships, successfully discovering and utilizing the Panama Canal to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.": 1,
    " By the same token, Entropica is broadly applicable to problems in autonomous defense, logistics, and transportation.": 1,
    " Finally, here we see Entropica spontaneously discovering and executing a buy low, sell high strategy on a simulated range traded stock, successfully growing assets under management exponentially.": 1,
    " This risk management ability will have broad applications in finance and insurance.": 1,
    " So what you've just seen is that a variety of signature human intelligent cognitive behaviors such as tool use and walking upright": 1,
    " and social cooperation all follow from a single equation which drives a system to maximize its future freedom of action.": 1,
    " Now, there's a profound irony here, going back to the beginning of the usage of the term robot.": 1,
    " the play RUR, R-U-R.": 1,
    "There was always a concept that if we developed machine intelligence, there would be a cybernetic revolt.": 1,
    "The machines would rise up against us.": 1,
    " One major consequence of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt in reverse.": 1,
    " It's not that machines first become intelligent and then megalomaniacal and try to take over the world.": 1,
    "It's quite the opposite.": 1,
    " that the urge to take control of all possible futures is a more fundamental principle than that of intelligence, that general intelligence may in fact emerge directly from this sort of": 1,
    " control grabbing rather than vice versa.": 1,
    " Another important consequence is goal seeking.": 1,
    "I'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals": 1,
    " follow from this sort of framework?": 1,
    "And the answer is the ability to seek goals will follow directly from this in the following sense.": 1,
    " just like you would travel through a tunnel, a bottleneck, in your future path space in order to achieve many other diverse objectives later on.": 1,
    " Or just like you would invest in a financial security, reducing your short-term liquidity in order to increase your wealth over the long term, goal seeking emerges directly from a long-term drive to increase future freedom of action.": 1,
    " Finally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist, once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed and you could pass only a single concept onto our descendants to help them rebuild civilization, that concept should be": 1,
    " that all matter around us is made out of tiny elements that attract each other when they're far apart, but repel each other when they're close together.": 1,
    " My equivalent of that statement, to pass on to descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them understand human intelligence, is the following.": 1,
    " Intelligence should be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in its own future.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
