    " This is arguably the back end of the design of animals.": 1,
    " But the reason I put this up here is because when I was in Africa last year, my wife and I were driving around.": 1,
    "We had this wonderful.": 1,
    " guide who showed us something that surprised both of us and it was very revealing in terms of the fascination that comes with the design of animals.": 1,
    "It turns out in about the 1880s the missionaries came to Africa": 1,
    " to spread the word of Christianity, to teach English to the natives, and they brought blackboards and chalk, and I'd like you to imagine that that's a blackboard and I just used some chalk on there.": 1,
    " And they brought quite a bit of this stuff, but over the years the blackboards were fine, but they ran out of chalk.": 1,
    "And this was a real crisis for them.": 1,
    "And that's where the hyena comes in.": 1,
    " Hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world.": 1,
    "It's stripped minds, carcasses, and it has amazing teeth because it enables the hyena to essentially eat bones.": 1,
    " The end product of that action is up on the board here.": 1,
    "And what the missionaries would do is they'd walk around": 1,
    " and they pick up hyena shit.": 1,
    "And the incredible thing about hyena shit is it makes great chalk.": 1,
    " Now, that's not what I'm here to talk about, but it is a fascinating aspect of animal design.": 1,
    "What I'm here to talk about is the camel.": 1,
    " When I started talking to Richard about what I was going to speak about, I had recently come back from Jordan where I had an amazing experience with a camel.": 1,
    " And we were in the desert.": 1,
    "That's the end of this talk.": 1,
    "Yeah, yeah.": 1,
    "We were in the desert in Wadi Rum.": 1,
    " and a small Jeep, there were four of us, two Bedouin drivers, and you can just imagine, this expanse is an ocean of sand, 105 degrees, one water bottle, and we were driving": 1,
    " And what they told us was their very, very best Jeep.": 1,
    "Didn't look like it to me.": 1,
    "And as we started to go through the desert, the Jeep broke down.": 1,
    " You guys got out, they put the hood up, they started working under the hood.": 1,
    "Got it going again, about a hundred yards, it broke down.": 1,
    "This went on about six or seven times and we were getting more and more alarmed and we were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert.": 1,
    " And eventually, our worst nightmare happened.": 1,
    "They flooded the engine.": 1,
    "And they said, no problem.": 1,
    "We just get out and walk.": 1,
    " We get out and walk.": 1,
    "One water bottle, remember, guys.": 1,
    "Four people.": 1,
    "They say, yeah, yeah, we'll walk.": 1,
    "We'll find some camels.": 1,
    " So we got out and walked, and sure enough, about half a mile, we came over the crest of this hill, and there was a huge gathering of Batamun with their camels.": 1,
    "The guy went up and started dickering, and ten dollars later, we had four camels.": 1,
    " They went down like elevators.": 1,
    "We got on them.": 1,
    "They went back up.": 1,
    "And the Bedouin, each Bedouin, four of them, got behind each of the camels with a little whip.": 1,
    " and they started slashing away at the back of the camels and they started galloping.": 1,
    "If you've ever been on a camel, it is a very, very uncomfortable ride.": 1,
    "There's also one other aspect about these camels.": 1,
    "About every ten steps, they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg.": 1,
    " So we kept on going and this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg and eventually three miles later we arrived at our destination where our Jeep was supposed to meet us and the camels come down again like elevators.": 1,
    " We sort of clumsily get off and they obviously try to take another chunk out of my leg.": 1,
    "And I've developed a very wonderful relationship with this creature by this point.": 1,
    "And I realized that this is a mean son of a bitch.": 1,
    " And much meaner, by the way, than the Bedouin who greeted me and tried to sell me one of his 26 daughters to take back to the States.": 1,
    " So as we talked, Richard and I, I said, you know, maybe I should bring a camel.": 1,
    "I think the camel's the best designed animal in the world.": 1,
    "And we kind of went, nah, I don't think we want to be bringing a camel.": 1,
    "And you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel.": 1,
    "So I did the next best thing.": 1,
    " I went to the Washington Zoo.": 1,
    "Richard said, I want you to get up close and personal with this camera.": 1,
    "I want you to inspect its mouth.": 1,
    " look at his teeth, go underneath it, go above it, go around it, pull its tail up, take a look in there.": 1,
    "I want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can.": 1,
    "So I got a National Geographic film crew.": 1,
    " We went down there and I took one look at this camel.": 1,
    " It is a 2,000 pound creature who is in rut.": 1,
    " out.": 1,
    " If you've ever seen a 2,000-pound camel in rut, it is a scary, scary thing to behold.": 1,
    "And if Richard thought I was getting in the ring with that camel, someone was smoking Bedouin High Grade.": 1,
    " So we got as close to it as possible, and I'm going to share this, Chris, if you want to roll this film, and then I'm going to show you a little bit more about the design of camels.": 1,
    "You want to roll the film?": 1,
    " Hello, this is Steve Jarosz with the TAD National Geographic Capital Investigation Unit, here to look at the Ultimate Geyser Machine.": 1,
    " You'll note I started chewing gum because I was around this camel.": 1,
    "That's it, that's it, okay.": 1,
    "No!": 1,
    "See now, he's getting a little over excited so we want to be very careful around him.": 1,
    "Don't let him get you.": 1,
    " What's up?": 1,
    " Now you can see": 1,
    " Kobe's mouth is a lot in there.": 1,
    "I always call myself the unstable, stable boy.": 1,
    "You can see his nose is flared right now.": 1,
    "When they're at that rep...": 1,
    " They're similar to seals in the way they, like a seal has to open its nose to breathe.": 1,
    "And they're similar.": 1,
    "They have to kind of consciously open their nose.": 1,
    "Ears.": 1,
    " But they are small, they have actual deer, but not a big, you know, for instance, zebras, they were huge.": 1,
    " ears that are very mobile so they can actually turn them both around.": 1,
    "And they use them the same as we use our binocular vision.": 1,
    "They use that to pinpoint sounds.": 1,
    " before they go very extremely windy as well as being very cold.": 1,
    "So not only do they have the, you know, the eyes, the very long eyelashes, but there's secondary": 1,
    " Most people think that the humps are a sort of water.": 1,
    "They dump, they store fat.": 1,
    " and I'm not a chemist but basically what happens is the fat": 1,
    " oxidized by the breathing and we'll turn it into actually": 1,
    " usable water like a lot of predators they walk on their toes but there's a big fat hat in there that squishes out and they're like snowshoes": 1,
    " singing.": 1,
    " Hubs.": 1,
    "They don't have traditional hubs, but they do have one like this now.": 1,
    "You can't really see it.": 1,
    " They use their tails a lot, especially him in rut.": 1,
    "He would urinate and spin his tails to spread the urine around and make him more active.": 1,
    " It works for them, so what the hell.": 1,
    "Well, they all work in certain areas.": 1,
    "Generally, it's not good work in one tree, but during a broad day.": 1,
    " I don't know if you've read or heard about, you know, the sub-sonic sounds from elephants.": 1,
    "You know, like the big rumbling sound.": 1,
    " He will do the same thing, and you can actually see right here, it will vibrate.": 1,
    "We weigh our animals.": 1,
    "Unfortunately, he's less very aggressive.": 1,
    " I'm guessing that he, well he's at least 1,600 pounds right, put him closer to 2,000.": 1,
    " He's basically a walking mulch pile.": 1,
    "We're kind of like Bud, but I'm also a male as well.": 1,
    "Yeah, exactly.": 1,
    "And it makes them very dangerous at this time of year.": 1,
    "Don't even think about it.": 1,
    " don't think about that but now we're gonna we're gonna leave": 1,
    " What I didn't show you was you got that swinging thing going.": 1,
    "Well, and you're glad I didn't show you this.": 1,
    "One of the other things about the camel that's beautifully designed is that its penis points backwards.": 1,
    " the camel can dip its tail in the stream and just lacquer the entire area around him.": 1,
    "And that's how he really marks his territory.": 1,
    " Now, what you also didn't see was that, and you may have noticed in the pen beside him, and by the way the camel's name is Suki, in the pen beside him is Jasmine.": 1,
    " Jasmine has been his mate for some time, but on this particular occasion, it was very, very clear that as horny as Suki was, Jasmine was having none of it.": 1,
    "And so we started thinking, well,": 1,
    " If poor old Suki's in search of a mate, what would Suki do to find the perfect mate?": 1,
    "So I'm going to show you another film, but before I do, I just want to mention that": 1,
    " This animal truly is the SUV of the sand, the ship of the desert.": 1,
    "It's so vital to": 1,
    " to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found, largely Mongolia and Sahara, that there are 160 words in Arabic to describe the camel.": 1,
    " And if this is a creature that was designed by committee, it's certainly been like no committee I've ever been on.": 1,
    "So here's what Suki would do in search of a mate.": 1,
    "Can you roll it, please?": 1,
    " I need you, my heart's on fire": 1,
    " You have time to me": 1,
    " Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams": 1,
    " I just want to leave you with one last thought, which is probably the most important thing to take away.": 1,
    "Humans, the animal.": 1,
    " are pretty lucky creatures because by and large we really don't have to adapt to our environment.": 1,
    "We adapt our environment to us and we've seen that repeatedly through this conference not just this year but in past years.": 1,
    " But this creature that you've just seen": 1,
    " ultimately adapts and keeps adapting and adapting.": 1,
    "And I think when you look at the animal kingdom, that is one of the most remarkable things.": 1,
    "It doesn't have an environment that adapts to it.": 1,
    "It has to adapt to the environment.": 1,
    "Ricky, thank you very much for having me.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
