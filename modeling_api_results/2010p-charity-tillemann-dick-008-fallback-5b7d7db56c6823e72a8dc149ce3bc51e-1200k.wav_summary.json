    " Thank you.": 5,
    " I...": 2,
    " You may not know this, but you are celebrating an anniversary with me.": 1,
    "I'm not married.": 1,
    "But one year ago today, I woke up from a month-long coma.": 1,
    " following a double lung transplant.": 1,
    " Crazy.": 1,
    "I know.": 1,
    "Insane.": 1,
    "Six years before that, I was starting my career as an opera singer in Europe when I was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, also known as PH.": 1,
    " It happens when there's a thickening in the pulmonary veins, making the right side of the heart work overtime and causing what I call the reverse Grinch effect.": 1,
    " My heart was three and a half sizes too big.": 1,
    "Physical activity becomes very difficult for people with this condition, and usually after two to five years, you die.": 1,
    " I went to see this specialist and she was top of the field and told me I had to stop singing.": 1,
    "She said those high notes are going to kill you.": 1,
    " While she didn't have any medical evidence to back up her claim that there was a relationship between operatic arias and pulmonary hypertension, she was absolutely emphatic.": 1,
    "I was singing my own obituary.": 1,
    " I was very limited by my condition physically.": 1,
    "But I was not limited when I sang.": 1,
    "And as air came up from my lungs through my vocal cords and passed my lips as sound, it was the closest thing I": 1,
    " had ever come to transcendence.": 1,
    "And just because of someone's hunch, I wasn't going to give it up.": 1,
    " Thankfully, I met Reda Gerges, who is dry as toast, but he and his team at Johns Hopkins didn't just want me to survive.": 1,
    "They wanted me to live a meaningful life.": 1,
    " This meant making trade-offs.": 1,
    " I come from Colorado.": 1,
    "It's a mile high and I grew up there with my ten brothers and sisters and two adoring parents.": 1,
    "Well, the altitude exacerbated my symptoms.": 1,
    " So I moved to Baltimore to be near my doctor's and enrolled in conservatory nearby.": 1,
    " I couldn't walk as much as I used to, so I opted for five-inch heels, and I gave up salt, I went vegan, and I started taking huge doses of": 1,
    " also known as Viagra.": 1,
    " My father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing, an alternative or traditional therapies for pH, but after six months,": 1,
    " I couldn't walk up a small hill.": 1,
    "I couldn't climb a flight of stairs.": 1,
    "I could barely stand up without feeling like I was going to faint.": 1,
    " I had a heart catheterization where they measured this internal arterial pulmonary pressure, which is supposed to be between 15 and 20.": 1,
    "Mine was 146.": 1,
    "I like to do things big.": 1,
    " And it meant one thing.": 1,
    "There is a big gun treatment for pulmonary hypertension called Flolan.": 1,
    "And it's not just a drug, it's a way of life.": 1,
    "Doctors insert a catheter in your chest.": 1,
    " which is attached to a pump that weighs about four and a half pounds.": 1,
    " Every day, 24 hours, that pump is at your side, administering medicine directly to your heart.": 1,
    " It's not a particularly preferable medicine in many senses.": 1,
    "This is a list of the side effects.": 1,
    " If you eat too much salt, like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you'll probably end up in the ICU.": 1,
    "If you go through a metal detector, you'll probably die.": 1,
    " If you get a bubble in your medicine because you have to mix it every morning and it stays in there, you probably die.": 1,
    "If you run out of medicine, you definitely die.": 1,
    "No one wants to go on Floen.": 1,
    " But when I needed it, it was a godsend.": 1,
    "Within a few days, I could walk again.": 1,
    "Within a few weeks, I was performing.": 1,
    "And in a few months,": 1,
    " I debuted at the Kennedy Center.": 1,
    " was a little bit problematic when performing.": 1,
    "So I'd attach it to my inner thigh with the help of a girdle and an ace bandage.": 1,
    " Literally hundreds of elevator rides were spent with me alone, stuffing the pump into my spanks, hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly.": 1,
    " And the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume designers.": 1,
    " I graduated from graduate school in 2006, and I got a fellowship to go back to Europe.": 1,
    " wonderful old conductor who started casting me in all of these roles, and before long I was commuting between Budapest, Milan, and Florence, though I was attached to this ugly unwanted high maintenance mechanical pet.": 1,
    " My life is kind of like the happy part in an opera.": 1,
    "Very complicated, but in a good way.": 1,
    " Then in February of 2008, my grandfather passed away.": 1,
    "He was a big figure in all of our lives, and we loved him very much.": 1,
    " It certainly didn't prepare me for what came next.": 1,
    "Seven weeks later, I got a call from my family.": 1,
    " My father had been in a catastrophic car accident and he died.": 1,
    " At 24, my death would have been entirely expected, but his, well, the only way I can articulate": 1,
    " How it felt was that it precipitated my medical decline.": 1,
    "Against my doctor's and family's wishes, I needed to go back for the funeral.": 1,
    "I had to say goodbye in some way, shape, or form.": 1,
    " But soon I was showing signs of right heart failure, and I had to return to C level, doing so knowing that I probably would never see my home again.": 1,
    " I had canceled most of my engagements that summer, but I had one left in Tel Aviv, so I went.": 1,
    " After one performance, I could barely drag myself from the stage to the taxi cab.": 1,
    "I sat down and felt the blood rush down from my face.": 1,
    " In the heat of the desert, I was freezing cold.": 1,
    "My fingers started turning blue, and I was like, what is going on?": 1,
    " On here, I heard my heart's valves snapping open and closed.": 1,
    "The cab stopped and I pulled my body from it, feeling each ounce of weight as I walked to the elevator.": 1,
    "I fell through my apartment door.": 1,
    " and crawled to the bathroom.": 1,
    "Where I found my problem, I had forgotten to mix in the most important part of my medicine.": 1,
    "I was dying.": 1,
    "And if I didn't mix that stuff up fast,": 1,
    " I would never leave that apartment alive.": 1,
    " I started mixing, and I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another.": 1,
    "But I just kept on going.": 1,
    "Finally, with the last bottle in and the last bubble out, I attached the pump to the tubing and lay there, hoping it would kick in.": 1,
    " soon enough.": 1,
    "If it didn't, I'd probably see my father sooner than I anticipated.": 1,
    " Thankfully, in a few minutes, I saw the signature hive-like rash appear on my legs, which is a side effect of the medication, and I knew I'd be okay.": 1,
    "We're not big on fear in my family.": 1,
    " But I was scared.": 1,
    "I went back to the States, anticipating I'd return to Europe.": 1,
    "But a heart catheterization showed that I wasn't going anywhere further than a flight for life from Johns Hopkins Hospital.": 1,
    "I performed here and there.": 1,
    " But as my condition deteriorated, so did my voice.": 1,
    " My doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant.": 1,
    "I didn't.": 1,
    "I had two friends who had recently died.": 1,
    " months after having very challenging surgeries.": 1,
    "I knew another young man, though, who had pH, who died while waiting for one.": 1,
    " I wanted to live.": 1,
    "I thought stem cells were a good option, but they hadn't developed to a point where I could take advantage of them yet.": 1,
    " I officially took a break from singing and I went to the Cleveland Clinic to be reevaluated for the third time in five years for transplant.": 1,
    "I was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking with the head transplant surgeon.": 1,
    " And I asked him if I needed to transplant, what I could do to prepare.": 1,
    "He said, be happy.": 1,
    "A happy patient is a healthy patient.": 1,
    " It was like in one verbal swoop.": 1,
    "He had channeled my thoughts on life and medicine and Confucius.": 1,
    "I still didn't want a transplant, but in a month,": 1,
    " I was back in the hospital with some severely edemic cankles, very attractive, and it was right heart failure.": 1,
    " finally decided it was time to take my doctor's advice.": 1,
    " It was time for me to go to Cleveland and to start the agonizing wait for a match.": 1,
    " But the next morning, while I was still in the hospital, I got a telephone call.": 1,
    "It was my doctor in Cleveland, Marie Boudev.": 1,
    " And they had lungs.": 1,
    "It was a match.": 1,
    "They were from Texas.": 1,
    "And everybody was really happy for me.": 1,
    " But me, because despite their problems, I spent my whole life training my lungs, and I was not particularly enthusiastic about giving them up.": 1,
    " flew to Cleveland and my family rushed there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye.": 1,
    " But organs don't wait.": 1,
    "And I went into surgery before.": 1,
    " I could say goodbye.": 1,
    "The last thing I remember was lying on a white blanket telling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again and to please try and save my voice.": 1,
    " I fell into this apocalyptic dream world.": 1,
    "During the 13 and a half hour surgery, I flatlined twice.": 1,
    " 40 quarts of blood were infused into my body.": 1,
    "And in my surgeon's 20-year career, he said it was among the most difficult transplants that he's ever performed.": 1,
    " They left my chest open for two weeks.": 1,
    "You could see my oversized heart beating inside of it.": 1,
    "I was on a dozen machines that were keeping me alive, and infection ravaged my skin.": 1,
    " had hoped my voice would be saved, but my doctors knew that the breathing tubes going down my throat might have already destroyed it.": 1,
    " If they stayed in, there was no way I would ever sing again.": 1,
    "So my doctor got the ENT, the top guy at the clinic, to come down and give me a surgery to move the tubes around my voice box.": 1,
    " He said it would kill me, so my own surgeon performed the procedure in a last-ditch attempt to save my voice.": 1,
    "Though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me before the surgery,": 1,
    " She didn't leave my side in the months of recovery that followed.": 1,
    "And if you want an example of perseverance, grit, and strength in a beautiful little package,": 1,
    " It is her.": 1,
    " one year ago to this very day.": 1,
    " I woke up.": 1,
    " I was 95 pounds.": 1,
    "There were a dozen tubes coming in and out of my body.": 1,
    "I couldn't walk.": 1,
    "I couldn't talk.": 1,
    "I couldn't eat.": 1,
    "I couldn't move.": 1,
    "I certainly couldn't sing.": 1,
    "I couldn't even breathe.": 1,
    " But when I looked up...": 1,
    " and I saw my mother.": 1,
    " I couldn't help but smile.": 1,
    " Whether by a Mack truck or by heart failure or faulty lungs, death happens.": 1,
    " But life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it?": 1,
    "It's about living.": 1,
    "Medical conditions don't negate the human condition.": 1,
    " When people are allowed to pursue their passions, doctors will find they have better, happier, and healthier patients.": 1,
    " totally stressed out about me going and auditioning and traveling and performing all over the place.": 1,
    "But they knew that it was much better for me to do that than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time.": 1,
    " And I'm so grateful he did.": 1,
    "This past summer, when I was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother in the Colorado Rockies, I couldn't help but think of that doctor.": 1,
    " who told me that I couldn't sing.": 1,
    " And I wanted to tell her, and I want to tell you, we need to stop letting disease divorce us from our dreams.": 1,
    "When we do,": 1,
    " we will find that patients don't just survive, we thrive.": 1,
    " and some of us might even sing.": 1,
    " Je veux vivre dans ce r\u00eave qui m'a livr\u00e9 ce jour encore tout seul.": 1,
    " foreign": 1,
    " me.": 1,
    " Oh,": 1,
    " Oh!": 1,
    " Le c'est moi s'ennuyer et respirer la rose, respirer la rose avant de la feuillette.": 1,
    " Oh": 1,
    " Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.": 1,
    "And I'd like to thank my pianist Monica Lee.": 1,
    " Thank you so much.": 1
