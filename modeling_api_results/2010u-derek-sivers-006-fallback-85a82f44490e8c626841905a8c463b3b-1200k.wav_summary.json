    " So ladies and gentlemen, at TED we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement.": 1,
    "So let's watch a movement happen, start to finish in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it.": 1,
    "First, of course you know, a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed.": 1,
    " But what he's doing is so easy to follow.": 1,
    "So here's his first follower with a crucial role.": 1,
    "He's going to show everyone else how to follow.": 1,
    " Now notice that the leader embraces him as an equal.": 1,
    "So now it's not about the leader anymore, it's about them, plural.": 1,
    "Now there he is calling to his friends.": 1,
    "Now if you notice that the first follower is actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself.": 1,
    " It takes guts to stand out like that.": 1,
    "The first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader.": 1,
    " And here comes a second follower.": 1,
    "Now it's not a lone nut, it's not two nuts, three is a crowd, and the crowd is news.": 1,
    "So a movement must be public.": 1,
    " It's important to show not just the leader, but the followers, because you find that new followers emulate the followers, not the leader.": 1,
    " Now here come two more people and immediately after three more people.": 1,
    "Now we've got momentum.": 1,
    "This is the tipping point.": 1,
    "Now we've got a movement.": 1,
    " Notice that as more people join in, it's less risky.": 1,
    "So those that were sitting on the fence before now have no reason not to.": 1,
    "They won't stand out, they won't be ridiculed, but they will be part of the in-crowd if they hurry.": 1,
    " Over the next minute, you'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd, because eventually they would be ridiculed for not joining in.": 1,
    "And that's how you make a movement.": 1,
    "But let's recap some lessons from this.": 1,
    " So first, if you are the type, like the shirtless dancing guy, that is standing alone, remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals.": 1,
    "So it's clearly about the movement, not you.": 1,
    " Okay, but we might have missed the real lesson here.": 1,
    "The biggest lesson, if you noticed, did you catch it?": 1,
    "Is that leadership is over glorified.": 1,
    " that yes, it was the shirtless guy was first and he'll get all the credit, but it was really the first follower that transformed the lone nut into a leader.": 1,
    "So as we're told that we should all be leaders, that would be really ineffective.": 1,
    " If you really care about starting a movement, have the courage to follow and show others how to follow.": 1,
    "And when you find a lone nut doing something great, have the guts to be the first one to stand up and join in.": 1,
    "And what a perfect place to do that, Ted.": 1,
    " Thanks.": 1
