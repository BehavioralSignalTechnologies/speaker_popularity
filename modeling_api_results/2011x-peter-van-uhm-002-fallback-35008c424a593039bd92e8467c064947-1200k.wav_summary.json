    " As the highest military commander of the Netherlands with troops stationed around the world, I'm really honored to be here today.": 1,
    " When I look around this TEDx Amsterdam venue, I see a very special audience.": 1,
    " You are the reason why I said yes to the invitation to come here today.": 1,
    " When I look around I see people who want to make a contribution.": 1,

    " by doing ground-breaking scientific work.": 1,
    " by creating impressive works of art.": 1,
    " by writing critical articles or inspiring books, by starting up sustainable businesses.": 1,
    " And you all have chosen your own instruments to fulfill this mission of creating a better world.": 1,
    " Some chose the microscope as their instrument.": 1,
    "Others chose dancing or painting or making music like we just heard.": 1,
    "Some chose the pen.": 1,
    " Others work through the instrument of money.": 1,
    " Ladies and gentlemen, I made a different choice.": 1,
    " Ladies and gentlemen.": 1,
    " I share your goals.": 1,
    " I share the goals of the speakers you heard before.": 1,
    " I did not.": 1,
    " choose to take up the pen.": 1,
    " the brush.": 1,
    " the camera.": 1,
    " I chose this instrument.": 1,
    "I chose the gun.": 1,
    " For you, and you heard already, being so close to this can may make you feel uneasy.": 1,
    " It may even feel scary.": 1,
    " a real gun at a few feet distance.": 1,
    " Let us stop for a moment and feel this uneasiness.": 1,
    "You could even hear it.": 1,
    " Let us cherish the fact that probably most of you": 1,
    " have never been close to a gun.": 1,
    " It means the Netherlands is a peaceful country.": 1,
    "The Netherlands is not at war.": 1,
    "It means soldiers are not needed to patrol our streets.": 1,
    " Guns are not a part of our lives.": 1,
    " In many countries, it is a different story.": 1,
    " In many countries, people are confronted with guns.": 1,
    "They are oppressed.": 1,
    "They are intimidated.": 1,
    " by warlords.": 1,
    " by terrorists, by criminals.": 1,
    " Weapons can do a lot of harm.": 1,
    " They are the cause of much distress.": 1,
    "Why then am I standing before you with this weapon?": 1,
    " Why did I choose the gun as my instrument?": 1,
    " Today I want to tell you why.": 1,
    "Today I want to tell you why I chose the gun to create a better world.": 1,
    "And I want to tell you how this gun can help.": 1,
    " My story starts...": 1,
    " in the city of Nijmegen.": 1,
    " in the east of the Netherlands.": 1,
    " the city where I was born.": 1,
    " My father was a hard-working baker.": 1,
    " But when he had finished work in the bakery, he often told me and my brother stories.": 1,
    " And most of the time, he told me this story I'm going to share with you now.": 1,
    " The story of what happened when he was a conscript soldier in the Dutch armed forces at the beginning of the Second World War.": 1,
    " The Nazis invaded the Netherlands.": 1,
    "Their grim plans were evident.": 1,
    "They meant to rule by means of repression.": 1,
    " diplomacy had failed to stop the Germans.": 1,
    " Only brute force remained.": 1,
    "It was our last resort.": 1,
    " My father was there to provide it.": 1,
    " As the son of a farmer who knew how to hunt, my father was an excellent marksman.": 1,
    "When he aimed, he never missed.": 1,
    " At this decisive moment in Dutch history, my father was positioned on the bank of the river Waal, near the city of Nijmegen.": 1,
    " He had a clear shot at the German soldiers who came to occupy a free country.": 1,
    "His country.": 1,
    "Our country.": 1,
    " He fired.": 1,
    "Nothing happened.": 1,
    "He fired again.": 1,
    "No German soldier fell to the ground.": 1,
    " My father had been given an old gun that could not even reach the opposite riverbank.": 1,
    " Hitler's troops marched on and there was nothing my father could do about it.": 1,
    " Until the day my father died, he was frustrated about missing these shots.": 1,
    " He could have done something.": 1,
    " With an old gun, not even the best marksmen in the armed forces could have hit the mark.": 1,
    " So this story stays with me.": 1,
    " Then in high school, I was gripped by the stories of the Allied soldiers.": 1,
    " soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives to liberate a country": 1,
    " and the people that they didn't know.": 1,
    "They liberated my birth town.": 1,
    " It was then that I decided I would take up the gun.": 1,
    " out of respect and gratitude for those men and women who came to liberate us.": 1,
    " from the awareness that sometimes only the gun": 1,
    " can stand between good and evil.": 1,
    " And that is why I took up the gun.": 1,
    "Not to shoot.": 1,
    " not to kill, not to destroy.": 1,
    " but to stop those who would do evil.": 1,
    " to protect the vulnerable.": 1,
    " to defend democratic values.": 1,
    " to stand up for the freedom we have to talk here today in Amsterdam about how we can make the world a better place.": 1,
    " Ladies and gentlemen, I do not stand here today to tell you about the glory of weapons.": 1,
    " I do not like guns.": 1,
    " And once you have been under fire yourself.": 1,
    " It brings home even more clearly that a gun is not some macho instrument to brag about.": 1,
    " I stand here today to tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability.": 1,
    " The gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world.": 1,
    " Now this may sound contradictory to you.": 1,
    " But not only have I seen with my own eyes during my deployments in the Lebanon, Sarajevo and as the Netherlands Chief of Defense, this is also supported by cold,": 1,
    " Hard statistics.": 1,
    " Violence has declined dramatically over the last 500 years.": 1,
    " Despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news, wars between developed countries are no longer commonplace.": 1,
    "The murder rate in Europe has dropped by a factor of 30.": 1,
    " since the Middle Ages.": 1,
    "And occurrences of civil war and repression have declined since the end of the Cold War.": 1,
    " Statistics show that we are living in a relatively peaceful era.": 1,
    "Why?": 1,
    "Why has violence decreased?": 1,
    " Has the human mind changed?": 1,
    "Well, we were talking on the human mind this morning.": 1,
    "Did we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge, for violent rituals, for pure race?": 1,
    " Or is there something else?": 1,
    " In his latest book, Harvard Professor Steven Pinker and many other thinkers before him,": 1,
    " concludes that one of the main drivers behind less violent societies is the spread of the constitutional state.": 1,
    " and introduction on a large scale of the state monopoly on the legitimized use of violence.": 1,
    " legitimized by a democratically elected government.": 1,
    " legitimized by checks and balances and an independent judicial system.": 1,
    "In other words, a state monopoly that has the use of violence well under control.": 1,
    " Such a state monopoly on violence, first of all, serves as a reassurance.": 1,
    " It removes the incentive for an arms race between potentially hostile groups in our societies.": 1,
    " Secondly, the presence of penalties that outweigh the benefits of using violence tips the balance even further.": 1,
    " Abstaining from violence becomes more profitable than starting a war.": 1,
    " Now non-finance starts to work like a flywheel.": 1,
    " It enhances peace even further.": 1,
    " Where there is no conflict, trade flourish.": 1,
    " And trade is another important incentive against violence.": 1,
    " With trade, there's mutual interdependency and mutual gain between parties.": 1,
    " And when there was mutual gain, both sides stand to lose more than they would gain if they started a war.": 1,
    " War is simply no longer the best option.": 1,
    "And that is why violence has decreased.": 1,
    " This, ladies and gentlemen, is the rationale behind the existence of my armed forces.": 1,
    " the armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence.": 1,
    "We do this in a legitimized way only after our democracy has asked us": 1,
    " to do so.": 1,
    " It is this legitimate, controlled use of the gun that has contributed greatly to reducing the statistics of war, conflict and violence around the globe.": 1,
    " It is this participation in peacekeeping missions that has led to the resolution of many civil wars.": 1,
    "My soldiers used a gun as an instrument of peace.": 1,
    " And this is exactly why failed states are so dangerous.": 1,
    " Failed states have no legitimized, democratically controlled use of force.": 1,
    "Failed states do not know of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability.": 1,
    " That is why failed states can drag down a whole region into chaos and conflict.": 1,
    " That is why spreading the concept of the constitutional state is such an important aspect of our foreign missions.": 1,
    " That is why we are trying to build a judicial system right now in Afghanistan.": 1,
    " That is why we train police officers, we train judges, we train public prosecutors around the world.": 1,
    " And that is why, and in the Netherlands we are very unique in that, that is why the Dutch Constitution states": 1,
    " that one of the main tasks of the armed forces is to uphold and promote the international rule of law.": 1,
    " Ladies and gentlemen, looking at this gun, we are confronted with the ugly side of the human mind.": 1,
    " Every day I hope that politicians, diplomats, development workers can turn conflict into peace and threat into hope.": 1,
    " And I hope that one day armies can be disbanded and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression.": 1,
    " But until that day comes, we will have to make ideals and human failure meet somewhere in the middle.": 1,
    "Until that day comes,": 1,
    " I stand for my father, who tried to shoot the Nazis with an old gun.": 1,
    "I stand for my men and women.": 1,
    " who are prepared to risk their lives for a less violent world for all of us.": 1,
    " I stand for this soldier who suffered partial hearing loss and sustained permanent injuries to her leg when she was hit by a rocket on her mission in Afghanistan.": 1,
    " Ladies and gentlemen, until the day comes when we can do away with the gun, I hope we all agree that peace and stability do not come free of charge.": 1,
    " It takes hard work, often behind the scenes.": 1,
    " It takes good equipment and well-trained, dedicated soldiers.": 1,
    " I hope you will support the efforts of our armed forces to train soldiers like this young captain and provide her with a good gun instead of the bad gun my father was given.": 1,
    " I hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there.": 1,
    " when they come home.": 1,
    " and when they are injured and need our care.": 1,
    "They put their lives on the line for us, for you, and we cannot let them down.": 1,
    " I hope you will respect my soldiers, this soldier, with this gun.": 1,
    "Because she wants a better world.": 1,
    "Because she makes an active contribution to that better world.": 1,
    " just like all of us here today.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
