    " Five years ago, I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland.": 1,
    "Penn State asked me, a communications teacher, to teach a communications class for engineering students.": 1,
    " And I was scared, really scared, scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big unfamiliar words.": 1,
    "But as these conversations unfolded,": 1,
    " I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world.": 1,
    " how I felt as I had those conversations with the students.": 1,
    "I was amazed at the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well.": 1,
    "And I believe the key to opening that door is great communication.": 1,
    " We desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.": 1,
    "Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges from energy to environment to healthcare among others.": 1,
    " And if we don't know about it and understand it, then the work isn't done.": 1,
    "And I believe it's our responsibility as non-scientists to have these interactions.": 1,
    " But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland.": 1,
    "So scientists and engineers, please talk nerdy to us.": 1,
    " I wanna share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy.": 1,
    " and that your engineering is engaging.": 1,
    "First question to answer for us, so what?": 1,
    "Tell us why your science is relevant to us.": 1,
    "Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae.": 1,
    " But tell me that you study trabeculae, which is the mesh-like structure of our bones, because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis.": 1,
    " And when you're describing your science, beware of jargon.": 1,
    "Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas.": 1,
    "Sure, you can say spatial and temporal, but why not just say space and time, which is so much more accessible to us?": 1,
    " And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down.": 1,
    "Instead, as Einstein said, make everything as simple as possible, but no simpler.": 1,
    " You can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas.": 1,
    "A few things to consider are having examples, stories, and analogies.": 1,
    "Those are ways to engage and excite us about your content.": 1,
    " And when presenting your work, drop the bullet points.": 1,
    "Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet points?": 1,
    " What do bullets do?": 1,
    "Bullets kill, and they will kill your presentation.": 1,
    "A slide like this is not only boring, but it relies too much on the language area of our brain and causes us to become overwhelmed.": 1,
    " Instead, this example slide by Genevieve Brown is much more effective.": 1,
    "It's showing that the special structure of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.": 1,
    " And the trick here is to use a single readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost.": 1,
    "And then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what's being described.": 1,
    " So I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering.": 1,
    " And because the engineers that I've worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd, I want to summarize with an equation.": 1,
    " Take your science, subtract your bullet points and your jargon, divide by relevance, meaning share what's relevant to the audience,": 1,
    " and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you're doing.": 1,
    "And that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding.": 1,
    "And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation,": 1,
    " By all means, talk nerdy to me.": 1
