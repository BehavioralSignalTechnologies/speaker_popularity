    " I started on a journey 30 years ago and I worked in mines and I realized that this was a world unseen and I wanted through color and large format cameras and very large prints to make a body of work that somehow became symbols": 1,
    " of our use of the landscape, how we use the land.": 1,
    "And to me this was a key component that somehow through this medium of photography, which allows us to contemplate these landscapes,": 1,
    " that I thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work.": 1,
    "And after 17 years of photographing large industrial landscapes, it occurred to me that oil was underpinning the scale and speed, because that's what's changed.": 1,
    " It's a speed at which we're taking all our resources.": 1,
    "And so then I went out to develop a whole series on the landscape of oil.": 1,
    " What I want to do is kind of map an arc that there's extraction where we're taking it from the ground, refinement, and that's one chapter.": 1,
    "The other chapter that I wanted to look at was how we use it, our cities, our cars, our motor cultures, where": 1,
    " people gather around the vehicle as a celebration.": 1,
    "And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil, this entropic end where all of our parts of cars, our tires,": 1,
    " oil filters, helicopters, planes, where are the landscapes where all that stuff ends up?": 1,
    "And to me, again, photography was a way in which I can explore and research the world and find those places.": 1,
    " And another idea that I had as well that was brought forward by an ecologist, and he basically did a calculation where he took one litre of gas and said, well, how much carbon it would take and how much": 1,
    " Organic material it was 23 metric tons for one liter So whenever I fill up my gas with I think of that leader and how much?": 1,
    "Carbon and I know that oil comes from the ocean and final factor, but he did the did the calculations": 1,
    " for our earth and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy.": 1,
    "From the photosynthetic growth, it would take 500 years of that growth to produce what we use, the 30 billion barrels we use per year.": 1,
    " And that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society, looking at...": 1,
    " 30 billion per year we look at our two largest suppliers Saudi Arabia now Canada with its dirty oil and together they only form about 15 years of supply the whole world of 1.2 trillion": 1,
    " estimated reserves only gives us about 45 years.": 1,
    "So it's not a question of if, but a question of when peak oil will come upon us.": 1,
    " So to me, using photography, and I feel that all of us need to now begin to really take the task of using our talents": 1,
    " our ways of thinking to begin to deal with what I think is probably one of the most challenging issues of our time, how to deal with our energy crisis.": 1,
    " And I would like to say that on the other side, 34 years from now, the children that I have, I can look at them and say, we did everything we possibly humanly could do to begin to mitigate this.": 1,
    " what I feel is one of the most important and critical moments in our time.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
