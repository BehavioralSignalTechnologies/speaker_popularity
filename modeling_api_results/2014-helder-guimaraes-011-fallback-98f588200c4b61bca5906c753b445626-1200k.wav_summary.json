    "Yes.": 4,

    "Indeed.": 2,
    " Seven.": 2,
    " I'd like to start my performance by saying 90% of everything is crap.": 1,
    "It's called the Sturgeon's Law and what that means is that the majority of anything is always bad.": 1,
    " I have a giraffe here.": 1,
    "I'm going to throw the giraffe behind my back.": 1,
    "Whoever caught it is going to help me on this next thing.": 1,
    " Sir, you got the giraffe.": 1,
    "I have a playing card in my hand.": 1,
    " freely name any card in the deck.": 1,
    " Ten of hearts.": 1,
    "Ten of hearts.": 1,
    "You could have named any card in the deck, but you said the ten of hearts.": 1,
    "Ninety percent of everything is crap.": 1,
    "So is this to prove that Sturgeon was correct?": 1,
    " So...": 1,
    " Sir, this is not your show.": 1,
    " Keep the giraffe for a moment, okay?": 1,
    " Jesus.": 1,
    " Crazy people.": 1,
    "Well, the truth is, why is the majority of everything bad?": 1,
    "And my answer is, I think we stop thinking too soon.": 1,
    " I'll give you a clear example, something that people used to do around the turn of the century.": 1,
    "This, not this century, the other one.": 1,
    "The idea was to take a piece of paper and fold it inside out.": 1,
    " using only your weaker hand, in my case, the left hand, something that would look like this.": 1,
    " By the way you reacted, I can see your lack of interest.": 1,
    " But that's okay, I understand why.": 1,
    "We stop thinking too soon.": 1,
    "But we should give it a little bit more thought, like a paperclip.": 1,
    "A paperclip makes this": 1,
    " a little bit more interesting.": 1,
    "Not only that, if instead of using my hand with the fingers, I use my hand close into a fist, that makes this even a little bit more interesting.": 1,
    "Not only that, I will impose myself a time limit": 1,
    " of one second something that would look like": 1,
    " this.": 1,
    " Now, Sturgeon may be correct, but it doesn't have to be correct forever.": 1,
    "Things can always change.": 1,
    "Sir, what was the card?": 1,
    "The 10 of hearts?": 1,
    " serves this to prove that things can always change the ten of hearts.": 1,
    " Secrets are important.": 1,
    " And secrets are valuable.": 1,
    "And this is the best secret I've ever experienced.": 1,
    "It starts with a deck of cards onto the table, an old man and a claim.": 1,
    " I will not touch the deck till the end.": 1,
    "It doesn't matter who the man was.": 1,
    "All that mattered was that sentence ringing in my head.": 1,
    " I will not touch the deck until the end.": 1,
    "Now, during all this time, you were holding a small notebook that sometimes you would open and flip through the pages and look at something, but I was not really paying attention": 1,
    " To the book because I was paying attention to the deck and the claim he had made before I will not touch the deck till the end now so you have the draft go ahead throw it in any direction so that you can find someone else at random.": 1,
    " Perfect.": 1,
    "Sir, you're going to play my role in this story.": 1,
    "The old man turned to me and he said, you could pick a red card or a black card.": 1,
    "And my answer was... A black card.": 1,
    "It was a black card.": 1,
    " He said it could be a club or a spade.": 1,
    "And my answer was spade.": 1,
    " Indeed, it was a spade.": 1,
    "He said it could be a high spade or a low spade.": 1,
    "And my answer was a high spade.": 1,
    " Indeed!": 1,
    "It was a high spade.": 1,
    "Since it's a high spade, it can be a nine, a ten, a jack, queen, king, or the ace of spades.": 1,
    "And my answer was... The king.": 1,
    "The king of spades.": 1,
    " Now sir, let's be fair, you selected Black, you selected Spade, you selected the Ice Spade, and you selected, sorry, King of Spades.": 1,
    "Did you feel an influencer in any decision?": 1,
    "No, I just felt your energy.": 1,
    " But it was a free choice, correct?": 1,
    "Oh, absolutely.": 1,
    "Because if not, we could start all over again, but it was really fair.": 1,
    "Yeah, absolutely.": 1,
    "Now, the old man turned to me and he asked me one more question, a number between 1 and 52.": 1,
    " And the first number I thought of was 17.": 1,
    "Indeed!": 1,
    "It was the 17.": 1,
    "The old man only said one more thing.": 1,
    " This is the end.": 1,
    "And I knew exactly what that meant.": 1,
    "I knew you was going to touch the deck.": 1,
    " Everything that you are about to see is exactly as it looked.": 1,
    "It took the deck out of the box.": 1,
    "Nothing in the box.": 1,
    " He counted 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.": 1,
    "The tension was building.": 1,
    " 17.": 1,
    " And on the 17th, instead of the King of Spades, something appeared in the middle of the deck that later I would realize was actually a secret.": 1,
    " The old man stood up.": 1,
    "He left.": 1,
    "I never saw him again.": 1,
    " But the last is Notebook.": 1,
    " That was there from the beginning.": 1,
    "And when I picked it up.": 1,
    " That was the best secret I've ever experienced.": 1,
    " We are the fine.": 1,
    " by the secrets we keep and by the secrets we share.": 1,
    "And this was his way of sharing a secret with me.": 1,
    " Crazy shit.": 1,
    "Now.": 1,
    " I believe.": 1,
    " That amazing things happen all the time.": 1,
    "I really do.": 1,
    "And the reason why we don't see them as often, it's because we don't place ourselves in a position to search for those amazing things.": 1,
    " But what if, what if we decided to search for those amazing things, for those small coincidences in life that are truly amazing?": 1,
    " Sir, you have the giraffe.": 1,
    "Go ahead, throw it again in any direction so you find one last person at random.": 1,
    " Sir, I'm going to ask you, do you have with you a United States one dollar bill?": 1,
    "I think so.": 1,
    "Yes, you see a coincidence.": 1,
    " Let's make sure you have it.": 1,
    "Do you have it?": 1,
    " Now, I want you to do exactly the same thing I'm about to do.": 1,
    "I have a dollar bill here to explain.": 1,
    "I want you to take the dollar bill and fold the Washington part inside like this.": 1,
    "So we'll get this kind of": 1,
    " Now, I want you to take the bill and fold it like this, lengthwise, so it becomes like a rectangle, and then again, when you have it, and really fold it, really crease it, and when you have it, please fold the bill again into a little square.": 1,
    " square like this and let me know when you have it.": 1,
    " Do you have it perfect now I'm going to approach.": 1,
    "And before we start I want to make sure that we do this in very very serious conditions first of all I want to sure that we have a marker and we have a paperclip.": 1,
    " First of all, take the marker and go ahead and sign the bill.": 1,
    "And this is the reason why.": 1,
    "Later, I'm going to be doing a bunch of stuff on stage.": 1,
    "And I don't want you to think, oh, while I was distracted by hell, there's someone came on stage.": 1,
    " and swap the bill.": 1,
    "So I'm going to make sure it's exactly the same deal.": 1,
    "Now, not only that, I want you to take the paper clip and put it around the bill.": 1,
    "So even if nobody comes on stage and switches the bill, I don't have enough time to go open the bill and close it and see what I don't want to see.": 1,
    " Is that fair?": 1,
    "Now you can give me the marker back.": 1,
    "And just like that, very clearly, I want to make sure that we're going to place this in full view from the beginning of this experience.": 1,
    " And to make sure that everyone is going to see it, we're going to actually have a cameraman on stage.": 1,
    "So that you can see that your signature.": 1,
    "Now we're going to use also.": 1,
    " the deck and a glass for this.": 1,
    "And we're going to put ourselves in a position": 1,
    " to search for an amazing coincidence.": 1,
    " You can shuffle cars in a variety of ways.": 1,
    "You can shuffle cars like this.": 1,
    "You can shuffle cars in a more messed up way, something like this.": 1,
    "You can shuffle cars in the American way.": 1,
    "As a Portuguese, I don't feel entitled to teach you guys how to do it.": 1,
    " But the important part is, after shopping the cards, always remember to cut and complete the cards.": 1,
    "Do you mind doing that for me, sir?": 1,
    "Please cut and complete.": 1,
    "And when you have it, place the cards up in the air.": 1,
    " And you too cut them complete up in the air, up in the air, up in the air, up in the air.": 1,
    "And deck of cards, cut it in shuffle by one, two, three, and four, and five people.": 1,
    "Now, very clearly, I'm going to gather the deck together.": 1,
    " And just like that.": 1,
    " I'm going to search for a coincidence.": 1,
    " in front of everyone.": 1,
    " I'm gonna try.": 1,
    " I have some cards.": 1,
    " that maybe, maybe they don't mean anything.": 1,
    " But maybe that's because we are not paying close attention.": 1,
    "Because maybe, maybe they mean a lot.": 1,
    "Before we start, sir, you gave me a dollar bill.": 1,
    "Is that your signature?": 1,
    " Yes it is.": 1,
    "Now I want you to see very clearly": 1,
    " But I'm going to open your bill and reveal a small secret": 1,
    " that we created and the secret of this dollar bill, it's the serial number.": 1,
    "Madam, can you take the dollar bill?": 1,
    " In the serial number, there is a letter.": 1,
    "What is the first number after the letter?": 1,
    " But that's maybe just one coincidence.": 1,
    "What is the second number?": 1,
    "So after the seven, we have a nine.": 1,
    " And after the nine, two, the two.": 1,
    "And after the two, three, three.": 1,
    "And after three, three, seven, seven, four, four, two.": 1,
    " Two and?": 1,
    "Q. Q like in Queen?": 1,
    "Uh huh.": 1,
    " The Queen of Clubs, all the cards in order, just for you.": 1,
    "And that's my show.": 1,
    "Thank you very much and have a nice night.": 1
