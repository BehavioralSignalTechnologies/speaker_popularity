    " All right, so I wanted to do something special today.": 1,
    "I want to debut a new song that I've been working on in the last five or six months.": 1,
    " And there's few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience, especially when it's half finished.": 1,
    " I'm kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms and": 1,
    " So this is basically a song about loops, but not the kind of loops that I make up here.": 1,
    "They're feedback loops.": 1,
    "And in the audio world, that's kind of, that's when the microphone gets too close to": 1,
    " its sound source and then it gets in this self-destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound.": 1,
    "I'm going to demonstrate for you.": 1,
    " i'm not gonna hurt you": 1,
    " This is loop feedback.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " I don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate, but my point is it's the sound of self-destruction.": 1,
    " And I've been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms from, say, the ecological, okay?": 1,
    "There seems to be a...": 1,
    " A rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from, it gets ugly.": 1,
    "So you can't feed cows their own brains or you get mad cow disease.": 1,
    " inbreeding and incest and let's see what's what's the other one biological there's autoimmune diseases where the body attacks itself": 1,
    " little too over zealously and destroys the host, the person.": 1,
    "And then...": 1,
    " Okay, this is where we get to the song, kind of bridges the gap to the emotional, because although I've used scientific terms in songs, it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical.": 1,
    " And there's some things you just don't need to have in songs, but so I'm trying to bridge this gap between this idea and this melody.": 1,
    "And so I don't know if you ever had this, but I": 1,
    " When I close my eyes sometimes and try to sleep, I can't stop thinking about my own eyes.": 1,
    " And it's like your eyes start straining to see themselves.": 1,
    " That's what it feels like to me.": 1,
    "It's not pleasant.": 1,
    "I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head.": 1,
    " But it's impossible, of course, for your eyes to see themselves, but they seem to be trying.": 1,
    "And so that's getting a little more closer to a personal experience.": 1,
    "Or ears being able to hear themselves.": 1,
    "It's just impossible.": 1,
    " That's the thing.": 1,
    "So, I've been working on this song that mentions these things.": 1,
    " And then also imagines a person who's been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that they're left to do the deed themselves, if that's possible, and that's what the song is asking.": 1,
    " Doesn't have a name yet.": 1,
    " Go ahead and congratulate yourself Give yourself a hand, the hand is your hand And the eye that eyes itself is your eye And the ear that hears itself is near": 1,
    " Cause it's your year, oh You've done the impossible now Took yourself apart": 1,
    " You made yourself invulnerable No one can break your heart": 1,
    " So you wear it out": 1,
    " And you wring it out And you wear it out And you break it yourself": 1,
    " Bringing your own, bringing your sin, bringing your own, bringing your sin, bringing your own": 1,
    " Thanks.": 1,
    " All right.": 1,
    "It's kind of cool, like songwriters can sort of get away with murder.": 1,
    "You don't really have, you can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs.": 1,
