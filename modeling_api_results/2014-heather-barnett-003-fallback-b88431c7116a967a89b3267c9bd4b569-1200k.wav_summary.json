    " I'd like to introduce you to an organism, a slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.": 1,
    "It's a mold with an identity crisis because it's not a mold.": 1,
    "So let's get that straight to start with.": 1,
    " It is one of 700 known slime molds belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba.": 1,
    "It is a single-celled organism, a cell, that joins together with other cells to form a mass supercell to maximize its resources.": 1,
    " So within a slime mold, you might find thousands or millions of nuclei, all sharing a cell wall, all operating as one entity.": 1,
    " In its natural habitat, you might find the slime mold foraging in woodlands, eating rotting vegetation.": 1,
    " But you might equally find it in research laboratories, classrooms, and even artist studios.": 1,
    "I first came across the slime mold about five years ago, a microbiologist friend of mine.": 1,
    " gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it and told me to go home and play with it.": 1,
    " The only instructions I were given that it likes it dark and damp and its favorite food is porridge oats.": 1,
    " I'm an artist who's worked for many years with biology, with scientific processes.": 1,
    "So living material is not uncommon for me.": 1,
    "I've worked with plants, bacteria, cuttlefish, fruit flies.": 1,
    "So I was keen to get my new collaborator home to see what it could do.": 1,
    " So I took it home and I watched.": 1,
    " I fed it a varied diet.": 1,
    "I observed as it networked, it formed a connection between food sources.": 1,
    "I watched it leave a trail behind it, indicating where it had been.": 1,
    " And I noticed that when it was fed up with one petri dish, it would escape and find a better home.": 1,
    "I captured my observations through time-lapse photography.": 1,
    " Slime mold grows at about one centimeter an hour, so it's not really ideal for live viewing unless there's some form of really extreme meditation.": 1,
    "But through the time lapse,": 1,
    " I could observe some really interesting behaviors.": 1,
    "For instance, having fed on a nice pile of oats, the slime mold goes off to explore new territories in different directions simultaneously.": 1,
    " When it meets itself, it knows it's already there.": 1,
    "It recognizes it's there, and instead retreats back and grows in other directions.": 1,
    " I was quite impressed by this feat, how what was essentially just a bag of cellular slime could somehow map its territory, know itself, and move with seeming intention.": 1,
    " I found countless scientific studies, research papers, journal articles, all citing incredible work with this one organism.": 1,
    " I'm going to share a few of those with you.": 1,
    "For example, a team in Hokkaido University in Japan filled a maze with slime mold.": 1,
    "It joined together and formed a mass cell.": 1,
    " They introduced food at Two Points Oaks, of course, and it formed a connection between the food.": 1,
    "It retracted from empty areas and dead ends.": 1,
    " There are four possible routes through this maze, yet time and time again, the slime mold established the shortest and the most efficient route.": 1,
    " The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold had a primitive form of intelligence.": 1,
    " Another study exposed cold air at regular intervals to the slime mold.": 1,
    "It didn't like it.": 1,
    "It doesn't like it cold.": 1,
    "It doesn't like it dry.": 1,
    "They did this at repeat intervals.": 1,
    "And each time, the slime mold slowed down its growth in response.": 1,
    " However, the next interval, the researchers didn't put the cold air on, yet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation of it happening.": 1,
    " It somehow knew that it was about the time for the cold air that it didn't like.": 1,
    "The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold was able to learn.": 1,
    " A third experiment.": 1,
    "The slime mold was invited to explore a territory covered in oats.": 1,
    "It fans out in a branching pattern.": 1,
    " As it goes, each food node it finds, it forms a network connection to and keeps foraging.": 1,
    "After 26 hours, it established quite a firm network.": 1,
    " between the different Oats.": 1,
    "Now, there's nothing remarkable in this until you learn that the center Oat that it started from represents the city of Tokyo, and the surrounding Oats are suburban railway stations.": 1,
    " The slime mold had replicated the Tokyo transport network.": 1,
    " A complex system developed over time by community dwelling, civil engineering, urban planning, what taken us well over 100 years took the slime mold just over a day.": 1,
    " The conclusion from their experiment was that the slime mold can form efficient networks and solve the traveling salesman problem.": 1,
    "It is a biological computer.": 1,
    " As such, it has been mathematically modelled, algorithmically analysed, it's been sonified, replicated, simulated.": 1,
    "World over, teams of researchers are decoding its biological principles to understand its computational rules.": 1,
    " and applying that learning to the fields of electronics, programming and robotics.": 1,
    " So the question is, how does this thing work?": 1,
    "It doesn't have a central nervous system, it doesn't have a brain, yet it can perform behaviors that we associate with brain function.": 1,
    " It can learn, it can remember, it can solve problems, it can make decisions.": 1,
    " So where does that intelligence lie?": 1,
    "So this is a microscopy video I shot, and it's about 100 times magnification, sped up to about 20 times.": 1,
    " And inside the slime mold, there is a rhythmic pulsing flow, a vein-like structure carrying cellular material, nutrients, and chemical information.": 1,
    " through the cell, streaming first in one direction and then back in another.": 1,
    "And it's this continuous, synchronous": 1,
    " oscillation within the cell that allows it to form quite a complex understanding of its environment but without any large-scale control center.": 1,
    "This is where its intelligence lies.": 1,
    " So it's not just academic researchers in universities that are interested in this organism.": 1,
    "A few years ago, I set up Slimeoco, the slime mold collective.": 1,
    " It's an online, open, democratic network for slime mold researchers and enthusiasts to share knowledge and experimentation across disciplinary divides and across academic divides.": 1,
    " The slime mold collective membership is self-selecting.": 1,
    "People have found the collective as the slime mold finds the oats.": 1,
    " And it comprises of scientists and computer scientists and researchers, but also artists like me, architects, designers, writers, activists, you name it.": 1,
    "It's a very interesting and collective membership.": 1,
    " Just a few examples, an artist who paints with fluorescent physarum, a collaborative team who are combining biological and electronic design with 3D printing technologies in a workshop.": 1,
    " Another artist who's using the slime mold as a way of engaging a community to map their area.": 1,
    "Here the slime mold has been used directly as a biological tool but metaphorically as a symbol for ways of talking about": 1,
    " social cohesion, communication and cooperation.": 1,
    " Other public engagement activities, I run lots of slime mold workshops, a creative way of engaging with the organism.": 1,
    "So people are invited to come and learn about what amazing things it can do.": 1,
    " They design their own Petri experiment, an environment for the slime mold to navigate.": 1,
    "They can test its properties.": 1,
    "Everybody takes home a new pet and is invited to post their results on the slime mold collective.": 1,
    " And the collective has enabled me to form collaborations with a whole array of interesting people.": 1,
    "I've been working with filmmakers on a feature-length slime mold documentary, and I stress feature-length.": 1,
    " which is in the final stages of edit and will be hitting your cinema screens very soon.": 1,
    " It's also enabled me to conduct what I think is the world's first human slime mold experiment.": 1,
    "This is part of an exhibition in Rotterdam last year.": 1,
    " we invited people to become slime mold for half an hour.": 1,
    "So we essentially tied people together, so they were a giant cell, and invited them to follow slime mold rules.": 1,
    " You have to communicate through oscillations, no speaking.": 1,
    "You have to operate as one entity, one mass cell, no egos.": 1,
    " And the motivation for moving and exploring the environment is in search of food.": 1,
    " The chaotic shuffle ensued as this bunch of strangers tied together with yellow robes, wearing being slime old t-shirts, wandered through the museum park.": 1,
    " But when they met trees, they had to reshape their connections and reform as a mass cell through not speaking.": 1,
    " This is a ludicrous experiment in many, many ways.": 1,
    "This isn't hypothesis-driven.": 1,
    "I'm not trying to prove, demonstrate anything.": 1,
    " But what it did provide us with a way of engaging a broad section of the public with ideas of intelligence, agency, autonomy, and provide a playful platform for discussions about": 1,
    " the things that ensued.": 1,
    "One of the most exciting things about this experiment was the conversation that happened afterwards.": 1,
    "An entirely spontaneous symposium happened in the park.": 1,
    " People talked about the human psychology of how difficult it was to let go of their individual personalities and egos.": 1,
    "Other people talked about bacterial communication.": 1,
    " Each person bring in their own individual interpretation.": 1,
    "And our conclusion from this experiment was that the people of Rotterdam were highly cooperative, especially when given beer.": 1,
    " We didn't just give them oats, we gave them beer as well.": 1,
    "But they weren't as efficient as the slime mold.": 1,
    "And the slime mold, for me,": 1,
    " It's a fascinating subject matter, it's biologically fascinating, it's computationally interesting, but it's also a symbol, a way of engaging with ideas of community, collective behaviour, cooperation.": 1,
    " A lot of my work draws on the scientific research, so this pays homage to the maze experiment, but in a different way.": 1,
    "This lime mold is also my working material.": 1,
    "It's a co-producer.": 1,
    " of photographs, prints, animations, participatory events.": 1,
    "Whilst the slime mold doesn't choose to work with me exactly, it is a collaboration of sorts.": 1,
    " I can predict certain behaviors by understanding how it operates, but I can't control it.": 1,
    "The slime mold has the final say in the creative process.": 1,
    "And after all, it has its own internal aesthetics.": 1,
    " these branching patterns that we see, we see across all forms, scales of nature, from river deltas to lightning strikes, from our own blood vessels to neural networks.": 1,
    " There's clearly significant rules at play in this simple yet complex organism.": 1,
    "And no matter what our disciplinary perspective or our mode of inquiry, there's a great deal that we can learn from observing and engaging with this beautiful, brainless blob.": 1,
    " I give you Pfizer and polycephaline.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
