    " I've got a great idea.": 1,
    "It's going to change the world.": 1,
    "It's fantastic.": 1,
    "It's going to blow your mind.": 1,
    "It's my beautiful baby.": 1,
    "Here's the thing.": 1,
    "Everybody loves a beautiful baby.": 1,
    "I mean, I was a beautiful baby.": 1,
    " Here's me and my dad a couple days after I was born.": 1,
    "So in the world of product design, the beautiful baby is like the concept car.": 1,
    "It's the knockout.": 1,
    "You see it and you go, oh my god, I'd buy that in a second.": 1,
    " So why is it that this year's new cars look pretty much exactly like last year's new cars?": 1,
    " What went wrong between the design studio and the factory?": 1,
    "See, today I don't want to talk about beautiful babies.": 1,
    "I want to talk about the awkward adolescence of design.": 1,
    "Those sort of...": 1,
    " to our key teenage years where you're trying to figure out how the world works.": 1,
    "I'm going to start with an example from some work that we did on newborn health.": 1,
    " So here's the problem.": 1,
    "Four million babies around the world, mostly in developing countries, die every year before their first birthday, even before their first month of life.": 1,
    "It turns out half of those kids, or about 1.8 million newborns around the world, wouldn't make it.": 1,
    " If you could just keep them warm for the first three days, maybe the first week.": 1,
    "So this is a newborn intensive care unit in Katmandu, Nepal.": 1,
    "All of these kids in blankets belong in incubators, something like this.": 1,
    " So this is a donated Japanese atom incubator that we found in a NICU in Kathmandu.": 1,
    "This is what we want.": 1,
    "Probably what happened is a hospital in Japan upgraded their equipment and donated their old stuff to Nepal.": 1,
    " Problem is, without technicians, without spare parts, donations like this very quickly turn into junk.": 1,
    " So this seemed like a problem that we could do something about.": 1,
    "I mean, keeping a baby warm for a week, that's not rocket science.": 1,
    " We got started.": 1,
    "We partnered with a leading medical research institution here in Boston.": 1,
    "We conducted months of user research overseas trying to think like designers, human-centered design.": 1,
    "Let's figure out what people want.": 1,
    " We killed thousands of Post-it notes.": 1,
    "We made dozens of prototypes to get to this.": 1,
    "So this is the Neonurture infant incubator.": 1,
    "And this has a lot of smarts built into it.": 1,
    "And we felt great.": 1,
    "So the idea here is,": 1,
    " Unlike the concept car, we want to marry something beautiful with something that actually works.": 1,
    "And our idea is that this design would inspire manufacturers and other people of influence to sort of take this model and run with it.": 1,
    " Here's the bad news.": 1,
    "The only baby ever actually put inside the neo-nurture incubator was this kid during a Time Magazine photo shoot.": 1,
    " So recognition is fantastic.": 1,
    "We want design to get out for people to see it.": 1,
    "It won lots of awards.": 1,
    "But it felt like a booby prize.": 1,
    " We wanted to make beautiful things that are going to make the world a better place.": 1,
    "That are going to make the world a better place.": 1,
    "And I don't think this kid was even in it long enough to get warm.": 1,
    "So it turns out that Design for Inspiration doesn't really...": 1,
    " I guess what I would say is that for us, for what I want to do, it's either too slow or it just doesn't work.": 1,
    "It's ineffective.": 1,
    "So really, I want to design for outcomes.": 1,
    "I don't want to make beautiful stuff.": 1,
    "I want to make the world a better place.": 1,
    " So when we were designing Neonurture, we paid a lot of attention to the people who are going to use this thing.": 1,
    "For example, poor families, rural doctors, overloaded nurses, even repair technicians.": 1,
    " We thought we had all our bases covered.": 1,
    "We'd done everything right.": 1,
    "Well, it turns out there's this whole constellation of people who have to be involved in a product for it to be successful.": 1,
    "Manufacturing, financing, distribution, regulation.": 1,
    " Michael Freit Pass says you have to figure out who will choose, use, and pay the dues for a product like this.": 1,
    "And I have to ask a question, you know, VCs always ask, well, sir, what is your business and who is your customer?": 1,
    "Who is our customer?": 1,
    " Well, here's an example.": 1,
    "This is a Bangladeshi hospital director outside his facility.": 1,
    "It turns out he doesn't buy any of his equipment.": 1,
    "Those decisions are made by the Ministry of Health or by foreign donors, and it just kind of shows up.": 1,
    " Similarly, here's a multinational medical device manufacturer.": 1,
    "Turns out they got to fish where the fish are.": 1,
    "So it turns out that in emerging markets where the fish are,": 1,
    " are sort of the emerging middle class of these countries, diseases of affluence, heart disease, infertility.": 1,
    "So turns out that design for outcomes": 1,
    " in one aspect really means thinking about design for manufacturing distribution.": 1,
    "Okay, that was an important lesson.": 1,
    "Second,": 1,
    " We took that lesson and tried to push it into our next project.": 1,
    "So we started by finding a manufacturer, an organization called MTTS in Vietnam that manufactures newborn care technologies for Southeast Asia.": 1,
    " Our other partner is East Meets West.": 1,
    "This is an American foundation that distributes that technology to poor hospitals around that region.": 1,
    "So we started with them saying, well, what do you want?": 1,
    "What's a problem you want to solve?": 1,
    "And they said, well, let's work on newborn jaundice.": 1,
    " So this is another one of these mind-boggling global problems.": 1,
    "So jaundice affects two-thirds of newborns around the world.": 1,
    "Of those newborns, one in ten, roughly.": 1,
    " If it's not treated, the jaundice gets so severe that it leads to either a lifelong disability or the kids could even die.": 1,
    " There's one way to treat jaundice, and that's what's called an exchange transfusion.": 1,
    "So, as you can imagine, that's expensive and a little bit dangerous.": 1,
    " There is another cure.": 1,
    "It's very technological.": 1,
    "It's very complex.": 1,
    "A little daunting.": 1,
    "You got to shine blue light on the kid.": 1,
    " bright blue light on as much of the skin as you can cover.": 1,
    "How is this a hard problem?": 1,
    "So I went to MIT.": 1,
    "OK.": 1,
    "We'll figure that out.": 1,
    " So here's an example.": 1,
    "This is an overhead phototherapy device that's designed for American hospitals.": 1,
    "And here's how it's supposed to be used.": 1,
    "So it's over the baby, illuminating it to signal patient.": 1,
    " Take it out in an American hospital, send it overseas to a crowded facility in Asia.": 1,
    "Here's how it's actually used.": 1,
    "The effectiveness of phototherapy is a function of light intensity.": 1,
    "So these dark blue squares show you where it's effective phototherapy.": 1,
    " Here's what it looks like under actual use.": 1,
    "So those kids on the edges aren't actually receiving effective phototherapy, but without training, without some kind of light meter, how would you know?": 1,
    " We see other examples of problems like this.": 1,
    "So here's the neonatal intensive care unit where moms come in to visit their babies.": 1,
    "And keep in mind that mom maybe just had a C-section.": 1,
    "OK, so that's already kind of a bummer.": 1,
    " Mom's visiting her kid, she sees her baby naked, lying under some blue lights, looking kind of vulnerable.": 1,
    "It's not uncommon for mom to put a blanket over the baby.": 1,
    " From a phototherapy standpoint, maybe not the best behavior.": 1,
    "In fact, that sounds kind of dumb, except what we've learned is that there's no such thing as a dumb user.": 1,
    " really is what we've learned.": 1,
    "They're only dumb products.": 1,
    "We have to think like existentialists.": 1,
    "It's not the painting we would have painted.": 1,
    "It's the painting that we actually painted.": 1,
    "It's the use designed for actual use.": 1,
    "How are people actually going to use this?": 1,
    " So similarly, when we think about our partner, MTTS, they've made some amazing technologies for treating newborn illnesses.": 1,
    "So here's an overhead warmer and a CPAP.": 1,
    "They're inexpensive.": 1,
    " Really rugged.": 1,
    "They've treated 50,000 kids in Vietnam with this technology.": 1,
    "But here's the problem.": 1,
    "Every doctor in the world, every hospital administrator has seen TV, you know, curse those whatever ER reruns.": 1,
    " Turns out they all know what a medical device is supposed to look like.": 1,
    "They want Buck Rogers.": 1,
    "They don't want effective.": 1,
    "It sounds crazy, it sounds dumb, but there are actually hospitals that would rather have no equipment than something that looks cheap and crummy.": 1,
    " So again, if we want people to trust the device, it has to look trustworthy.": 1,
    "So thinking about outcomes turns out appearances matter.": 1,
    " So we took all that information together, we tried this time to get it right, and here's what we developed.": 1,
    "So this is the Firefly phototherapy device, except this time we didn't stop at the concept car.": 1,
    " So from the very beginning, we started by talking to manufacturers, like our goal is to make a state of the art product that our partner MTTS can actually manufacture.": 1,
    "So our goal is to study how they work, the resources that they have access to.": 1,
    " so that they can make this product.": 1,
    "So that's the design for manufacture question.": 1,
    "When we think about actual use, you'll notice that Firefly has a single bassinet.": 1,
    "It only fits a single baby.": 1,
    "And the idea here is that it's obvious.": 1,
    " how you ought to use this device.": 1,
    "If you try to put more than one kid in, you're kind of stacking them on top of each other.": 1,
    " The idea here is we say you want to make it hard to use wrong.": 1,
    "In other words, you want to make the right way to use it the easiest way to use it.": 1,
    "Another example, again,": 1,
    " Silly mom, you know, silly mom thinks her baby looks cold, wants to put a blanket over the baby.": 1,
    "Well, that's why we have lights above and below the baby in Firefly.": 1,
    "So if mom does put a blanket over the baby, still receiving effective phototherapy from below.": 1,
    " Last story here, I've got a friend in India who told me that you haven't really tested a piece of electronic technology for distribution in Asia until you've trained a cockroach to climb in and pee on every single little component on the inside.": 1,
    " You think it's funny, I had a laptop in the P score and the screen had all these dead pixels on it and one day I looked in and they were all dead ants that had gotten into my laptop and perished those poor ants.": 1,
    " So with Firefly, what we did is the problem is electronics get hot, and you have to put in vents or fans to keep them cool in most products.": 1,
    " We decided that, OK, I can't put a do not enter sign next to the vent, this kind of thing.": 1,
    "We actually got rid of all that stuff.": 1,
    "So Firefly's totally sealed.": 1,
    " These are the kind of lessons, I mean, as awkward as it was to be a pretty goofy teenager, much worse to be a frustrated designer.": 1,
    "So thinking about, okay, what I really want to do is change the world.": 1,
    "I have to pay attention to manufacturing and distribution.": 1,
    "I have to pay attention to how people are actually going to use": 1,
    " a device.": 1,
    "I actually have to pay attention.": 1,
    "Really, there's no excuse for failure.": 1,
    "I have to think like an existentialist.": 1,
    "I have to accept that there are no dumb users.": 1,
    "There's only dumb products.": 1,
    "We have to ask ourselves hard questions.": 1,
    "Are we designing for the world that we want?": 1,
    " Are we designing for the world that we have?": 1,
    "Are we designing for the world that's coming, whether we're ready or not?": 1,
    "I got into this business designing products.": 1,
    " I've since learned that if you really want to make a difference in the world, you have to design outcomes.": 1,
    "And that's design that matters.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
