    " I'd like to talk to you today about a whole new way to think about sexual activity and sexuality education by comparison.": 1,
    " If you talk to someone today in America about sexual activity, you'll find pretty soon you're not just talking about sexual activity, you're also talking about baseball.": 1,
    " Because baseball is the dominant cultural metaphor that Americans use to think about and talk about sexual activity.": 1,
    " And we know that because there's all this language in English that seems to be talking about baseball, but that's really talking about sexual activity.": 1,
    "So for example,": 1,
    " It can be a pitcher or a catcher, and that corresponds to whether you perform a sexual act or receive a sexual act.": 1,
    "Of course, there are the bases, which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order.": 1,
    " ultimately resulting in a scoring a run or hitting a home run, which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm, at least for the guy.": 1,
    " You can strike out, which means you don't get to have any sexual activity.": 1,
    " And if you're a benchwarmer, you might be a virgin or somebody for whom whatever reason isn't in the game, maybe because of your age or because of your ability or because of your skill set.": 1,
    " A bat's a penis, and a nappy dugout is a vulva or a vagina.": 1,
    " A glove or a catcher's mitt is a condom.": 1,
    " A switch hitter is a bisexual person, and we gay and lesbian folks play for the other team.": 1,
    "And then there's this one.": 1,
    "If there's grass on the fields, play ball.": 1,
    " And that usually refers to if a young person, specifically often a young woman, is old enough to have pubic hair, she's old enough to have sex with.": 1,
    " This baseball model is incredibly problematic.": 1,
    "It's sexist, it's heterosexist, it's competitive, it's goal-directed, and it can't result in healthy sexuality developing in young people or in adults.": 1,
    " So we need a new model.": 1,
    "I'm here today to offer you that new model, and it's based on pizza.": 1,
    " Now pizza is something that is universally understood and that most people associate with a positive experience.": 1,
    "So let's do this.": 1,
    "Let's take baseball and pizza and compare it when talking about three aspects of sexual activity.": 1,
    " the trigger for sexual activity, what happens during sexual activity, and the expected outcome of sexual activity.": 1,
    " When do you play baseball?": 1,
    "You play baseball when it's baseball season and when there's a game on the schedule.": 1,
    "It's not exactly your choice.": 1,
    " So if it's prom night or a wedding night or at a party or if our parents are in home, hey, it's just batter up.": 1,
    " Can you imagine saying to your coach, I'm not really feeling it today.": 1,
    "I think I'll sit this game out.": 1,
    "That's just not the way it happens.": 1,
    " And when you get together to play baseball, immediately you're with two opposing teams.": 1,
    "One playing offense, one playing defense.": 1,
    "Somebody's trying to move deeper into the field.": 1,
    " That's usually assigned to the boy.": 1,
    "Somebody's trying to defend people moving into the field.": 1,
    "That's often given to the girl.": 1,
    " It's competitive.": 1,
    "We're not playing with each other.": 1,
    "We're playing against each other.": 1,
    "And when you show up to play baseball, nobody needs to talk about what we're going to do or how this baseball game might be good for us.": 1,
    " Everybody knows the rules.": 1,
    "You just take your position and play the game.": 1,
    " But when do you have pizza?": 1,
    "Well, you have pizza when you're hungry for pizza.": 1,
    "It starts with an internal sense, an internal desire or a need, huh?": 1,
    "I could go for some pizza.": 1,
    " And because it's an internal desire, we actually have some sense of control over that.": 1,
    "I can decide that I'm hungry, but know that it's not a great time to eat.": 1,
    " And then when we get together with someone for pizza, we're not competing with them.": 1,
    "We're looking for an experience that both of us will share that's satisfying for both of us.": 1,
    "And when you get together for pizza with somebody, what's the first thing you do?": 1,
    " You talk about it.": 1,
    "You talk about what you want.": 1,
    "You talk about what you like.": 1,
    "You may even negotiate.": 1,
    "How do you feel about pepperoni?": 1,
    "Not so much.": 1,
    "I'm kind of a mushroom guy myself.": 1,
    "Well, maybe we can go half and half.": 1,
    " And even if you've had pizza with somebody for a very long time, don't you still say things like, should we get the usual?": 1,
    " or maybe something a little more adventurous.": 1,
    " Okay, so when you're playing baseball, so if you talk about during sexual activity, when you're playing baseball, you're just supposed to round the bases in the proper order, one at a time.": 1,
    "You can't hit the ball and run to right field.": 1,
    " That doesn't work.": 1,
    "And you also can't get to second base and say, I like it here.": 1,
    "I'm going to stay here.": 1,
    " No.": 1,
    " And also, of course, with baseball, there's like the specific equipment and a specific skill set.": 1,
    "Not everybody can play baseball.": 1,
    "It's pretty exclusive.": 1,
    "Okay, but what about pizza?": 1,
    "When we're trying to figure out what's good for pizza, isn't it all about": 1,
    " What's our pleasure?": 1,
    "There are a million different kinds of pizza.": 1,
    "There's a million different toppings.": 1,
    "There's a million different ways to eat pizza.": 1,
    "And none of them are wrong.": 1,
    " They're different.": 1,
    "And in this case, difference is good because that's going to increase the chance that we're having a satisfying experience.": 1,
    "And lastly, what's the expected outcome of baseball?": 1,
    "Well, in baseball, you play to win.": 1,
    " You score as many runs as you can.": 1,
    "There's always a winner in baseball, and that means there's always a loser in baseball.": 1,
    " But what about pizza?": 1,
    "Well, in pizza, we're not really, there's no winning.": 1,
    "How do you win pizza?": 1,
    " You don't, but you do look for, are we satisfied?": 1,
    "And sometimes that can be different amounts over different times or with different people or in different days.": 1,
    " And we get to decide when we feel satisfied.": 1,
    "If we're still hungry, we might have some more.": 1,
    "If you eat too much though, you just feel gross.": 1,
    " So what if we could take this pizza model and overlay it on top of sexuality education?": 1,
    "A lot of sexuality education that happens today is so influenced by the baseball model and it sets up education that can't help.": 1,
    " but produce unhealthy sexuality in young people and those young people become older people.": 1,
    "But if we could create sexuality education that was more like pizza": 1,
    " we could create education that invites people to think about their own desires, to make deliberate decisions about what they want,": 1,
    " to talk about it with their partners and to ultimately look for not some external outcome, but for what feels satisfying.": 1,
    "And we get to decide that.": 1,
    " You may have noticed in the baseball and pizza comparison, under the baseball, it's all commands.": 1,
    "They're all exclamation points.": 1,
    " But under the pizza model, they're questions.": 1,
    "And who gets to answer those questions?": 1,
    "You do.": 1,
    "I do.": 1,
    " So remember, when we're thinking about sexuality education and sexual activity, baseball, you're out.": 1,
    " Pizza is the way to think about healthy, satisfying sexual activity and good comprehensive sexuality education.": 1,
    "Thank you very much for your time.": 1
