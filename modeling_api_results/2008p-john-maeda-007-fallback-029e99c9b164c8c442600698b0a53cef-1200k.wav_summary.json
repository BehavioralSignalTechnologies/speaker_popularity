    "Yes.": 2,
    " Right?": 2,
    " I'm kind of tired of talking about simplicity, actually, so I thought I'd make it more complex.": 1,
    "It's a serious play.": 1,
    "So I'm going to go through some slides from way back when and walk through them to give you a sense of how I ended up here.": 1,
    " Basically it all began with this whole idea of a computer.": 1,
    "Who has a computer?": 1,
    " Yeah, okay, so everyone pretty has a computer.": 1,
    "You have a mobile phone, it's a computer.": 1,
    " And anyone remember this workbook?": 1,
    "Instant Activities for Your Apple?": 1,
    "Free poster in each book.": 1,
    "This was how computing began.": 1,
    "Don't forget, the computer came out, it had no software.": 1,
    " You'd buy that thing, you'd bring it home, you'd plug it in, and it would do absolutely nothing at all.": 1,
    " So you had to program it.": 1,
    "And there were great programming tutorials like this.": 1,
    "I mean, this was great.": 1,
    "It's like Herbie the Apple II.": 1,
    "It's such a great way to, I mean, they should make Java books like this.": 1,
    " and we'd have no problem in a program.": 1,
    "But this was a great grand time of the computer when it was just a raw, raw, what is it?": 1,
    "Kind of an error.": 1,
    " And you see, this era coincided with my own childhood.": 1,
    "I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.": 1,
    "Who of you grew up in a family business?": 1,
    " Suffered the torture.": 1,
    "The torture was good.": 1,
    "Wasn't a good torture.": 1,
    "It was just life changing, you know, and so in my life, you know, I was in the tofu.": 1,
    "It was a family business and my mother was a kind of a designer also.": 1,
    " She'd make this kind of like wall of tofu cooking, and it would confuse the customers because they all thought it was a restaurant.": 1,
    "It's a bad sort of branding thing, whatever.": 1,
    "But anyway, that's where I grew up, in this little tofu factory in Seattle.": 1,
    " And it was kind of like this, a small room where I kind of grew up.": 1,
    "I'm big there in that picture.": 1,
    "That's my dad.": 1,
    "My dad was kind of like MacGyver, really.": 1,
    " He would invent ways to make things heavy, like back here there's a concrete block technology here, and he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu, because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing, and so you have to have heavy stuff.": 1,
    " to push out the liquid and make it hard.": 1,
    "Tofu comes out in these big batches and my father would have cut them by hand.": 1,
    " I can't tell you, family business story, you'd understand this.": 1,
    "My father was the most sincere man possible.": 1,
    "He'd walk, he walked into a Safeway once, on a rainy day, slipped, broke his arm, rushed out, didn't want an inconvenient Safeway.": 1,
    " So instead, you know, my father's like arms broken for two weeks in the store.": 1,
    "And that week, that those two weeks were when my older brother and I had to do everything.": 1,
    "And that was torture, real torture.": 1,
    " Because you see, we'd see my father taking the big block of tofu and cutting it, like knife in, zap, zap, zap.": 1,
    "We thought, wow.": 1,
    "So the first time I did it, I went, whoa, like this.": 1,
    "Bad blocks.": 1,
    " But anyways, the tofu to me was kind of my origin basically.": 1,
    " And because working in the store was so hard, I liked going to school.": 1,
    "It was like heaven.": 1,
    "And I was really good at school.": 1,
    "So when I got to MIT, as most of you who are creatives, your parents all told you not to be creative.": 1,
    "It's the same way, you know, I was good at art and good at math and my father says his John's good at math.": 1,
    "I went to MIT, did my math, but I had this wonderful opportunity because computers had just become visual.": 1,
    " Macintosh just came out.": 1,
    "I had a Mac in hand when I went to MIT.": 1,
    "And it was a time when a guy who kind of could cross the two sides, it was a good time.": 1,
    "And so I remember that my first major piece of software was a direct copy": 1,
    " of then Aldous PageMaker.": 1,
    "I made a desktop publishing system way back when and that was kind of my first step into figuring out how to": 1,
    " These two sides are kind of fun to mix.": 1,
    "And the problem when you're younger, for all you students out there, is your head gets kind of big really easy.": 1,
    " And when I was making icons, I was like the icon master.": 1,
    "And I was like, yeah, I'm really good at this, you know?": 1,
    "And then luckily, you know, I had the fortune of going to something called a library.": 1,
    " And in the library, I came upon this very book.": 1,
    "I found this book.": 1,
    "It's called Thoughts on Design by a man named Paul Rand.": 1,
    " It's a little slim volume, I'm not sure if you've seen this, but it's a very nice little book, and it's about this guy, Paul Rand, who was one of the greatest graphic designers and also a great writer as well.": 1,
    "And when I saw this man's work, I realized how bad I was at design.": 1,
    " or whatever I called it back then.": 1,
    "And I suddenly had a kind of a career goal kind of in hot pursuit.": 1,
    " So I kind of switched.": 1,
    "I went to MIT, finished.": 1,
    "I got my master's and then went to art school after that.": 1,
    "And I've just been designing stuff, like chopstick wrappers, napkins, menus, whatever I could get a handle on.": 1,
    " wheel and deal, move up in the design world, whatever.": 1,
    "And isn't there that strange moment where you publish your design?": 1,
    "Who remembers that moment?": 1,
    "Publishing your designs?": 1,
    "Remember that moment?": 1,
    "Felt so good, didn't it?": 1,
    "So I was published, and I was like, wow, my design's in a book, you know?": 1,
    " After that things kind of got strange and I got thinking about the computer because the computer to me always kind of bothered me.": 1,
    " I didn't quite get it.": 1,
    "And Paul Rand was a kind of crusty designer.": 1,
    "Isn't he a crusty designer?": 1,
    "Kind of like a good French bread.": 1,
    " He wrote in one of his books, a Yale student once said, I came here to learn how to design, not how to use a computer.": 1,
    "Design schools take heat.": 1,
    "This is in the 80s, in the great clash.": 1,
    " of computer, non-computer people.": 1,
    "Very difficult time actually.": 1,
    "And this to me was an important message from Wren.": 1,
    "And": 1,
    " So I began to sort of mess with the computer at the time.": 1,
    "This is the first sort of play thing I did, my own serious play.": 1,
    "I built a working version of Adobe Illustrator-ish thing.": 1,
    " It looks like Illustrator.": 1,
    "It was very hard to make this actually.": 1,
    "It took a month to make this part.": 1,
    "And then I thought, what if I added this feature where I can say, this point, you can fly like a bird.": 1,
    "You're a free kind of thing.": 1,
    " And so I can sort of change the kind of stability with a little control there on the dial.": 1,
    "And you can sort of watch it sort of flip around.": 1,
    "And this is in 1993.": 1,
    "And when my professors saw this, they were very upset at me.": 1,
    " They were saying, why is it moving?": 1,
    "They were saying, make it stop now.": 1,
    "And I was saying, well, that's the whole point.": 1,
    "It's moving.": 1,
    "And he says, well, when is it going to stop?": 1,
    "And I said, never.": 1,
    "And they said, even worse, stop it now.": 1,
    " That's how I got started on this whole idea of like, what is this computer?": 1,
    "It's a strange medium.": 1,
    "It's not like print.": 1,
    "It's not like a video.": 1,
    "It lasts forever.": 1,
    "It's a very strange medium.": 1,
    "So I went off with this and began to look for things even more.": 1,
    " So in Japan, I began to experiment with people.": 1,
    "This is actually bad.": 1,
    "I would do these things where I would have students become pens.": 1,
    "There's blue pen, red pen, green pen, black pen.": 1,
    "Someone sits down and draws a picture.": 1,
    " Ready?": 1,
    " He said draw from the middle right to the middle and he kind of messed up.": 1,
    "See, humans don't know how to take orders.": 1,
    "The computer is so good at it.": 1,
    "This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once.": 1,
    " You know, you pen do this, and you pen do this.": 1,
    "And so it began to have multiple pens on the page.": 1,
    "Again, hard to do with our hands.": 1,
    "And then someone discovered this aha moment where you could use fourness systems.": 1,
    " We thought, ah, this is what's going to happen.": 1,
    "And then he drew a house.": 1,
    "It was the most boring thing.": 1,
    "It became computerish when we began to think computerish, the XY system.": 1,
    "And so that was kind of a revelation.": 1,
    " And after this, I wanted to build a computer out of people called the Human Power Computer.": 1,
    "So this happened in 1993.": 1,
    "Sound down, please.": 1,
    " It's a computer where the people are the parts.": 1,
    "I have behind this wall a disk drive, a CPU, a graphics card, a memory system.": 1,
    "They're picking up a giant floppy disk made out of cardboard.": 1,
    " It's put inside the computer.": 1,
    "And the actual program's on that cardboard disc.": 1,
    "So she wears a disc.": 1,
    " and reads the data off the sectors of the disk, and the computer starts up.": 1,
    "It sort of boots up, really, and it's sort of a working computer.": 1,
    "And when I built this computer, I had a moment of, what is it called, the epiphany where": 1,
    " I realized that the computer is just so fast.": 1,
    " This computer appears to be fast.": 1,
    "She's working pretty hard.": 1,
    "And people are running around.": 1,
    "And we think, wow, this is happening at a fast rate.": 1,
    "And this computer's programmed to do only one thing, which is if you move your mouse,": 1,
    " the mouse changes on the screen.": 1,
    "On the computer, when you move your mouse, that arrow moves around.": 1,
    "On this computer, if you move the mouse, it takes half an hour for the mouse cursor to change.": 1,
    "To give you a sense of speed, the scale, the computer is just so amazingly fast.": 1,
    " And so after this I began to do experiments with different companies.": 1,
    "This is something I did for Sony in 1996.": 1,
    "It was three Sony-ish devices that responded to sound.": 1,
    " So if you talk into the mic, you'll hear some music in your headphones.": 1,
    "If you talk into the phone, video would happen.": 1,
    "So I began to experiment with industry in different ways with this kind of mixture of skills.": 1,
    "I did this ad.": 1,
    "I don't believe in this kind of alcohol, but I do drink sometimes.": 1,
    " and Chanel.": 1,
    "So I'm going to do different projects.": 1,
    "And also one thing I realized is that I like to make things.": 1,
    " We like to make things.": 1,
    "It's fun to make things.": 1,
    "And so I never developed the ability to have a staff.": 1,
    "I have no staff.": 1,
    "It's all kind of made by hand, these sort of broken hands.": 1,
    "And these hands were influenced by this man, Mr. Inami Naomi.": 1,
    " This guy was my kind of like mentor.": 1,
    "He was the first digital media producer in Tokyo.": 1,
    "He's the guy that kind of discovered me and kind of got me going in digital media.": 1,
    "And he was such an inspirational guy.": 1,
    " I remember we'd be in his studio at 2 a.m., and then he'd show up from some client meeting.": 1,
    "He'd come in and say, you know, if I'm here, everything is okay.": 1,
    "And it feels so much better, you know?": 1,
    " And I'll never forget how like, but I'll never forget how like, he had a sudden situation with his aneurysm.": 1,
    " He went into a coma, and so for three years he was out, and he could only blink, and so I realized at this moment, I thought, wow, how fragile is this thing we're wearing, this body and mind we're wearing, and so I thought,": 1,
    " How do you go for it more?": 1,
    "How do you take that time you have left and go after it?": 1,
    "Tsunami was pivotal in that.": 1,
    "And so I began to think more carefully about the computer.": 1,
    "This is a moment where I was thinking about": 1,
    " So you have a computer program it responds to motion X and Y and I realized that.": 1,
    " Each computer program has all these images inside the program.": 1,
    "So if you can see here, that program you're seeing in the corner, if you spread it out, it's all these things all at once.": 1,
    "It's real simultaneity.": 1,
    "It's nothing we're used to working with.": 1,
    " We're so used to working in one vector.": 1,
    "This is all at the same time.": 1,
    "The computer lives in so many dimensions.": 1,
    "And also, at the same time, I was frustrated because I would go to all these art and design schools everywhere, and there were these, like, the computer lab.": 1,
    " And this is like in the late 1990s.": 1,
    "And this is in Basel, a great graphic design school.": 1,
    "And here's this like dirty, kind of shoddy, kind of dark computer room.": 1,
    "And again, I wonder, is this the goal?": 1,
    " Is this what we want?": 1,
    " Also, I began to be fascinated by machines, like copy machines.": 1,
    "And so this is actually in Basel.": 1,
    "I noticed how we spend so much time making it interactive.": 1,
    "This is like a touch screen.": 1,
    "And I noticed how it only touched five places.": 1,
    "And so why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere, became a question.": 1,
    " And also, the sound.": 1,
    "I discovered that can make my ThinkPad pretend it's a telephone.": 1,
    " You get it?": 1,
    "No.": 1,
    "Okay, next.": 1,
    "And also, I discovered in Logan Airport, this was like a calling out to me.": 1,
    " You hear that?": 1,
    "It's like cows.": 1,
    "This is at 4am in Logan.": 1,
    "So I was wondering, what is this thing in front of me, this computer thing?": 1,
    "It didn't make any sense.": 1,
    " So I began to make things again.": 1,
    "This is another series of objects made out of old computers from my basement.": 1,
    "I took my old Macintoshes and made different objects out of them for Tokyo.": 1,
    " I began to be very disinterested in computers themselves.": 1,
    "I began to make paintings out of palm pilots.": 1,
    "I made this series of works.": 1,
    "They're paintings I made and put a palm pilot in the middle as a kind of display that's sort of thinking I'm abstract art.": 1,
    " What am I?": 1,
    "I'm abstract.": 1,
    "And so it keeps thinking out loud of its own abstraction.": 1,
    " I began to be fascinated by plastic, so I spent four months making eight plastic blocks perfectly optically transparent as a kind of release of stress.": 1,
    "Because of that, I began to be interested in blue tape.": 1,
    " So in San Francisco, at CC, I had a whole exhibition on blue tape.": 1,
    "I made a whole installation on blue tape, blue painter's tape.": 1,
    "And at this point, my wife kind of got worried about me, so I stopped doing blue tape.": 1,
    " and begin to think, well, what else is there in life?": 1,
    "And so computers, as you know, these big computers, there are now tiny computers, they're little computers, they're the one-chip computers that begin to program": 1,
    " one-chip computers and make objects out of PC boards, LEDs.": 1,
    "I began to make LED sculptures that would live inside little boxes out of MDF.": 1,
    "This is a series of light boxes I made for a show in Italy.": 1,
    " Very simple.": 1,
    "You just press one button and some LED interaction occurs.": 1,
    "This is a series of lamps I made.": 1,
    "This is a bento box lamp.": 1,
    "It's sort of a plastic rice lamp.": 1,
    "It's very friendly.": 1,
    " I did a show in London last year made out of iPods.": 1,
    "I used iPods as a material.": 1,
    "So I took 16 iPod Nanos and made a kind of a nano fish basically recently.": 1,
    "This is for Reebok.": 1,
    "I'm doing shoes for Reebok as well.": 1,
    " as a kind of a hobby or an apparel.": 1,
    "So anyways, there are all these things you can do, but the thing I love the most is to experience, taste the world.": 1,
    "The world is just so tasty.": 1,
    " We think we'll go to a museum, that's where the tastes are.": 1,
    "No, they're all out there.": 1,
    "So this is like in front of the Eiffel Tower, really, actually, around the Louvre area.": 1,
    "This I found where nature had made a picture for me.": 1,
    " This is a perfect 90 degree angle by nature.": 1,
    "In a strange moment where like these things kind of appear.": 1,
    "We all are creative people.": 1,
    "We have this gene defect in our mind.": 1,
    "We can't help but stop.": 1,
    "This feeling is a wonderful thing.": 1,
    "It's the forever always on museum.": 1,
    "This is from the Cape last year.": 1,
    "I discovered that I had to find the equation of art and design, which we know as circle triangle square.": 1,
    " It's everywhere on the beach, I discovered.": 1,
    "I'm going to collect every instance of Circle, Triangle, Square.": 1,
    "I put these all back, by the way.": 1,
    "And I also discovered how some rocks are twins, separated at birth.": 1,
    " This is also out there.": 1,
    "I'm like, wow, how did this happen kind of thing?": 1,
    "I brought you guys together again.": 1,
    "So three years ago, I discovered the letters MIT occurring in simplicity and complexity.": 1,
    " my alma mater, MIT, and I had this moment, kind of my M. Night Shyamalan moment where I thought, whoa, I have to do this.": 1,
    "And I went after it with passion.": 1,
    " However, recently this RISD opportunity kind of arose, going to RISD, and I couldn't reconcile this really easily because the letters had told me MIT forever, but I discovered in the French word raison d'etre": 1,
    " I was like, uh-huh, wait a second.": 1,
    "And there RISD appeared.": 1,
    "And so I realized it was okay to go.": 1,
    " So I'm going to RISD, actually.": 1,
    "Who's a RISD alum out there?": 1,
    "RISD alums?": 1,
    "Yeah, RISD.": 1,
    "There we go, RISD.": 1,
    "Woo, RISD.": 1,
    " I'm sorry, Art Center is good too.": 1,
    "RISD is kind of my new kind of passion, and I'll tell you a little bit about that.": 1,
    " RISD is, I was outside RISD and some student wrote this on some block whatever, I thought wow RISD wants to know what itself is and I have no idea what RISD should be actually or what it wants to be but one thing I have to tell you is that": 1,
    " Although I'm a technologist, I don't like technology very much.": 1,
    "People say, are you going to bring RISD into the future?": 1,
    "And I say, well, I'm going to bring the future back to RISD, is my perspective, because in reality,": 1,
    " The problem isn't how to make the world more technological.": 1,
    " It's about how to make it more humane again.": 1,
    "And if anything, I think RISD has a strange DNA.": 1,
    "It's a strange exuberance about materials, about the world, a fascination that I think the world needs quite very much right now.": 1,
    " So thank you everyone.": 1
