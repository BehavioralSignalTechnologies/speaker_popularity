    "He joins the Army.": 3,
    "The Army gives him a rifle.": 3,
    "They send him to Iraq.": 3,
    " Two years ago, after having served four years in the United States Marine Corps and deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan, I found myself in Port-au-Prince, leading a team of veterans and medical professionals": 1,
    " in some of the hardest hit areas of that city three days after the earthquake.": 1,
    "We were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go, the places nobody else could go.": 1,
    "And after three weeks, we realized something.": 1,
    " Military veterans are very, very good at disaster response.": 1,
    "And coming home, my co-founder and I, we looked at it and we said, there are two problems.": 1,
    " The first problem is this inadequate disaster response.": 1,
    "It's slow, it's antiquated, it's not using the best technology, and it's not using the best people.": 1,
    " The second problem that we became aware of was a very inadequate veteran reintegration.": 1,
    "And this is a topic that is front page news right now, is veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan and they're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life.": 1,
    " And we sat here and we looked at these two problems and finally we came to a realization.": 1,
    "These aren't problems, these are actually solutions.": 1,
    "And what do I mean by that?": 1,
    " Well, we can use disaster response as an opportunity for service for the veterans coming home.": 1,
    "Recent surveys show that 92% of veterans want to continue their service when they take off their uniform.": 1,
    "And we can use veterans to improve disaster response.": 1,
    " Now, on the surface, this makes a lot of sense.": 1,
    "And in 2010, we responded to the tsunami in Chile, the floods in Pakistan.": 1,
    "We sent training teams to the Thai-Burma border.": 1,
    "But it was earlier this year.": 1,
    " When one of our original members caused us to shift focus in the organization, this is Clay Hunt.": 1,
    "Clay was a Marine with me.": 1,
    "We served together in Iraq and Afghanistan.": 1,
    "Clay was with us in Port-au-Prince.": 1,
    "He was also with us in Chile.": 1,
    " Earlier this year in March, Clay took his own life.": 1,
    "This was a tragedy, but it really forced us": 1,
    " to refocus what it is that we were doing.": 1,
    "You know, Clay didn't kill himself because what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan.": 1,
    "Clay killed himself because of what he lost when he came home.": 1,
    "He lost purpose.": 1,
    "He lost his community.": 1,
    " Perhaps most tragically, he lost his self-worth.": 1,
    " And so as we evaluated and as the dust settled from this tragedy, we realized that of those two problems, in the initial iteration of our organization, we are a disaster response organization that was using veteran service.": 1,
    " We had a lot of success and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm.": 1,
    "But after Clay, we shifted that focus.": 1,
    "And suddenly, now moving forward, we see ourselves as a veteran service organization that's using disaster response.": 1,
    " Because we think that we can give that purpose and that community and that self-worth back to the veteran.": 1,
    "And tornadoes in Tuscaloosa and Joplin and then later Hurricane Irene gave us an opportunity to look at that.": 1,
    " Now, I want you to imagine for a second an 18-year-old boy who graduates from high school in Kansas City, Missouri.": 1,
    "Every day, he leaves the wire with a mission.": 1,
    " That mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home.": 1,
    "It's to keep the men around him alive.": 1,
    "It's to pacify the village that he works in.": 1,
    "He's got a purpose, but he comes home from Kansas City, Missouri.": 1,
    "Maybe he goes to college.": 1,
    "Maybe he's got a job.": 1,
    " But he doesn't have that same sense of purpose.": 1,
    "You give him a chainsaw, you send him to Joplin, Missouri after a tornado.": 1,
    "He regains that.": 1,
    " Going back, that same 18-year-old boy, he graduates from high school in Kansas City, Missouri.": 1,
    " Every day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him.": 1,
    "He leaves the wire.": 1,
    "He knows that those people have his back.": 1,
    "He slept in the same sand.": 1,
    "They've lived together.": 1,
    "They've eaten together.": 1,
    "They've bled together.": 1,
    "He goes home to Kansas City, Missouri.": 1,
    " He gets out of the military, he takes his uniform off.": 1,
    "He doesn't have that community anymore.": 1,
    "But you drop 25 of those veterans in Joplin, Missouri, they get that sense of community back.": 1,
    " Again, you have an 18-year-old boy who graduates high school in Kansas City.": 1,
    " They pin a medal on his chest, he goes home to a ticker tape parade.": 1,
    " He takes the uniform off.": 1,
    "He's no longer Sergeant Jones in his community.": 1,
    "He's now Dave from Kansas City.": 1,
    "He doesn't have that same self-worth.": 1,
    "But you send him to Joplin after a tornado and somebody once again is walking up to him and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service.": 1,
    " now they have self-worth again.": 1,
    "I think it's very important because right now somebody needs to step up and this generation of veterans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
