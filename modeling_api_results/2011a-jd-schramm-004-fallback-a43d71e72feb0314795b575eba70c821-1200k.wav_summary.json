    " From all outward appearances, John had everything going for him.": 1,
    " He had just signed the contract to sell his New York apartment at a six-figure profit, and he'd only owned it for five years.": 1,
    " The school where he graduated from with his masters had just offered him a teaching appointment, which meant not only a salary, but benefits for the first time in ages.": 1,
    " And yet despite everything going really well for John, he was struggling, fighting addiction and a gripping depression.": 1,
    " On the night of June 11, 2003, he climbed up to the edge of the fence on the Manhattan Bridge and he leapt to the treacherous waters below.": 1,
    " Remarkably, no miraculously, he lived.": 1,
    " The fall shattered his right arm, broke every rib that he had, punctured his lung, and he drifted in and out of consciousness as he drifted down the East River.": 1,
    " under the Brooklyn Bridge and out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry.": 1,
    " where passengers on the ferry heard his cries of pain, contacted the boats captain who contacted the coast guard who fished him out of the East River and took him to Bellevue Hospital.": 1,
    " That's actually where our story begins, because once John committed himself to putting his life back together, first physically, then emotionally, and then spiritually,": 1,
    " He found that there were very few resources available to someone who has attempted to end their life in the way that he did.": 1,
    " Research shows that 19 out of 20 people who attempt suicide will fail.": 1,
    " But the people who fail are 37 times more likely to succeed the second time.": 1,
    " This truly is an at-risk population with very few resources to support them.": 1,
    " And what happens when people try to assemble themselves back into life, because of our taboos around suicide, we're not sure what to say, and so quite often we say nothing.": 1,
    " And that furthers the isolation that people like John found themselves in.": 1,
    " I know John's story very well because I'm John.": 1,
    " And this is today the first time in any sort of public setting I've ever acknowledged the journey that I have been on.": 1,
    " But after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006 and a good friend last year to suicide,": 1,
    " And sitting last year at Ted Active, I knew that I needed to step out of my silence and pass my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading.": 1,
    " And that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help.": 1,
    " As the Trevor Project says, it gets better.": 1,
    "It gets way better.": 1,
    " And I'm choosing to come out of a totally different kind of closet today to encourage you, to urge you.": 1,
    " that if you are someone who has contemplated or attempted suicide or you know somebody who has, talk about it.": 1,
    " get help.": 1,
    "It's a conversation worth having and an idea worth spreading.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
