    " Yeah.": 2,
    " About 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong.": 1,
    " And at the time, I was very superstitious.": 1,
    "So upon landing, this was still at the old Hong Kong airport at Kai Tak when it was smack in the middle of the city.": 1,
    " I thought, if I see something good, I'm going to have a great time here in my two weeks.": 1,
    "And if I see something negative,": 1,
    " I'm going to be miserable indeed.": 1,
    "So the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard.": 1,
    " and I actually went to see some other design companies in Hong Kong in my studio and it turned out that": 1,
    " I just went to see what they are doing in Hong Kong.": 1,
    "But I actually walked away with a great job offer and I flew back to Austria, packed my bags and": 1,
    " Another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong, still superstitious, and thinking, well, if that winner billboard is still up, I'm going to have a good time working here.": 1,
    " But if it's gone, it's going to be really miserable and stressful.": 1,
    " So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up, but they had put this one right next to it.": 1,
    " On the other hand, it also taught me where superstition gets me because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong.": 1,
    " However, I did have": 1,
    " number of real moments of happiness in my life of you know I think what's the conference brochure": 1,
    " refers to as moments that take your breath away.": 1,
    "And since I'm a big list maker, I actually listed them all.": 1,
    " Now you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them and I won't read them for you.": 1,
    "I know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses.": 1,
    " What I did do though...": 1,
    " is I actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design.": 1,
    " And very surprisingly, over half of them had actually something to do with this design.": 1,
    " So there's of course two different possibilities.": 1,
    "There's one from a consumer's point of view where I was happy while experiencing design.": 1,
    "And I'll just give you one example.": 1,
    "I had gotten my first Walkman.": 1,
    "This is 1983.": 1,
    " My brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle that he was willing to borrow to me freely.": 1,
    "And the police's synchronicity cassette has just been released.": 1,
    " And there was no helmet law in my hometown of Braggans, so you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting the police on the new Sony Walkman.": 1,
    " I remember it as a true moment of happiness.": 1,
    "Of course they are related to this combination of at least two of them being design objects.": 1,
    " and you know there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be you know situated somewhere here right in there between delight and bliss.": 1,
    "Now there is the": 1,
    " Other part from a designer's standpoint, if you're happy while actually doing it,": 1,
    " And one way to see how happy designers are when you're designing could be to look at the author's photos on the back of their monographs.": 1,
    " So according to this, the Australians and the Japanese as well as the Mexicans are very happy, while somewhat the Spaniards and I think particularly the Swiss": 1,
    " Don't be doing all that well.": 1,
    " Laughter.": 1,
    " Last November, a museum opened in Tokyo called the Mori Museum in a skyscraper up on the 56th floor and their inaugural exhibit was called Happiness.": 1,
    " And I went very eagerly to see because, well, also with an eye on this conference.": 1,
    "And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different": 1,
    " areas under Arcadia, they showed things like this from the Edo period, a hundred ways to write happiness in different forms.": 1,
    " Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono that, of course, later on was made into the label for the Beatles.": 1,
    " Under Nirvana, they showed this constable painting.": 1,
    "And there's an interesting theory about abstraction.": 1,
    " Blue Field is actually an Yves Klein painting and the theory was that if you abstract an image you really open as much room for the unrepresentable and therefore": 1,
    " you know, are able to involve the viewer more than under desire.": 1,
    "They showed these show paintings also from the Edo period and consult.": 1,
    " And lastly, on the harmony, they had this 13th century mandala from Tibet.": 1,
    " Now what I took away from the exhibit was that maybe there's the exception of the mandala.": 1,
    " Most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness.": 1,
    " And I felt a little bit cheated because the visualization, that's a really easy thing to do.": 1,
    "And my studio, we've done it all the time.": 1,
    " a book, a happy dog, and you take it out.": 1,
    "It's an aggressive dog.": 1,
    "It's a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne.": 1,
    " or a chess poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face.": 1,
    "You know, that's not a big deal to accomplish.": 1,
    " it's gotten to the point where within advertising or within the movie industry, Happy has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually": 1,
    " want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic, you almost would have to, you know, do it from a cynical point of view.": 1,
    " the movie poster or we a couple of weeks ago designed a box set for the talking heads where the happiness": 1,
    " visualized on the cover definitely has very much a dark side to it.": 1,
    " much much more difficult is this where the designs actually can": 1,
    " evoke happiness, and I'm gonna just show you three that actually did this for me.": 1,
    " This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York who calls himself True.": 1,
    "Everybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be familiar with these signs.": 1,
    " printed his own version of these signs, met every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends.": 1,
    "They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version.": 1,
    " So this is one.": 1,
    " Now the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs.": 1,
    " You're really bored in the subway, and you kind of stare at something, and it takes you a while until you actually realize that this says something different than what it normally says.": 1,
    " I mean that's at least how it made me happy.": 1,
    " LAUGHTER": 1,
    " Now, True is a real humanitarian.": 1,
    "He didn't want any of his friends to be arrested.": 1,
    "So he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card.": 1,
    " and also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody, sort of like pretending that it's an art project financed by the Metropolitan Transit Authority.": 1,
    " Another New York project, this is at PS1, a sculpture that's basically a square room by James Thorell that has a retractable": 1,
    " ceiling opens up at dusk and dawn every day.": 1,
    "You don't see the horizon.": 1,
    "You're just in there watching the incredible subtle changes of color in the sky.": 1,
    " And the room is truly something to be seen.": 1,
    "People's demeanor changes when they go in there and for sure I haven't looked.": 1,
    " at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there.": 1,
    "There, of course, more than those three projects that I'm showing here,": 1,
    " I would definitely say that observing Vic Muniz's cloud a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy as well.": 1,
    " And then, but my last project is again from a young designer from in New York.": 1,
    "He's from Korea originally, and he took it upon himself to print.": 1,
    " 55,000 empty speech bubbles, stickers, large ones and small ones, and he goes around New York and just puts them empty as they are on posters.": 1,
    " and other people go and fill them in.": 1,
    " This one says, please let me die in peace.": 1,
    " I think that was the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good.": 1,
    " on a musician poster that says, I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than 200,000 units, and that as a result, my recoupable advance from my label will be taken from me, after which my contract will be cancelled.": 1,
    " and I'll be back doing journey covers on Bleecker Street.": 1,
    " I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins.": 1,
    "She gets to have his project, the public gets a...": 1,
    " sweeter environment, a different public gets a place to express themselves, and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads.": 1,
    " Well, there was a question, of course, that was on my mind for a while.": 1,
    " Can I do more of the things that I like doing in design and less of the ones that I don't like to be doing?": 1,
    " brought me back to my list making, you know, just to see what I actually like about my job.": 1,
    " You know, one is just working without pressure, then looking concentrated without being frazzled or, as Nancy said before, like really immersed.": 1,
    " oneself into it, trying not to get stuck doing the same thing or trying not to get stuck behind the computer all day.": 1,
    "This is related to it, getting out of the studio.": 1,
    " then of course trying to work on things where the content is actually important for me and being able to enjoy the end results.": 1,
    " And then I found another list in one of my diaries.": 1,
    " that actually contained all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far.": 1,
    " Just about at that time an Austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads, design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine.": 1,
    " And the whole thing just fell together.": 1,
    "So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned.": 1,
    "In this case, everything I do always comes back to me.": 1,
    "And we made these breads right out of this.": 1,
    " So it was everything I do always comes back to me.": 1,
    " couple of weeks ago": 1,
    " French company asked us to design five billboards for them.": 1,
    "Again, we could supply the content for it.": 1,
    "So I just picked another one, and this was two weeks ago.": 1,
    "We flew to Arizona.": 1,
    " the designer who works with me and myself, and photographed this one.": 1,
    "So it's trying to look good, limits.": 1,
    " my life.": 1,
    "And then we did one more of these.": 1,
    " This is again for a magazine dividing pages.": 1,
    " This is having.": 1,
    "This is the same thing.": 1,
    "It's just photographed from the side.": 1,
    "This is from the front.": 1,
    "Then it's guts.": 1,
    "Again, it's the same thing.": 1,
    "Guts is just the same room reworked.": 1,
    " then it's always...": 1,
    " Works out.": 1,
    " then it's four with the light on.": 1,
    " And it's me.": 1,
    " Thank you so much.": 1
