    "As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this.": 1,
    "We are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island near the town of Southampton in New York.": 1,
    " When I was a little girl, my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day.": 1,
    "There were no clouds in the sky.": 1,
    " And after a while, I began to perspire.": 1,
    " And he pointed up to the sky and he said, look, do you see that?": 1,
    "That's part of you up there.": 1,
    "That's your water that helps to make the cloud, that becomes the rain.": 1,
    " that feeds the plants, that feeds the animals.": 1,
    " In my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life, I started storm chasing in 2008 after my daughter said, Mom, you should do that.": 1,

    " Storm chasing is a very tactile experience.": 1,
    "There's a warm, moist wind blowing at your back, and the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged particles,": 1,

    " I've learned to respect the lightning.": 1,
    "My hair used to be straight.": 1,
    " I'm just kidding.": 1,
    " What really excites me about these storms is their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds.": 1,
    "They become lovely monsters.": 1,
    " When I'm photographing them, I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson.": 1,
    " As I stand under them, I see not just a cloud, but understand that what I have the privilege to witness is the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version that helped to create our galaxy,": 1,
