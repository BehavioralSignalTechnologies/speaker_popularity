    " Okay?": 4,
    "Okay.": 4,
    "Thanks.": 2,
    " Thank you.": 2,
    "Yeah?": 2,
    "Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.": 2,
    "Okay?": 2,
    " So.": 2,
    "Let's see here.": 2,
    " I started juggling a long time ago, but long before that I was a golfer.": 1,
    "And that's what I was, a golfer.": 1,
    " As a golfer and as a kid, one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores that I sort of lived my whole life is process.": 1,
    "And it's the process of learning things.": 1,
    "One of the great things was my father was an avid golfer, but he was a lefty.": 1,
    " And he had a real passion for golf and he also created this whole mythology about Ben Hogan and various things.": 1,
    "Well, I learned a lot about interesting things that I knew nothing about at the time but grew to know stuff about.": 1,
    " And that was the mythology of skill.": 1,
    "And so one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill.": 1,
    "And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music,": 1,
    " I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Todd Macover with the MIT Media Lab.": 1,
    "It relates a lot to music.": 1,
    "But Todd couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere.": 1,
    "I'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought or not.": 1,
    "But I'm going to explore skill and": 1,
    " and juggling and": 1,
    " Basically,": 1,
    " Visual music, I guess.": 1,
    "OK, you can start the music.": 1,
    "Now juggling can be a lot of fun.": 1,
    " play, play with skill, and play with space, play with rhythm.": 1,
    "You can turn the mic on now.": 1,
    "I'm going to do a couple of pieces.": 1,
    "I do a big piece in a triangle, and these are three sections from it.": 1,
    " Part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands, because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented, but using the rhythm of my body and feet and controlling the balls with my feet.": 1,
    " This next section was an attempt to explore space.": 1,
    "See, I think Richard said something about people that are against something.": 1,
    "Well, a lot of people think jugglers": 1,
    " defy gravity or do stuff.": 1,
    "Well, I kind of, from my childhood at golf and all that, it's a process of joining with forces.": 1,
    "And so what I like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique.": 1,
    "So juggling, gravity.": 1,
    " Up, down.": 1,
    "Well, if you figure out what up and down really are,": 1,
    " It's a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down up and everything.": 1,
    "But then you add in sideways.": 1,
    " Now, I look at it somewhat as a way, when you learn juggling, what you learn is how to feel with your eyes and see with your hands.": 1,
    "Because you're not looking at your hands, you're looking at where the balls are, you're looking at the audience.": 1,
    " So this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm.": 1,
    " with the obvious reference to the feet, but it's also time, where the feet were, where the balls were.": 1,
    " So visual, music, rhythm, and complexity.": 1,
    "I'm going to build towards complexity now.": 1,
    "Juggling three balls is simple and normal.": 1,
    " Well, excuse me.": 1,
    " For jugglers, OK?": 1,
    "And remember, you're transposing.": 1,
    "You're getting into a subculture here.": 1,
    " And juggling the balls cross and all that.": 1,
    "OK, if you keep them in their assigned paths, you've got parallel lines of different heights, but in hopefully even rhythm.": 1,
    "Then you can change the rhythm.": 1,
    "Good, Michael.": 1,
    " You can change the rhythm if you get out of the lights.": 1,
    "Change the rhythm so it's even.": 1,
    " Or you can go back.": 1,
    " and change the height.": 1,
    "Now, skill.": 1,
    "Well, but you're boxed in if you can only do it up and down that way.": 1,
    "So, you gotta go after the space down there.": 1,
    " Okay, then you're going to combine them because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you.": 1,
    " And then you get crazy.": 1,
    " Now, I'm actually going to ask you to try something, so you got to pay attention.": 1,
    "Complexity.": 1,
    " If you spend enough time doing something, time slows down or your skill increases so your perceptions change.": 1,
    "It's learning skills like being in a high-speed car crash.": 1,
    " Things slow down as you learn, as you learn, as you learn.": 1,
    "You may not be able to affect it.": 1,
    "It almost drifts on you and goes.": 1,
    "But that's the closest approximation I can have to it.": 1,
    "So, complexity.": 1,
    "Now, how many here are jugglers?": 1,
    " Okay, so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this.": 1,
    "And whoever laughed there had to say it.": 1,
    "Yeah.": 1,
    "You understood it completely, right?": 1,
    "No.": 1,
    " It looks like a mess.": 1,
    "It looks like a mess with a guy there who's got his hands around that mess.": 1,
    "OK?": 1,
    "Well, that's what juggling is about, right?": 1,
    "Is being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand.": 1,
    "All right, so that's one way of doing it, which is five balls down.": 1,
    " Okay, another way is the outside.": 1,
    " And you can play with the rhythm.": 1,
    " Same pattern.": 1,
    " Make it faster and smaller.": 1,
    " Make it wider.": 1,
    " Okay, thanks.": 1,
    " Yeah.": 1,
    " Now, what I wanted to get to is that you're all very bright, very tactile.": 1,
    "I have no idea how computer-oriented or three-dimensionally-oriented you are, but let's try something.": 1,
    "Okay, so since you all": 1,
    " Don't understand what the five ball pattern is.": 1,
    "I'm going to give you a little clue.": 1,
    " Is this a clue?": 1,
    " So you get the pattern, right?": 1,
    " No, no, no, you're not getting off that easy.": 1,
    "All right?": 1,
    " Now do me a favor.": 1,
    "Follow the ball that I ask you to follow.": 1,
    "Green.": 1,
    " Okay.": 1,
    "You can do that?": 1,
    "Now let's actually learn something.": 1,
    "Or actually, let me put you in that area of learning which is very insecure.": 1,
    "You want to do it?": 1,
    " Hands out in front of you.": 1,
    " Thumbs up.": 1,
    " What you're going to learn is this.": 1,
    "So what I want you to do, just listen to me and do it.": 1,
    "Index finger, middle finger, ring, little.": 1,
    "Little, ring, middle, index.": 1,
    "And then open.": 1,
    "Finger, finger.": 1,
    " Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.": 1,
    "A little bit faster.": 1,
    "Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.": 1,
    " Alright, a lot of different learning processes going on in here.": 1,
    " One learning process that I see is this.": 1,
    " Another learning process that I see is this.": 1,
    " Okay, so everybody take a breath, breath in, breath out.": 1,
    "Okay, now, one more time.": 1,
    " Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.": 1,
    "Open.": 1,
    "Okay, shake your hands up.": 1,
    " Now, I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer, okay?": 1,
    "So what you're doing is you're going, la la la, and you're getting this, okay?": 1,
    "So that's exactly what I'm going to ask you to do, but in a slightly different way.": 1,
    "You've got to combine it.": 1,
    " So what I want you to do is fingers.": 1,
    "I'll tell you what to do with your fingers, same thing.": 1,
    "But what I want you to do is also with your eyes follow the color ball that I ask you to follow.": 1,
    "Here we go.": 1,
    "So we're going to start off looking at the white ball, and I'm going to tell you which color, and I'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers.": 1,
    "So, white ball.": 1,
    " And finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, pink.": 1,
    "Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, green.": 1,
    "Finger, finger, finger, finger, yellow.": 1,
    "Finger, finger,": 1,
    " finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.": 1,
    "All right.": 1,
    " How'd you do?": 1,
    " Well, okay.": 1,
    "The reason I wanted you to do this is because that's actually what most people face throughout their lives.": 1,
    "A moment of learning.": 1,
    "A moment of challenge.": 1,
    "It's a moment that you can't make sense of.": 1,
    "Why the hell should I learn this?": 1,
    " Does it really have anything to do with anything in my life?": 1,
    "I can't decipher.": 1,
    "Is it fun?": 1,
    "Is it challenging?": 1,
    "Am I supposed to cheat?": 1,
    " What are you supposed to do?": 1,
    "You've got somebody up here who's the operative principle of doing that for his whole life.": 1,
    " OK, trying to figure that stuff out.": 1,
    "But is it going to get you anywhere?": 1,
    "It's just a moment.": 1,
    "That's all it is, a moment.": 1,
    "OK, I'm going to change the script for one second.": 1,
    "Just let me do this.": 1,
    "I don't need music for it.": 1,
    "Talking about time in a moment is a piece that I recently developed.": 1,
    " which is all about that, a moment.": 1,
    "And what I do as a creative artist is I develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects.": 1,
    "What I've done for you here": 1,
    " I developed a lot of those tricks, whatever, and I put the choreography together, but they're not original techniques.": 1,
    "Now I'm going to start showing you some original techniques that come from the work that I've developed.": 1,
    "So a moment.": 1,
    "How would you define a moment?": 1,
    "Well, as a juggler,": 1,
    " What I wanted to do...": 1,
    " was create something that was representational.": 1,
    " Have a moment.": 1,
    " I'll use that in a minute.": 1,
    "All right, I'm going to get on my knees and do it.": 1,
    "So, a moment.": 1,
    " OK?": 1,
    "And what I did as a juggler was say, OK, what can I do to make that something that is dependent on something else?": 1,
    "Another dynamic.": 1,
    " A moment.": 1,
    " moment.": 1,
    " Excuse me, slow study in here.": 1,
    "A moment to travel.": 1,
    " a moment and try that again.": 1,
    " that separates and comes back together.": 1,
    "Time.": 1,
    "How can you look at time?": 1,
    "And what are you dedicated to in exploring a particular thing?": 1,
    "Well, obviously,": 1,
    " There's something in here, and you can all have a guess as to what it is.": 1,
    "There's a mystery.": 1,
    "There's a mystery in the moment, and it has to settle.": 1,
    "And then it's dependent on something else.": 1,
    " And that comes to rest.": 1,
    " Just a little thing about time.": 1,
    "Now this is expanded into a much bigger piece where I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on while I'm keeping time with this.": 1,
    "But I just thought I'd talk about a moment.": 1,
    " All right.": 1,
    " Okay, can we show the video of the triangle?": 1,
    "Are we ready to do that?": 1,
    "Yes?": 1,
    "This is the piece that I told you about.": 1,
    "It's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle.": 1,
    " The only thing I'll say about the last session is...": 1,
    " You ever tried juggling and driving the car with your knees at 120 miles an hour?": 1,
    " The only other thing is it was a real shock.": 1,
    "I always drove motorcycles.": 1,
    "And when I bought my first car, it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents' house.": 1,
    " Interesting.": 1,
    "Anyway, balance.": 1,
    " Constant movement.": 1,
    " to find an approach to stillness.": 1,
    " Cheating.": 1,
    " balance.": 1,
    " Making up the rules so you can't cheat.": 1,
    " So you learn.": 1,
    " to flying, to approach stillness with different parts of your body.": 1,
    " to have a conversation with it.": 1,
    " to speak.": 1,
    " listen.": 1,
    " Now, it's dependent on rhythm.": 1,
    " And...": 1,
    " keeping the center of balance when it falls, going underneath it.": 1,
    "So there's a rhythm to it.": 1,
    " The rhythm.": 1,
    " can't get much smaller.": 1,
    " as your skill increases.": 1,
    "You learn to find those tinier spaces.": 1,
    " those tinier movements.": 1,
    " Now I'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece.": 1,
    " that": 1,
    " is about balance, in some ways, and also, oh, actually,": 1,
    " If you're bored, not here.": 1,
    " Here's one used for it.": 1,
    " You can go with the Styx One music.": 1,
    " Thanks.": 1,
    "That has a certain kind of balance to it, which is all about plumb.": 1,
    "I apprenticed to a carpenter.": 1,
    " and learned about plumb square and level.": 1,
    "And they influenced that and this next piece, which I'll do a little segment of.": 1,
    "Two sticks, you can go with it.": 1,
    " which is again exploring space and the lines in space.": 1,
    " Working with space.": 1,
    " and the lines in space.": 1,
    " in a different way.": 1,
    " I'll come back to that in a second, but working with one ball.": 1,
    "Now what if you attach something to it or change it?": 1,
    " This is just a little thing that I made.": 1,
    "Because I really like the idea of curves and balls together.": 1,
    " And then.": 1,
    " creating space and the rhythm of space.": 1,
    " using the surface of the balls, surface of the arms.": 1,
    "Just a little toy.": 1,
    " Which leads me to the next thing, which is...": 1,
    " What do I got here?": 1,
    " Alright.": 1,
    " I'm actually leading up to something, the newest thing that I'm working on.": 1,
    "This is not it.": 1,
    "This is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape.": 1,
    " And what I just did was I worked with the mathematics, the diameter and the circumference.": 1,
    " Sometimes pieces are mathematical in that way that I look at a shape and say, what about if I use this and this and this?": 1,
    " What happens in life affects my choice of objects that I try to work with.": 1,
    "The next piece that I'm going to do, which is the cylinders piece, if you want to get that up.": 1,
    " It has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago, which were": 1,
    " stone with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs.": 1,
    "I love ceramics and all that.": 1,
    "It's a combination of that, the beauty of that, the shape and": 1,
    " the stories that were involved in it, as well as the fact that they protected the contents.": 1,
    " The second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness.": 1,
    " So if you want to go with the music for cylinders.": 1,
    " Talking about geometry and everything.": 1,
    " If you take": 1,
    " the circle, and you split it in half.": 1,
    "Can you run S-curve music?": 1,
    "I'm going to do just a short version of it.": 1,
    " Circles split in half and rotated.": 1,
    " and mythology.": 1,
    " Anyway, that piece.": 1,
    " Also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it I dance around.": 1,
    "Small stage though.": 1,
    "Two minutes just to end.": 1,
    "The latest piece that I'm working on.": 1,
    "What I love is that I never know what I'm working on, why I'm working on it.": 1,
    "They're not ideas, they're instincts.": 1,
    " And the latest thing that I'm working on": 1,
    " to something really...": 1,
    " I don't know what it is yet.": 1,
    " And that's good.": 1,
    " I'd like not to know for as long as possible.": 1,
    " Well, because then it tells me the truth instead of me imposing the truth.": 1,
    " And what it is is working with both positive and negative space, but also with these curves.": 1,
    " And what it involves, and I don't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not, but I'll do a little bit of it.": 1,
    "It initially started off with me stacking these things, bunches of them, and then playing with the sense of space.": 1,
    " of filling in the space.": 1,
    " And then it started chaining.": 1,
    " and become folding on themselves.": 1,
    " And then changing levels.": 1,
    " Because my attempt is to make visual instruments.": 1,
    " Not to just make, now I'll try one other thing.": 1,
    " to work in three dimensions with your perceptions of space and time.": 1,
    "Now I don't know exactly where it's going, but I've got a bit of effort involved in this thing, and it's going to change as I go through it.": 1,
    " but I really like it.": 1,
    "Feels right.": 1,
    "This may not be the right shape, and I have, look at this shape, and then I'll show you the last, the first design I ever put to it.": 1,
    " Just to see, just to play, because I love all different kinds of things to play with.": 1,
    "To work with the positive and negative in a different way.": 1,
    " and to change and to change.": 1,
    "So I'm off on my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space.": 1,
    "We'll see what I come up with.": 1,
    "Thanks for having me.": 1
