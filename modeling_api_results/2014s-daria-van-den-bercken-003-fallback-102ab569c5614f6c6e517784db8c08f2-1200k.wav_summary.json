    " Recently I flew over a crowd of thousands of people in Brazil, playing music by George Frederick Handel.": 1,
    "I also drove along the streets of Amsterdam, again playing music by this same composer.": 1,
    " Let's take a look.": 1,
    " And it's there, on the third floor.": 1,
    "I live there, on the roof.": 1,
    "I live here where the roof comes from, and you're welcome.": 1,
    "Are you having fun?": 1,
    "Yes!": 1,
    " All this was a real magical experience for hundreds of reasons.": 1,
    "Now you may ask, why have I done these things?": 1,
    "They're not really typical for a musician's day-to-day life.": 1,
    " Well, I did it because I fell in love with the music and I wanted to share it with as many people as possible.": 1,
    " It started a couple of years ago.": 1,
    "I was sitting at home on the couch with the flu and browsing the internet a little when I found out that Handel had written works for the keyboard.": 1,
    " Well, I was surprised.": 1,
    "I did not know this.": 1,
    "So I downloaded the sheet music and started playing.": 1,
    " And what happened next was that I entered the state of pure, unprejudiced amazement.": 1,
    " It was an experience of being totally in awe of the music.": 1,
    "And I had not felt that in a long time.": 1,
    " it might be easier to relate to this when you hear it.": 1,
    "The first piece that I played through started like this.": 1,
    " Well, this sounds very melancholic, doesn't it?": 1,
    "And I turned the page, and what came next was this.": 1,
    " Well, this sounds very energetic, doesn't it?": 1,
    "So, within a couple of minutes, and the piece isn't even finished yet, I experience two very contrasting characters.": 1,
    " beautiful melancholy and sheer energy.": 1,
    "And I consider these two elements to be vital human expressions.": 1,
    "And the purity of the music makes you hear it very effectively.": 1,
    " I've given a lot of children's concerts for children of seven and eight year olds.": 1,
    "And whatever I play, whether it's Bach, Beethoven, even Stockhausen, or some jazzy music,": 1,
    " They are open to hear it, really willing to listen, and they are comfortable doing so.": 1,
    "And when classes come in with children who are just a few years older, 11, 12,": 1,
    " I felt that I sometimes already had trouble in reaching them like that.": 1,
    "The complexity of the music does become an issue.": 1,
    " actually the opinions of others, parents, friends, media, they start to count.": 1,
    " but the young ones they don't question their own opinion.": 1,
    " They are in this constant state of wonder.": 1,
    "And I do firmly believe that we can keep listening like these seven-year-old children, even when growing up.": 1,
    " And that is why I have played not only in the concert hall, but also on the street, online, in the air, to feel that state of wonder, to truly listen.": 1,
    " and to listen without prejudice.": 1,
    "And I'd like to invite you to do so now.": 1,
    " you you": 1
