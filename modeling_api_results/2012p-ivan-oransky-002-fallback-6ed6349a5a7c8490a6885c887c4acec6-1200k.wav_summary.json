    " Those of you who have seen the film Moneyball or read the book by Michael Lewis will be familiar with the story of Billy Beane.": 1,
    " Billy was supposed to be a tremendous ballplayer.": 1,
    "All the scouts told him so.": 1,
    "They told his parents that.": 1,
    "They predicted that he was going to be a star.": 1,
    " But what actually happened when he signed a contract, and by the way, he didn't want to sign that contract, he wanted to go to college, which is what my mother, who actually does love me, said that I should do too, and I did.": 1,
    " Well, he didn't do very well.": 1,
    "He struggled mightily.": 1,
    "He got traded a couple times, he ended up in the miners for most of his career, and he actually ended up in management.": 1,
    "He ended up as a general manager of the Oakland A's.": 1,
    " Now, for many of you in this room, ending up in management, which is also what I've done, is seen as a success.": 1,
    "I can assure you that for a kid trying to make it in the bigs,": 1,
    " Going into management ain't no success, sorry.": 1,
    "It's a failure.": 1,
    "And what I want to talk to you about today and share with you is that our healthcare system, our medical system, is just as bad at predicting": 1,
    " what happens to people in it, patients, others, as those scouts were at predicting what would happen to Billy Bean.": 1,
    " And yet, every day, thousands of people in this country are diagnosed with preconditions.": 1,
    "We hear about pre-hypertension, we hear about pre-dementia.": 1,
    " we hear about pre-anxiety, and I'm pretty sure that I diagnosed myself with that in the green room.": 1,
    " We also refer to subclinical conditions.": 1,
    "There's subclinical atherosclerosis, subclinical hardening of the arteries.": 1,
    " obviously linked to heart attacks potentially.": 1,
    "One of my favorites is called subclinical acne.": 1,
    "And if you look up subclinical acne, you may find a website, which I did, which says that this is the easiest type of acne to treat.": 1,
    " You don't have the pustules or the redness and inflammation.": 1,
    " Maybe that's because you don't actually have acne.": 1,
    " I have a name for all of these conditions.": 1,
    "It's another precondition.": 1,
    "I call them preposterous.": 1,
    " You know, in baseball": 1,
    " The game follows the pregame.": 1,
    "The season follows the preseason.": 1,
    " But with a lot of these conditions, that actually isn't the case, or at least it isn't the case all the time.": 1,
    "It's as if there's a rain delay every single time in many cases.": 1,
    "We have precancerous lesions.": 1,
    " which often don't turn into cancer.": 1,
    "And yet, if you take, for example, subclinical osteoporosis, a bone thinning disease precondition,": 1,
    " otherwise known as osteopenia, you would have to treat 270 women for three years in order to prevent one broken bone.": 1,
    " That's an awful lot of women when you multiply by the number of women who are diagnosed with this osteopenia.": 1,
    "And so is it any wonder, given all of the costs and the side effects of the drugs that we're using to treat these preconditions,": 1,
    " that every year we're spending more than $2 trillion on healthcare, and yet 100,000 people a year, and that's a conservative estimate, are dying not because of the conditions they have, but because of the treatments that we're giving them and the complications of those treatments.": 1,
    " We've medicalized everything in this country.": 1,
    "Women in the audience, I have some pretty bad news that you already know.": 1,
    "And that's that every aspect of your life has been medicalized.": 1,
    "Strike one is when you hit puberty.": 1,
    " You now have something that happens to you once a month that has been medicalized.": 1,
    "It's a condition.": 1,
    "It has to be treated.": 1,
    "Strike two is if you get pregnant.": 1,
    " That's been medicalized as well.": 1,
    "You have to have a high-tech experience of pregnancy, otherwise something might go wrong.": 1,
    "Strike three is menopause.": 1,
    " We all know what happened when millions of women were given hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms.": 1,
    " for decades until all of a sudden we realized, because a study came out, a big one, NIH funded, that said actually a lot of that hormone replacement therapy": 1,
    " maybe doing more harm than good for many of those women.": 1,
    "And just in case, I don't want to leave the men out.": 1,
    "I am one after all.": 1,
    " I have really bad news for all of you in this room and for everyone listening and watching elsewhere.": 1,
    "You all have a universally fatal condition.": 1,
    " So just take a moment.": 1,
    "It's called pre-death.": 1,
    " Every single one of you has it because you have the risk factor for it, which is being alive.": 1,
    " But I have some good news for you because I'm a journalist.": 1,
    "I like to end things in a happy way or a forward-thinking way.": 1,
    "And that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk, which we'll see if that happens for everyone,": 1,
    " you will be a pre-viver.": 1,
    " Now, I made up pre-death.": 1,
    " If I used someone else's pre-death, I apologize.": 1,
    "I think I made it up.": 1,
    "I didn't make up Proviver.": 1,
    "Proviver is what a particular cancer advocacy group would like everyone who just has a risk factor.": 1,
    " but hasn't actually had that cancer to call themselves.": 1,
    "You're a pre-vivor.": 1,
    " We've had HBO here this morning.": 1,
    "I'm wondering if Mark Burnett is anywhere in the audience.": 1,
    "I'd like to suggest a reality TV show called Previver.": 1,
    "If you develop a disease, you're off the island.": 1,
    " But the problem is we have a system that has completely, basically promoted this.": 1,
    "We've selected at every point in this system to do what we do and to give everyone a precondition and then eventually a condition in some cases.": 1,
    " for more information on": 1,
    " Start with a doctor-patient relationship.": 1,
    "Doctors, most of them, are in a fee-for-service system.": 1,
    "They are basically incentivized to do more procedures, tests.": 1,
    " prescribed medications.": 1,
    "Patients come to them, they want to do something.": 1,
    "We're Americans, we have to, we can't just stand there, we have to do something.": 1,
    " And so they want a drug, they want a treatment, they want to be told, this is what you have, this is how you treat it.": 1,
    "And if the doctor doesn't give you that,": 1,
    " you go somewhere else.": 1,
    "That's not very good for doctor's business.": 1,
    "Or even worse, if you are diagnosed with something eventually and the doctor didn't order that test,": 1,
    " you get sued.": 1,
    "We have pharmaceutical companies that are constantly trying to expand the indications, expand the number of people who are eligible for given": 1,
    " treatment because it obviously helps their bottom line.": 1,
    "We have advocacy groups, like the one that's come up with Previver, who want to make more and more people feel they're at risk or might have a condition so that they can raise more funds and raise visibility.": 1,
    " etc.": 1,
    "But this isn't actually, despite what journalists typically do, this isn't actually about blaming particular players.": 1,
    "We are all responsible.": 1,
    "I'm responsible.": 1,
    " I actually root for the Yankees.": 1,
    "I mean, talk about being sort of rooting for the worst possible offender when it comes to doing everything you can do.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " But everyone is responsible.": 1,
    "I went to medical school and I didn't have a course called How to Think Skeptically or How Not to Order Tests.": 1,
    " We have this sort of system where you know, that's what you do and it actually took being a journalist": 1,
    " to understand all these incentives.": 1,
    "Economists like to say, there are no bad people, there are just bad incentives.": 1,
    "And that's actually true.": 1,
    "Because what we've created is a sort of field of dreams when it comes to medical technology, right?": 1,
    " So, when you put another MRI in every corner, you put a robot in every hospital saying that everyone has to have robotic surgery, well, we've created a system where if you build it, they will come.": 1,
    " But you can actually perversely tell people to come, convince them that they have to come.": 1,
    " It was when I became a journalist that I really realized how I was part of this problem and how we all are part of this problem.": 1,
    "I was medicalizing every risk factor.": 1,
    "I was writing stories, commissioning stories.": 1,
    " every day that we're trying to sort of not necessarily make people worried, although that was what often happened.": 1,
    "But, you know, there are ways out.": 1,
    "I saw my own internist last week.": 1,
    " And he said to me, you know, and he told me something that everyone in this audience could have told me for free, but I paid him for the privilege, which is that I need to lose some weight.": 1,
    " Well, he's right.": 1,
    "I've had, honestly goodness, high blood pressure for a dozen years now, same age my father got it, and it's a real disease.": 1,
    "It's not pre-hypertension, it's actual hypertension, high blood pressure.": 1,
    "Well, he's right.": 1,
    " But he didn't say to me, well, you have pre-obesity, or you have free diabetes, or anything like that.": 1,
    "He didn't say, better start taking this statin.": 1,
    "You need to lower your cholesterol.": 1,
    " No, he said, go out and lose some weight, come back and see me in a bit, or just give me a call and let me know how you're doing.": 1,
    "So that's, to me, a way forward.": 1,
    "Billy Bean, by the way, learned the same thing.": 1,
    " He learned from watching this kid who he eventually hired, who was really successful for him, that it wasn't swinging for the fences.": 1,
    "It wasn't swinging at every pitch.": 1,
    " like the sluggers do, which is what all the expensive teams like the Yankees like to, they like to pick up those guys.": 1,
    "This kid told them, you know, you got to watch the guys and you got to go out and find the guys who like to walk.": 1,
    "Because getting on base by a walk": 1,
    " is just as good.": 1,
    "And in our healthcare system, we need to figure out, is that really a good pitch, or should we let it go by and not swing at everything?": 1,
    "Thanks.": 1
