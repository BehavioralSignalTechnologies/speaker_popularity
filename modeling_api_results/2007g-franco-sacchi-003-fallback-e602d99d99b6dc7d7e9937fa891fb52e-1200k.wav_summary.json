    "So...": 2,
    " I have a story, a story that I would like to share with you, and it's an African story.": 1,
    "It is a story of hope, resilience, and glamour.": 1,
    " There was Hollywood, then came Bollywood.": 1,
    "Today we have Nollywood, the third largest film industry in the world.": 1,
    " In 2006 alone, almost 2,000 films were made in Nigeria.": 1,
    "Now try to imagine": 1,
    " 40, 50 films wrapped, distributed every week in the streets of Lagos, Nigeria and West Africa.": 1,
    "Some estimate put": 1,
    " The value of this industry is 250 million dollars.": 1,
    "It has created thousands, if not tens of thousands of jobs.": 1,
    " and it's expanding.": 1,
    " But keep in mind that this was a grassroot movement.": 1,
    " This is something that happened without foreign investment, without government aid, and actually it happened against all odds.": 1,
    "And one of the most difficult": 1,
    " most difficult moment in Nigerian economy.": 1,
    "The industry is 15 years old.": 1,
    " And so maybe you're thinking now why, how an Italian filmmaker based in Boston is so interested in this story.": 1,
    " And so I think I have to tell you just a few words, a few things about my personal life and because I think there is a connection.": 1,
    " My grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in Zambia.": 1,
    "My father": 1,
    " also lived most of his adult life in East Africa, and I was born in Zambia.": 1,
    " Even though I left when I was only three years old, I really felt that Africa was this big part of my life.": 1,
    " And growing, it really was a place, a place where I learned to walk.": 1,
    "I think I huttered the first words and my family bought their first home.": 1,
    " When we came back to Italy, and one of the things that I remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories.": 1,
    " It seemed that for our neighbors and friends, Africa was either this exotic place, this imaginary land that probably exists only in their imagination,": 1,
    " And or the place of in horror famine and so we were always caught in this": 1,
    " stereotype and I remember really this desire to talk about Africa as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives and have dreams like we all have.": 1,
    "So when I": 1,
    " read in a newspaper in the business page the story of nollywood i really felt": 1,
    " this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against all these preconceived notions.": 1,
    "Here I can": 1,
    " tell a story of African-making movies like I do, and actually I felt this was an inspiration for me.": 1,
    " Ein.": 1,
    " I have the good fortune of being a filmmaker in residence at the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University.": 1,
    "And we really look how digital technology is changing and how young independent filmmakers can make movies at a fraction of the cost.": 1,
    " So when I proposed the story, I really had all the support to make this film.": 1,
    "And not only had the support, I found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure.": 1,
    "Amy Corrigan, a very talented young photographer,": 1,
    " and Robert Caputo, a friend and a mentor who": 1,
    " He's a veteran of National Geographic and told me, you know, Franco, in 25 years of covering Africa, I don't know if I have come across a story that is so full of hope and so fun.": 1,
    " we went to Lagos in October 2005.": 1,
    "And we went to Lagos to meet Banda Merua, a wonderful, talented film director who is with us tonight.": 1,
    " The plan was to give you a portrait of this incredible film industry.": 1,
    " Following bond in his quest to make an action movie to deal with the issue of corruption called checkpoint police corruption": 1,
    " and he had nine days to make it.": 1,
    "We felt this was a good story.": 1,
    "In the meantime, we had to cover Nollywood, and we talked to a lot of filmmakers.": 1,
    "But I don't want to create too many expectations.": 1,
    "I would like to show you six minutes": 1,
    " And these are six minutes that are really prepared for the TED audience.": 1,
    "There are several themes from the documentary, but they are re-edited and made for you.": 1,
    "So I guess it's a world premiere.": 1,
    " And action!": 1,
    " You can finance a movie with just $10,000 in Nigeria here.": 1,
    "And you shoot in seven days.": 1,
    " We're doing films for the masses.": 1,
    "We're not doing films for the elite and the people in their glass houses.": 1,
    "No, they can afford to watch their RoboCup and whatever.": 1,
    " I think filmmaking in Nigeria, for those involved in it, is a kind of subsistence filmmaking.": 1,
    "What they do to make a living.": 1,
    "It's not the fancy...": 1,
    " filmmaking where you say, oh, you want to put all the razzmatazz of Hollywood and where you have big budgets.": 1,
    "Here is that you make these films, it sells, you jump onto the location again to make another film.": 1,
    "Because if you don't make the next film, you're not going to fit.": 1,
    " So while we're entertaining we should be able to educate.": 1,
    " I believe in the power of audiovisuals.": 1,
    "I mean, 90% of the population watching Hollywood.": 1,
    "I think it's the most valuable vehicle right now to pass information across and to educate the people.": 1,
    " So if you're making a movie, no matter what your topic is, put a message in there.": 1,
    " I keep trying to explain to people it's not about the quality at the moment.": 1,
    "The quality is coming.": 1,
    "I mean there are those films that people are making for quality.": 1,
    " But the first thing you have to remember about this society is that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day, and these are the people that really watch these films.": 1,
    " Look at me.": 1,
    "Look at me.": 1,
    "I'm not too long.": 1,
    " Nollywood is a fantastic industry that has just been born in this part of the world.": 1,
    " Because nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa.": 1,
    " But our films, they are stories that our people can relate to themselves.": 1,
    "They are stories about our people, for our people.": 1,
    "And consistently, they are glued to their screen whenever they see this story.": 1,
    " and intrigues.": 1,
    "It's a blockbuster comedy to crack your": 1,
    " We have been": 1,
    " so deep into the foreign movies.": 1,
    "It's all about the foreign movies.": 1,
    "But we can do something too.": 1,
    "We can do something in fact, something that when the world sees it, they say, wow, this is Nigeria.": 1,
    " Don't embarrass yourself sergeant!": 1,
    "Don't embarrass yourself!": 1,
    " You can now walk the street and see your own model.": 1,
    "It's not just what you see in picture.": 1,
    "You see the person's life.": 1,
    "You see how he talks.": 1,
    "You see how he lives.": 1,
    " He influences you really good.": 1,
    "It's not just what you see in the picture.": 1,
    "It is not what you hear from the Western press.": 1,
    " I was so fascinated with those cowboy movies, but then when I discovered": 1,
    " the situation in my country at that time there was so much corruption for a young man to really make it out here you got to think of": 1,
    " some negative things and all that or some kind of vices.": 1,
    "And I didn't want that, you know, and I discovered that": 1,
    " I could be successful in life as an actor without doing crime, without cheating nobody, without telling all lies.": 1,
    "It's just me and God-given talent.": 1,
    " Let's go.": 1,
    "It's time to kick some ass.": 1,
    " Cover this idiot up!": 1,
    "Move it!": 1,
    " the countries when they do their movies they have all these things in place but here we improvise these items like the gunshots like the gun like here now you see the gun there but you won't see any gunshots we use knockout": 1,
    " That's why I use enough masking tape.": 1,
    "The masking tape will hold it.": 1,
    "Just hold it for me.": 1,
    " I'm just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it won't affect my face, the explosion, you know.": 1,
    "But she's a professional, she knows what she's doing.": 1,
    "I'm trying to protect my face too.": 1,
    "This ain't gonna be my last movie.": 1,
    " So now you're about to see how we do our own movies here, with or without any assistance from anybody.": 1,
    " Cut!": 1,
    " So many things to say, so little time, so many themes in this story.": 1,
    "I just can tell you, there's one thing I want to tell you.": 1,
    "I spent...": 1,
    " you know, several weeks with all these actors, producer, and the problem they have to go through are inimaginable for a filmmaker who works in America or in Europe, but always with a smile.": 1,
    " always with an enthusiasm that it's incredible.": 1,
    " to make movies like you need oxygen and i think they're breathing that the nigerian filmmakers really really are doing what they like and so": 1,
    " It's a very, very important thing for them and for their audiences.": 1,
    "A woman told me, when I see an Hollywood film, I can relax.": 1,
    "Really, I can breathe better.": 1,
    " There is also another very important thing that I hope will resonate with this audience.": 1,
    "It's technology.": 1,
    "I'm very interested in it.": 1,
    " I really think that digital non-linear editing, the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be.": 1,
    " Incredible cameras cost under $5,000, and this has unleashed tremendous energy.": 1,
    "And guess what?": 1,
    "We didn't have to tell them to the Nigerian filmmakers.": 1,
    "They understood it, they embraced the technology, and they run with it.": 1,
    "And they are successful.": 1,
    " I hope that this film will go, the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways.": 1,
    "I hope it will inspire other African nations to embrace the technology, look at the Nigerian model, make their film, create jobs, create a narrative": 1,
    " For the population something to identify something positive something that really is psychological relief and it's part of the culture but I really think this is a": 1,
    " a phenomenon that can inspire us.": 1,
    "I really think it goes both ways.": 1,
    "Filmmakers, friend of mine, they look at Nollywood and they say, wow, they're doing what we really want to do, make a buck and live with this job.": 1,
    "So I really think it's a lesson": 1,
    " and that we are actually learning from them.": 1,
    "And there is one thing, one small challenge for you, and should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling.": 1,
    "And I think this is really the theme of this session.": 1,
    " Try to imagine a world where the only goal is food.": 1,
    " and a shelter, but no stories, no stories around the campfire, no legends, no fairy tales.": 1,
    " Nothing.": 1,
    "No novels.": 1,
    " Difficult, eh?": 1,
    "It's meaningless.": 1,
    "So this is what I really think.": 1,
    "I think that the key to an healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers and I think that": 1,
    " the Nigerian filmmaker really have proved this.": 1,
    "I would like you to hear their voices just a few moments.": 1,
    "It's not an edited sequence, just some voices from": 1,
    " Nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them.": 1,
    "But if you have an industry that puts a smile on people's face, that's Nollywood.": 1,
    "I believe very soon we're not only going to have better movies, we'll have that original Nigerian movie.": 1,
    " It's still the same basic themes, love, action, but we are telling it our own way, our own Nigerian way, African way.": 1,
    " We have diverse cultures, diverse cultures.": 1,
    "That's so many.": 1,
    "That in the next ten lifetimes, I don't see us exhausting the stories we have.": 1,
    " My job ends here and the knowledge we filmmakers really have now to...": 1,
    " work and I really hope that there will be many, many collaborations where we teach each other things.": 1,
    "And I really hope that this will happen.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1,
    " I've got two questions.": 1,
    " Franco, you described this as the world's third largest film industry.": 1,
    "What does that translate to in terms of numbers of films?": 1,
    " Yes, I think I mentioned briefly but it's Close to 2,000 films there is scientific data on this": 1,
    " 2005 or 2006, the sensor board.": 1,
    " 1600 films alone, and we know that there are more.": 1,
    "So it's safe to say that there are 2000 films.": 1,
    "So imagine 45 films per week.": 1,
    " There are challenges, there are challenges.": 1,
    "There is a glut of film, the quality has to be raised, they need to go to the next level, but I'm optimistic.": 1,
    " And these aren't films that are primarily seen in cinemas?": 1,
    "Yes, of course.": 1,
    "This is very important.": 1,
    "These are films that are distributed directly in markets.": 1,
    " They are bought in video shops.": 1,
    "They can be rented for pennies.": 1,
    "On what format?": 1,
    "Thank you for the question.": 1,
    " It's VCDs, it's a CD, it's a little bit of more compressed image.": 1,
    "They started with VHS.": 1,
    "They actually didn't wait for the latest technology.": 1,
    "They started in 92, 94.": 1,
    "So there are 57": 1,
    " million VCR in Nigeria that play VHS and these VCD.": 1,
    "It's a CD basically, it's a compact disc.": 1,
    " the streets.": 1,
    "You can be in a traffic jam and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water.": 1,
    "Yes.": 1,
    " And this really, I have to say, this really proves that storytelling, it's a commodity, it's a staple.": 1,
    "There is no life without stories.": 1
