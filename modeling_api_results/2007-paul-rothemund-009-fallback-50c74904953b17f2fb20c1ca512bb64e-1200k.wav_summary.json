    " There's an ancient and universal concept that words have power, that spells exist, and if we could only pronounce the right words, then...": 1,
    " you know, an avalanche would come and wipe out the hobbits, right?": 1,
    "So this is a very attractive idea because we're very lazy, like the sorcerer's apprentice or the world's greatest computer programmer.": 1,
    " And so this idea has a lot of traction with this.": 1,
    "We love the ideas that words, when pronounced, they're just little more than pure information, but they evoke some physical action in the real world that helps us do work.": 1,
    " And so, of course, with lots of programmable computers and robots around, this is an easy thing to picture.": 1,
    "So how many of you know what I'm talking about?": 1,
    "Raise your right hand.": 1,
    " How many of you don't know what I'm talking about?": 1,
    "Raise your left hand.": 1,
    "That's great.": 1,
    "That was too easy.": 1,
    "You guys have very insecure computers.": 1,
    " So now the thing is that this is a different kind of spell.": 1,
    "This is a computer program made of zeros and ones.": 1,
    "It can be pronounced on a computer.": 1,
    "It does something like this.": 1,
    " The important thing is we can write it in a high-level language.": 1,
    "A computer magician can write this thing.": 1,
    "It can be compiled into zeros and ones and pronounced by a computer, and that's what makes computers powerful, these high-level languages that can be compiled.": 1,
    " I'm here to tell you don't need a computer to actually have a spell.": 1,
    "In fact, what you can do at the molecular level is that if you encode information, you encode a spell or program as molecules, then physics can actually directly interpret that information": 1,
    " and run a program.": 1,
    "That's what happens in proteins.": 1,
    "When this amino acid sequence gets pronounced as atoms, these little letters are sticky for each other.": 1,
    "It collapses into a three dimensional shape.": 1,
    " that turns it into a nanomachine that actually cuts DNA.": 1,
    "And the interesting thing is that if you change the sequence, you change the three-dimensional folding, you get now a DNA stapler instead.": 1,
    " These are the kind of molecular programs that we want to be able to write, but the problem is we don't know the machine language of proteins.": 1,
    "We don't have a compiler for proteins.": 1,
    " So I've joined a growing band of people that try to make molecular spells using DNA.": 1,
    "We use DNA because it's cheaper, it's easier to handle, it's something that we understand really well.": 1,
    "We understand it so well, in fact,": 1,
    " that we think we can actually write programming languages for DNA and have molecular compilers.": 1,
    "So then we think we can do that.": 1,
    "And my first question doing this, or one of my questions doing this, was how can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of DNA?": 1,
    " And I decided to use a type of DNA origami where you take a long strand of DNA and fold it into whatever shape or pattern you might want.": 1,
    "So here's a shape.": 1,
    "I actually spent about a year in my home in my underwear coating like Linus in that picture before.": 1,
    " And this program takes a shape, spits out 250 DNA sequences.": 1,
    "These short DNA sequences are going to fold a long strand into this shape that we want to make.": 1,
    " So you send an email with these sequences in it to a company, and what it does is the company pronounces them on a DNA synthesizer.": 1,
    "It's a machine about the size of a photocopier.": 1,
    "And what happens is they take your email, and every letter in your email, they replace a 30-atom cluster.": 1,
    " one for each letter, A, T, C, and G, and DNA.": 1,
    "They string them up in the right sequence, and then they send them back to you via FedEx.": 1,
    "So you get 250 of these in the mail in little tubes.": 1,
    "I mix them together, add a little bit of salt water,": 1,
    " and then add this long strand I was telling you about that I've stolen from a virus.": 1,
    "And then what happens is you heat this whole thing up to about boiling, you cool it down,": 1,
    " to room temperature and as you do what happens is those short strands they do the following thing each one of them binds that long strand in one place": 1,
    " and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place and brings those two parts of the long strand close together so that they stick together.": 1,
    "And so the net effect of all 250 of these strands": 1,
    " is to fold the thing into the shape, fold the long strand into the shape that you're looking for.": 1,
    "It'll approximate that shape.": 1,
    "We do this for real in the test tube.": 1,
    "In each little drop of water, you get 50 billion of these guys.": 1,
    "You can look with a microscope and see them on a surface.": 1,
    " And the neat thing is that if you change the sequence and change the spell, you just change the sequence of the staples, you can make a molecule that looks like this.": 1,
    "And, you know, he likes to hang out with his buddies, right?": 1,
    "And a lot of them are actually pretty good.": 1,
    " If you change the spell again, you change the sequence again, you get really nice 130 nanometer triangles.": 1,
    "If you do it again, you can get...": 1,
    " arbitrary patterns, so on a rectangle you can paint patterns of North and South America, or the words DNA.": 1,
    " That's DNA origami.": 1,
    "That's one way, there are many ways, of casting molecular spells using DNA.": 1,
    "What we really want to do in the end is learn how to program self-assembly so that we can build anything, right?": 1,
    " We want to be able to build technological artifacts that are maybe good for the world.": 1,
    "We want to learn how to build biological artifacts like people and whales and trees.": 1,
    "And if it's the case that we can reach that level of complexity, if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good,": 1,
    " then that will truly be magic.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
