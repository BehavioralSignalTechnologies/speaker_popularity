    " I wanted to be a musician": 1,
    " y gracias a Dios logr\u00e9 serlo.": 1,
    " I had from my teachers, from my family, from my community, all the support I needed to become a musician.": 1,
    " y so\u00f1etro a mi vida en que los dem\u00e1s ni\u00f1os, los dem\u00e1s j\u00f3venes, todos los j\u00f3venes de venezolanos tuviesen la misma oportunidad que yo.": 1,
    " And from there, the idea that has always been planted in my heart of turning music into a profound and global reality of my country.": 1,
    " I saw from the first rehearsal the future trajectory of this, because that trajectory gave me the magnitude of the challenge that that rehearsal brought me.": 1,

    " and names four major world orchestras, and the fifth is the Juvenile Symphony of Venezuela.": 1,
    "And today we can say...": 1,
    " that art has ceased to be a monopoly of elites in Latin America and has become a social right, a right of the people and of the entire people.": 1,
    " There is no distinction between black and white, whether you have money or not.": 1,
    " Simply, if you have a talent, if you have a vocation, and if you want to be, then you just go in, you share, and you make music anyway.": 1,
    " During the recent tour of the Sinfonica de la Juventud de Nesolana Simon Bolivar by the United States and Europe,": 1,
    " We were able to appreciate how our music moved young audiences to the bottom of their souls.": 1,
    " How the young and the children were bouncing on the stage.": 1,
    " to share our musicians' jackets.": 1,
    " How the endless ovations, sometimes of more than 20 minutes or half an hour, were indefinitely extended, and how the public, at the end of the concerts, went out into the street to receive our young people successfully.": 1,

    " It develops its self-esteem and it cultivates the ethical and aesthetic values that are linked to what it does in music.": 1,

    " After so much time here, it's life.": 1,
    "Music is life for us.": 1,
    " Each young man and each child in the system has their own history.": 1,
    " y para mi todas son igualmente importantes y trascendentales.": 1,
    " Puedo citar, por ejemplo, el caso de Edickson Ruiz.": 1,
    " who was a child in a parish in Caracas.": 1,
    " that voluntarily and passionately attended his classes in the Youth Orchestra of San Agust\u00edn del Sur.": 1,
    " And from his effort, with the exemplary support of his mother, his family and his people, he has become the main member of the row of contrabajos of the Berlin Philharmonic.": 1,

    " flexible, innovative, adapted to the characteristics of each community and each region.": 1,
    " and that today covers 300,000 children and young people of middle and low income in all of Venezuela.": 1,
    " In other words, it is a program of social rescue, of profound cultural transformation.": 1,
    " for all Venezuelan society.": 1,
    " without distinguishing them from any other species, but with special emphasis on vulnerable or at risk sectors.": 1,
    "There are three fundamental spheres in which the impact of the system is expressed.": 1,
    " la esfera personal social.": 1,
    " la esfera familiar y la esfera comunitaria.": 1,
    " En la esfera personal-social se destaca el desarrollo intelectual y afectivo de los ni\u00f1os.": 1,
    " that are involved in the choirs and orchestras.": 1,
    " La m\u00fasica se constituye en fuente de desarrollo de las dimensiones del ser humano que eleva su condici\u00f3n espiritual y lo conduce a un desarrollo integral de su personalidad.": 1,
    "De tal manera pues,": 1,

    " S.": 1,
    " el sentirse nadie.": 1,
    " el no ser nadie.": 1,
    " the lack of identification.": 1,
    " the lack of public esteem.": 1,
    " is setting rock.": 1,
    " And that is why the development of the child in the orchestra and the choir projects it with a noble identity, turns it into a model for his family and for his community.": 1,
    " makes him a better student in his regular studies.": 1,
    " because it infuses a sense of discipline, of constancy, of punctuality, which helps him enormously in his regular studies.": 1,
    "In the family scene,": 1,
    " the unconditional support of the parents of the family stands out.": 1,
    " El ni\u00f1o se constituye en un modelo para su madre, para su padre, y esto es important\u00edsimo en un ni\u00f1o pobre.": 1,
    " El ni\u00f1o, al descubrirse, importante para su familia, comienza a buscar nuevos caminos de superaci\u00f3n.": 1,

    " and that excludes it as a luxury and turns it into a common heritage of society, makes a child be able to play the violin in his house while the father works in his carpentry.": 1,
    " that a child can play the clarinet in his home in front of his mother, who does household chores.": 1,
    " And that, undoubtedly, the whole family participates with joy and pride in the activity of the orchestras and choirs to which their children belong.": 1,
    " The immense spiritual richness that music engenders in itself, and that comes through music and in music, ends up defeating material poverty.": 1,
    " Desde que el ni\u00f1o asume un instrumento con un maestro, ya no es un ni\u00f1o pobre, es un ni\u00f1o en ascenso hacia un nivel profesional de acci\u00f3n que lo convierte en un ciudadano pleno.": 1,
