    " If you'd like to learn how to play the lobster, we have some here.": 1,
    "And that's not a joke, we really do.": 1,
    "So come up afterwards and I'll show you how to play a lobster.": 1,
    " So actually, I started working on what's called the mantis shrimp a few years ago because they make sound.": 1,
    "This is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp that's found off the coast of California.": 1,
    " And while that's an absolutely fascinating sound, it actually turns out to be a very difficult project.": 1,
    "And while I was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp or stomatopods make sound, I started to think about their appendages.": 1,
    " And mantis shrimp are called mantis shrimp after the praying mantises, which also have a fast-feeding appendage.": 1,
    "And I started to think, well,": 1,
    " Maybe it'll be interesting while listening to their sounds to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes.": 1,
    "And so today I'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike, work that I've done in collaboration with Wyatt Korf and Roy Caldwell.": 1,
    " So mantis shrimp come in two varieties.": 1,
    "There are spears and smashers.": 1,
    "And this is a spearing mantis shrimp or stomatopod.": 1,
    "And he lives in the sand.": 1,
    "And he catches things that go by overhead.": 1,
    "So a quick strike like that.": 1,
    " And if we slow it down a little bit, this is the mantis shrimp, the same species, recorded at 1,000 frames per second, played back at 15 frames per second.": 1,
    "And you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs.": 1,
    " exploding upward to actually just catch a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it.": 1,
    "Now the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod and these guys open up snails for a living.": 1,
    " And so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack.": 1,
    "So I'll play it one more time.": 1,
    "He wiggles it in place, touches it with his nose.": 1,
    " and smash and a few smashes later the snail is broken open and he's got a good dinner.": 1,
    " So the Smasher Reptorial Appendage can stab with the point at the end or can smash with the heel.": 1,
    "And today I'll talk about the smashing": 1,
    " type of strike.": 1,
    "And so the first question that came to mind was, well, how fast does this limb move?": 1,
    "Because it's moving pretty darn fast in that video.": 1,
    "And I immediately": 1,
    " came upon a problem.": 1,
    "Every single high-speed video system in the biology department at Berkeley wasn't fast enough to catch this movement.": 1,
    "We simply couldn't capture it on video.": 1,
    " And so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time.": 1,
    "And then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department looking for a story.": 1,
    " uh... to do about new technologies in biology and so we struck a big deal i said well if you guys rent the high-speed video system that could capture these movements": 1,
    " You guys can film us collecting the data.": 1,
    "And believe it or not, they went for it.": 1,
    "So we got this incredible video system.": 1,
    "It's very new technology.": 1,
    "It just came out about a year ago.": 1,
    " that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light.": 1,
    "And low light is the critical issue with filming animals, because if it's too high, you fry them.": 1,
    " So this is a mantis shrimp.": 1,
    "There are the eyes up here.": 1,
    "And there's that raptorial appendage.": 1,
    "And there's the heel.": 1,
    "And that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail.": 1,
    "And the snail's wired to a stick, because he's a little bit easier to set up the shot.": 1,
    " And yeah.": 1,
    " I hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here.": 1,
    " So this was filmed at 5,000 frames per second.": 1,
    "And I'm playing it back at 15.": 1,
    "And so this slowed down 333 times.": 1,
    "And as you'll notice, it's still pretty gosh darn fast.": 1,
    " It slowed down 333 times.": 1,
    "It's an incredibly powerful movement.": 1,
    "The whole limb extends out.": 1,
    "The body flexes backwards.": 1,
    "Just a spectacular movement.": 1,
    " And so what we did is we took a look at these videos and we measured how fast the wind was moving to get back to that original question.": 1,
    "And we were in for our first surprise.": 1,
    " So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving at the peak speed, ranging from 10 meters per second, all the way up to 23 meters per second.": 1,
    "And for those of you who prefer miles per hour, that's over 45 miles per hour in water.": 1,
    "And this is really darn fast.": 1,
    "In fact, it's so fast.": 1,
    " We were able to add a new point on the extreme animal movement spectrum.": 1,
    "And mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike of any animal system.": 1,
    "So our first surprise.": 1,
    " So that was really cool and very unexpected.": 1,
    "So you might be wondering, well, how do they do it?": 1,
    "And actually, this work was done in the 1960s by a famous biologist named Malcolm Burroughs.": 1,
    " And what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use what's called a catch mechanism or click mechanism.": 1,
    "And what this basically consists of is a large muscle that takes a good long time to contract and a latch that prevents anything from moving.": 1,
    " So the muscle contracts, and nothing happens.": 1,
    "And once the muscle's contracted completely, everything's stored up, the latch flies upward, and you've got the movement.": 1,
    " And that's basically what's called a power amplification system.": 1,
    "It takes a long time for the muscle to contract and a very short time for the limb to fly out.": 1,
    " And so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story.": 1,
    "This is how mantis shrimp make these very fast strikes.": 1,
    "But then I took a trip to the National Museum of Natural History.": 1,
    "And if any of you ever have a chance, backstage of the National Museum of Natural History,": 1,
    " is one of the world's best collections of preserved mantis shrimp.": 1,
    " This is serious business for me.": 1,
    "What I saw on every single Manchester of limb, whether it's a spear or a smasher, is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure right on the top surface of the limb.": 1,
    " And you can see it right here.": 1,
    "It just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse.": 1,
    "It's a very beautiful structure.": 1,
    "And it's surrounded by membranous areas.": 1,
    "And those membranous areas suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure.": 1,
    " And this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while.": 1,
    "And then we did a series of calculations.": 1,
    "What we were able to show is that these mantis shrimp": 1,
    " have to have a spring.": 1,
    "There needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism in order to generate the amount of force that we observe and the speed that we observe and the output of the system.": 1,
    " So we thought, OK, this must be a spring.": 1,
    "The saddle could very well be a spring.": 1,
    "We went back to those high speed videos again, and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending.": 1,
    "And I'll just do that one more time.": 1,
    " And then if you take a look at the video, it's a little bit hard to see.": 1,
    "It's outlined in yellow.": 1,
    "The saddle is outlined in yellow.": 1,
    "You can actually see it extending over the course of the strike and actually hyper extending.": 1,
    " So we've had very solid evidence showing that that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends and does in fact function as a spring.": 1,
    " The saddle-shaped structure is also known as a hyperbolic paraboloid surface or an anticlastic surface, and this is very well known to engineers and architects.": 1,
    " because it's a very strong surface and compression.": 1,
    "It has curves in two directions, one curve upward and opposite transverse, curved down the other.": 1,
    "So any kind of perturbation spreads the forces over the surface of this type of shape.": 1,
    " So it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists.": 1,
    "It's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry because it requires very little material": 1,
    " to build this type of surface and it's very strong so if you're going to build a thin gold structure it's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong.": 1,
    "Now it's also known to architects": 1,
    " One of the most famous architects is Eduardo Catalano who popularized the structure.": 1,
    "And what's shown here is a saddle-shaped roof that he built that's 87 and a half feet span-wise.": 1,
    "It's two and a half inches thick and supported at two points.": 1,
    " And one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points.": 1,
    "And all of these are": 1,
    " the same principles that apply to the saddle-shaped spring in stomatopods.": 1,
    "In biological systems, it's important not to have a whole lot of extra material requirements for building it.": 1,
    " So very interesting parallels between the biological and the engineering worlds.": 1,
    "And interestingly, the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first described biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring.": 1,
    "That's a bit long, but it is sort of interesting.": 1,
    " So the next and final question was, well, how much force does a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails?": 1,
    "And so I wired up what's called a load cell.": 1,
    "A load cell measures forces.": 1,
    "And this is actually a piezo-electronic load cell that has a little crystal in it.": 1,
    " And when this crystal is squeezed, the electrical properties change in proportion to the forces that go in.": 1,
    " Animals are wonderfully aggressive and are really hungry all the time.": 1,
    "And so all I had to do was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell, and they'd smash away at it.": 1,
    "And so this is just a regular video.": 1,
    " of the animal just smashing the heck out of this load cell.": 1,
    " And we were able to get some force measurements out.": 1,
    "And again, we were in for a surprise.": 1,
    "I purchased a 100 pound load cell, thinking no animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal.": 1,
    "And what do you know, they immediately overloaded the load cell.": 1,
    " So these are actually some old data where I had to find the smallest animals in the lab.": 1,
    "And we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds generated by an animal about this big.": 1,
    " And actually, just last week, I got a 300-pound load cell up and running.": 1,
    "And I've clocked these animals, generating well over 200 pounds of force.": 1,
    "And again, I think this will be a world record.": 1,
    "I have to do a little bit more.": 1,
    " background reading, but I think this will be the largest amount of force produced by an animal per body mass.": 1,
    "So really incredible forces.": 1,
    "And again, that brings us back to the importance of that spring in storing up and releasing so much energy in the system.": 1,
    " But that was not the end of the story.": 1,
    "Now, I'm making this sound very easy.": 1,
    "This is actually a lot of work.": 1,
    "And I got all these force measurements.": 1,
    "And then I went and I looked at the force output.": 1,
    " of the system.": 1,
    "And it's just very simple.": 1,
    "Time is on the x-axis.": 1,
    "The force is on the y-axis.": 1,
    "You can see two peaks.": 1,
    "And that was what really got me puzzled.": 1,
    " The first peak obviously is the limb hitting the load cell.": 1,
    "But there's a really large second peak, half a millisecond later.": 1,
    " And I didn't know what that was.": 1,
    "Now, you'd expect a second peak for other reasons, but not half a millisecond later.": 1,
    "Again, going back to those high-speed videos, there is a pretty good hint of what might be going on.": 1,
    " Here's that same orientation that we saw earlier.": 1,
    "There's that rectorial appendage.": 1,
    "There's the heel.": 1,
    "It's going to swing around and hit the load cell.": 1,
    "And what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on the surface of the load cell.": 1,
    " as the limb comes flying through.": 1,
    "And I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light.": 1,
    " And so if we just take out one frame, what you can actually see there at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble.": 1,
    "And what this is is cavitation.": 1,
    " And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon, which occurs when you have areas of water moving at extremely different speeds.": 1,
    "When this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure.": 1,
    " which results in the water literally vaporizing.": 1,
    "And when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light, and heat.": 1,
    "It's a very destructive process.": 1,
    "And so here it is in the": 1,
    " stomatopod and again this is a situation where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon because it destroys boat propellers.": 1,
    "People have been struggling for years to": 1,
    " try to design a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it, just like these pictures show.": 1,
    "So this is a potent": 1,
    " force and fluid systems.": 1,
    "And just to sort of take it one step further, I'm going to show you the mantis approaching the snail.": 1,
    "This is taken at 20,000 frames per second.": 1,
    " And I have to give full credit to the BBC cameraman, Tim Green, for setting this shot up, because I could never have done this in a million years.": 1,
    "One of the benefits of working with professional cameramen.": 1,
    " You can see it coming in and an incredible flash of light and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail.": 1,
    " So really just an amazing image slowed down to extremely slow speeds.": 1,
    "And again, we can see it's slightly different form there, with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces.": 1,
    "In fact, you might have even seen some": 1,
    " cavitation going up the edge of the limb.": 1,
    " So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks, what I think was going on is that first impact is actually the limb hitting the load cell.": 1,
    "And the second impact is actually the collapse of the cavitation bubble.": 1,
    " And these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy storage with that specialized spring, but the extremes of the fluid dynamics.": 1,
    "And they might actually be making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail.": 1,
    " It's a really fascinating double whammy, so to speak, from these animals.": 1,
    "So one question I often get after this talk, so I figured I'd answer it now,": 1,
    " Well, what happens to the animal?": 1,
    "Because obviously if it's breaking snails, the poor limb must be disintegrating and indeed it does.": 1,
    "These animals, that's the smashing part of the heel on both of those images and it gets worn away.": 1,
    "In fact, I've seen them wear away their heel all the way to the flesh.": 1,
    " But one of the convenient things about being an arthropod is that you have to molt.": 1,
    "And every three months or so, these animals molt, and they build a new limb, and it's no problem.": 1,
    "And very convenient solution to that particular problem.": 1,
    " So.": 1,
    " I'd like to end on sort of a wacky note.": 1,
    " Yeah.": 1,
    " Maybe this is all wacky to folks like you.": 1,
    "I don't know.": 1,
    "So the saddles, that saddle-shaped spring, has actually been well known to biologists for a long time, not as a spring, but as a visual signal.": 1,
    " And there's actually a spectacular colored dot in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods.": 1,
    " And this is quite interesting to find evolutionary origins of visual signals on what's really, in all species, their spring.": 1,
    " And I think one explanation for this could be going back to the molting phenomenon.": 1,
    "So these animals go into a molting period where they're unable to strike, their bodies become very soft, and they're literally unable to strike or they will self-destruct.": 1,
    " This is for real.": 1,
    "And what they do is up until that time period when they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful.": 1,
    "And they strike everything in sight, doesn't matter who or what.": 1,
    " And the second they get into that time point when they can't strike anymore, they just signal.": 1,
    "They wave their legs around.": 1,
    " And it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing.": 1,
    "It's a well-established fact in these animals that they actually bluff.": 1,
    "They can't actually strike, but they pretend to.": 1,
    "So I'm very curious about whether those colored dots": 1,
    " in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information about their ability to strike or their strike force and something about the time period in the molting cycle.": 1,
    " So sort of an interesting, strange fact to find a visual structure right in the middle of their spring.": 1,
    " So to conclude, I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators, Wyatt Corf and Roy Caldwell, who worked closely with me on this.": 1,
    " and also the Miller Institute for Basic Research and Science, which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time, and for that I'm very grateful.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
