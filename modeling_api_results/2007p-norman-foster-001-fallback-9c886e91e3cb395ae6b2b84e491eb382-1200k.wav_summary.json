    " As an architect, you design for the present with an awareness of the past.": 1,
    " for a future which is essentially unknown.": 1,
    " The Green Agenda is probably the most important agenda and issue of the day and I'd like to share some experience": 1,
    " Over the last 40 years, we celebrate our 40th anniversary this year.": 1,
    "And to explore and to touch on some observations about the nature of": 1,
    " sustainability, how far you can anticipate what follows from it, what are the threats, what are the possibilities, the challenges, the opportunities.": 1,
    " I've said in the past many, many years ago, before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda, that it wasn't about fashion, it was about survival.": 1,
    " But what I never said.": 1,
    " And what I'm really going to make the point is that really, green is cool.": 1,
    "I mean, all the projects which have in some way been inspired by that agenda": 1,
    " are about a celebratory lifestyle, in a way celebrating the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life.": 1,
    " rarely actually quote anything.": 1,
    "So I'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can which somebody at the end of last year ventured the thought": 1,
    " about what for that individual, as a kind of important observer, analyst, writer, guy called Thomas Friedman, who wrote": 1,
    " in the Herald Tribune.": 1,
    "About 2006, he said,": 1,
    " I think the most important thing to happen in 2006 was that Living and Thinking Green hit Main Street.": 1,
    " We reached a tipping point this year, where living, acting, designing, investing, and manufacturing green": 1,
    " came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens, entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic, capitalistic, geopolitical and competitive thing they could do, hence my motto": 1,
    " green is the new red, white and blue.": 1,
    "And I ask myself in a way looking back, when did that kind of awareness of the planet": 1,
    " and its fragility first appear.": 1,
    "And I think it was July the 20th, 1969, when": 1,
    " for the first time man could look back at planet Earth.": 1,
    "And in a way it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase.": 1,
    " And before the kind of collapse of the communist system, I was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts in Space City and other places in Russia.": 1,
    "And interestingly, as I think back,": 1,
    " They were the first true environmentalists.": 1,
    "They were filled with a kind of pioneering passion, fired about the problems of the Aral Sea and": 1,
    " At that period it was, in a way, a number of things were happening.": 1,
    "Buckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru, again a word that had not been coined.": 1,
    " a design scientist, if you like, a poet, but he foresaw all the things that are happening now.": 1,
    "And it's another subject, it's another conversation.": 1,
    "You can go back to his writings, it's quite extraordinary.": 1,
    " It was at that time with...": 1,
    " an awareness fired by Bucky's prophecies, his concerns as a citizen, as a kind of citizen of the planet,": 1,
    " that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time.": 1,
    " A number of projects, I select this one because it was 1973 and it was a master plan for one of the Canary Islands.": 1,
    " This probably coincided with the time when you had the Planet Earth source book and you had the hippie movement and there is some of those qualities in this drawing which seeks to sum up": 1,
    " the recommendations and all the components are there which are now in common parlance in our vocabulary, you know, 30 odd years later.": 1,
    " wind energy, recycling, biomass, solar cells.": 1,
    " In parallel at that time, there was a very kind of exclusive design club, people who were really": 1,
    " design conscious were inspired by the work of Dieter Rams and the objects that he would create for the company called Brown.": 1,
    "This is going back the mid 50s, 60s and": 1,
    " Despite Bucky's prophecies that everything would be miniaturized and technology would make an incredible style, access to comfort, to amenities,": 1,
    " It was very, very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in this image would be very, very stylistically packaged, and that and more beside would be in the palm of your hand.": 1,
    "And I think that": 1,
    " That digital revolution now is coming to the point where as the virtual world, which brings so many people together here, finally connects with the physical world.": 1,
    " the reality that that has become humanized so that digital world has all the friendliness, all the immediacy, the orientation of the analog world probably summed up": 1,
    " in a way by the stylish or alternative available here, as we generously had gifted at lunchtime, the Maxsin, which is a further": 1,
    " kind of development and again inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel of very, very beautiful objects.": 1,
    "So something which in that": 1,
    " 50s, 60s was very exclusive has now become interestingly quite inclusive.": 1,
    "And the reference to the iPod as iconic and in a way evocative of performance, delivery,": 1,
    " Quite interesting that the beginning of the year, 2007, the Financial Times commented that the Detroit companies envy the halo effect that Toyota has gained from the Prius as the": 1,
    " hybrid energy conscious vehicle, which rivals the iPod as an iconic product.": 1,
    "And I think it's very tempting to": 1,
    " in a way seduce ourselves and as architects or anybody involved with the design process that the answer to our problems lies with buildings.": 1,
    "Buildings are important but they're only as": 1,
    " They're only a component of a much bigger picture.": 1,
    "In other words, as I might seek to demonstrate, if you could achieve the impossible, the equivalent of perpetual motion, you could design a carbon-free house, for example.": 1,
    " That would be the answer.": 1,
    "Unfortunately, it's not the answer.": 1,
    "It's only the beginning of the problem.": 1,
    "You cannot separate the buildings out from the infrastructure of cities and the mobility of transit.": 1,
    "For example,": 1,
    " If in that Bucky-inspired phrase we draw back and we look at planet Earth and we take a kind of typical industrialised society,": 1,
    " then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings 44%, transport 34% and industry.": 1,
    " But again, that only shows part of the picture.": 1,
    "If you look at the buildings together with the associated transport, in other words, the transport of people, which is 26%,": 1,
    " then 70% of the energy consumption is influenced by the way that our cities and infrastructure work together.": 1,
    " So the problems of sustainability cannot be separated from the nature of the cities of which the buildings are a part.": 1,
    " For example, if you take and you make a comparison between a recent kind of city, what I'll call simplistically a North American city, and Detroit is not a bad example, it is very": 1,
    " car dependent.": 1,
    "The city goes out in annular rings consuming more and more green space and more and more roads and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city centre": 1,
    " which again the city centre, as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial, again becomes dead.": 1,
    "If you compare Detroit": 1,
    " with a city of a northern European example, and Munich is not a bad example of that, with the greater dependence on walking and cycling than": 1,
    " a city which is really only twice as dense is only using one tenth of the energy.": 1,
    "In other words, you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous.": 1,
    " So basically, if you wanted to generalize, you can demonstrate.": 1,
    " that as the density increases along the bottom there, that the energy consumed reduces dramatically.": 1,
    " We can't separate this out from issues like social diversity, mass transit, the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance, the quality of civic spaces.": 1,
    " Again, you can see Detroit in yellow at the top.": 1,
    "Extraordinary consumption down below Copenhagen.": 1,
    "And Copenhagen, although it's a dense city, is not dense compared": 1,
    " with the really dense cities.": 1,
    "And in the year 2000, a rather interesting thing happened.": 1,
    "You had for the first time mega cities, five million or more.": 1,
    " which were occurring in the developing world.": 1,
    "And now out of typically 46 cities, 33 of those mega cities are in the developing world.": 1,
    " So you have to ask yourself the environmental impact of, for example, China or India.": 1,
    "If you take China and you just take Beijing,": 1,
    " you can see on that traffic system and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the": 1,
    " at the price of the bicycles.": 1,
    "In other words, if you put onto the roads, as is currently happening, 1,000 new cars every day,": 1,
    " statistically it's the biggest booming auto market in the world and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing reducing and": 1,
    " That urbanisation is extraordinarily accelerated pace.": 1,
    "So if we think of the transition in our society": 1,
    " of the movement from the land to the cities, which took 200 years, then that same process is happening in 20 years.": 1,
    "In other words, it is accelerating by a factor of 10.": 1,
    " Um.": 1,
    " And quite interestingly, over something like a 60-year period, we're seeing the doubling in life expectancy over that period where the urbanization has trebled.": 1,
    " If I pull back from that global picture and I look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology which as a tool": 1,
    " is a tool for designers, and I cite our own experience as a company.": 1,
    "And I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects.": 1,
    " How do you measure that change of technology?": 1,
    "How does it affect the design of buildings and particularly": 1,
    " How can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy, create less pollution, and are more socially responsible?": 1,
    " That story in terms of building started in the late 60s, early 70s.": 1,
    "The one example I take is a corporate headquarters for a company called Willis Faber in a small market town in": 1,
    " in the northeast of England, commuting distance with London.": 1,
    "And here the first thing you can see is that this building, the roof,": 1,
    " is a very warm kind of overcoat blanket, a kind of insulating garden, which is also about the celebration of public space.": 1,
    "In other words, for this community, they have this garden in the sky.": 1,
    " The humanistic ideal is very, very strong in all this work and encapsulated perhaps by": 1,
    " one of my early sketches here where you can see greenery, you can see sunlight, you have a connection with nature and nature is part of the generator, the driver for this building and symbolically the colours are": 1,
    " of the interior are green and yellow.": 1,
    "It has facilities like swimming pools, it has flexi time, it has a social heart, a space, you have contact with nature.": 1,
    "Now this was 1973.": 1,
    " In 2001, this building received an award, and the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time.": 1,
    " And the people who had created it came back, the project managers, the company chairman then, and they were saying, you know, the architects, Norman was always going on about designing for the future and, you know, it didn't seem to cost us anymore.": 1,
    " We humoured him, we kept him happy.": 1,
    "The image at the top, what it doesn't really... If you look at it in detail, really what it is saying is you...": 1,
    " can wire this building.": 1,
    "This building was wired for change.": 1,
    "So in 1975, the image there is of typewriters.": 1,
    "And when the photograph was taken, it's word processors.": 1,
    " And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology.": 1,
    " We were fortunate because in a way our building was future-proofed.": 1,
    "It anticipated change, even though those changes were not known.": 1,
    " Round about that.": 1,
    " design period leading up to this building.": 1,
    "I did a sketch which we pulled out of the archive recently and I was saying and I wrote, but we don't have the time and we really don't have the immediate": 1,
    " expertise at a technical level.": 1,
    "In other words we didn't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building and that would be to create a kind of three-dimensional bubble.": 1,
    " a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate, would breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads.": 1,
    " notwithstanding the fact that the building is, as a green building, is very much a pioneering building.": 1,
    "And if I fast forward in time, what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory.": 1,
    " The Library of the Free University, which opened last year, is an example of that.": 1,
    "And again, the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality": 1,
    " and a combination of devices here, the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks, and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin.": 1,
    " which enables the building to be ventilated to consume dramatically less energy and where it's really working with the forces of nature.": 1,
    "What is interesting is that this is": 1,
    " is hugely popular by the people who use it.": 1,
    "Again, coming back to that thing about the lifestyle and in a way the": 1,
    " the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit.": 1,
    "So it's not a kind of sacrifice, quite the reverse.": 1,
    "I think it's a great celebration and you can measure": 1,
    " the performance in terms of energy consumption of that building against a typical library.": 1,
    " If I show another aspect of that technology, then in a completely different context, there's apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland.": 1,
    " prefabricated from the most traditional of materials.": 1,
    "But that material, because of the technology, the computing ability, the ability to prefabricate, make high-performance components out of timber,": 1,
    " very much at the cutting edge.": 1,
    "And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology, the ability to plot points in the sky.": 1,
    " and to transmit, to transfer": 1,
    " that information now directly into the factory.": 1,
    "So if you cross the border, just across the border, a small factory in Germany and here you can see the guy": 1,
    " with his computer screen and those points in space are communicated and on the left": 1,
    " are the cutting machines which then in the factory enable those individual pieces to be fabricated and plus or minus very very few millimetres to be slotted together on site and then": 1,
    " Interestingly, that building to then be clad in the oldest technology, which is the kind of hand-cut shingles, one quarter of a million of them applied by hand,": 1,
    " as the final finish and, again, the way in which that works as a building for those of us who can enjoy the spaces to live and visit there.": 1,
    " If I made the leap into these new technologies, then what happened before that?": 1,
    "What was life like before the mobile phone?": 1,
    "The things that you take for granted.": 1,
    " Well, obviously the building still happened.": 1,
    "I mean, this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank.": 1,
    " of 1979 which opened in 1985 with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of this space here.": 1,
    " In the absence of computers, you had to physically model.": 1,
    "So for example, we would put models under an artificial sky.": 1,
    " for wind tunnels we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air and the many kilometres of cable and so on.": 1,
    "And the turning point was probably in our terms when we had": 1,
    " the first computer and that was at the time that we sought to redesign, reinvent the airport.": 1,
    " Terminal 4 at Heathrow, typical of any terminal.": 1,
    "Big heavy roof blocking out the sunlight, lots of machinery, big pipes, whirring machinery.": 1,
    " Stansted, the green alternative which uses natural light, is a friendly place, you know where you are, you can relate to the outside, and for a large part of its cycle not needing electric light.": 1,
    " Electric light which in turn creates more heat which creates more cooling loads and so on and at that particular point in time": 1,
    " This was one of the few solitary computers, and that's a little image of the tree of Stansted.": 1,
    " not going back very far in time, 1990, that's our office.": 1,
    "And if you look very closely, you'd see that people were drawing with pencils and they were pushing big rulers and triangles.": 1,
    " It's not that long ago, 17 years, and here we are now.": 1,
    "I mean, major transformation.": 1,
    " going back in time there was a lady called Valerie Larkin and in 1987 she had all our information on one disk.": 1,
    "Now every week we have": 1,
    " the equivalent of 84 million disks which record our archival information on past, current and future projects.": 1,
    " That reaches 21 kilometers into the sky.": 1,
    "This is the view you would get if you look down on that.": 1,
    "But meanwhile, as...": 1,
    " you know, wonderful protagonists like Al Gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature set in the context of that": 1,
    " Interestingly, those buildings which are celebratory and very, very relevant to this place are Reichstag Project, which": 1,
    " has a very familiar agenda, I'm sure, as a public place where we sought to, in a way, through a process of advocacy,": 1,
    " reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians, public space, and maybe its hidden agenda, an energy manifesto, something that would be free": 1,
    " completely free of fuel as we know it.": 1,
    "So it will be totally renewable.": 1,
    "And again, the humanistic sketch, the translation,": 1,
    " into the public space but this very very much a part of the ecology but here not having to model it for real.": 1,
    "Obviously the wind tunnel had a place": 1,
    " But the ability now with the computer to explore, to plan, to see how that would work in terms of the forces of nature, natural ventilation, to be able to model the chamber below, and to look at": 1,
    " biomass a combination of biomass aquifers burning vegetable oil": 1,
    " process that, quite interestingly, was developed in eastern Germany at the time of its dependence on the Soviet bloc.": 1,
    " really retranslating that technology and developing something which was so clean it was virtually pollution free.": 1,
    "You can measure it again, you can compare": 1,
    " how that building in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year at the time that we took that project over 7,000 tons": 1,
    " what it would have been with natural gas.": 1,
    "And finally, with the vegetable oil, 450 tons.": 1,
    "I mean, a 94% reduction, virtually clean.": 1,
    " We can see the same processes at work in terms of the Comets Bank, its dependence on natural ventilation, the way that you can model those gardens, the way they spiral around.": 1,
    "But again, very much about the lifestyle, the quality, something that would be": 1,
    " more enjoyable as a place to work.": 1,
    "And again, we can measure the reduction in terms of energy consumption.": 1,
    " There is an evolution here between the projects and Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further, the project in the city in London.": 1,
    " And this sequence shows the buildup of that model, but what it shows first, which I think is quite interesting, is that here you see the circle, you see the public space around it,": 1,
    " What are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site?": 1,
    "If, for example, you seek to do a building which goes right to the edge of the pavement,": 1,
    " It's the same amount of space.": 1,
    " And finally you profile this, you cut grooves into it, the grooves become the kind of green lungs which give views, which give light, ventilation.": 1,
    " make the building fresher and you enclose that with something that also is central to its appearance, which is a mesh of triangulated structures.": 1,
    "Again,": 1,
    " in a long connection evocative of some of those works of Buckminster Fuller and the way in which triangulation can increase performance and also give that building its sense of identity.": 1,
    " And here, if we look at the detail of the way that the building opens up and breathes into those atria, the way in which now with a computer,": 1,
    " We can model the forces.": 1,
    "We can see the high pressure, the low pressure, the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing.": 1,
    " So it also has the ability all the time, regardless of the direction of the wind, to be able to make the building fresh and efficient.": 1,
    " And unlike conventional buildings, the top of the building is celebratory.": 1,
    "It's a viewing place for people, not machinery.": 1,
    "And the base of the building is again about public space.": 1,
    " comparing it with a typical building.": 1,
    "What happens if we seek to use such design strategies in terms of really large-scale thinking?": 1,
    " And I'm just going to give two images out of a kind of company research project.": 1,
    "It's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying.": 1,
    " the level is dropping rather like the Aral Sea and the Dead Sea is obviously much lower than the": 1,
    " oceans and seas around it.": 1,
    "So there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea by creating a pipeline": 1,
    " a pipe, sometimes above the surface, sometimes buried, that will redress that and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba into the Dead Sea.": 1,
    "And our translation of that": 1,
    " using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years, is to say, what if that, instead of being just a pipe, what if it is a lifeline?": 1,
    "What if it is the equivalent, depending on where you are, of the Grand Canal?": 1,
    " in terms of tourists, habitation, desalination, agriculture, in other words, water is the lifeblood.": 1,
    "And if you just go back to the previous image and you look at this area of volatility and hostility,": 1,
    " that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the effect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause in terms of something that would be genuinely": 1,
    " green and productive in the widest sense.": 1,
    " Infrastructure at that large scale is also inseparable from communication, and whether that communication is the virtual world or the physical world,": 1,
    " world and it's absolutely central to society and how do we make more legible in this growing world especially": 1,
    " in some of the places that I'm talking about, China for example, which in the next 10 years will create 400 new airports.": 1,
    "What form do they take?": 1,
    "How do you make them more friendly at that scale?": 1,
    " Hong Kong, I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age because you always have a point of reference.": 1,
    "So what happens when we take that": 1,
    " and you expand that further into the Chinese society.": 1,
    "And what is interesting": 1,
    " is that that produces in a way perhaps the ultimate mega building.": 1,
    "It is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment.": 1,
    " 250,000 people working 24 hours, 7 days.": 1,
    "Larger by 17% than every terminal put together at Heathrow, built plus the new unbuilt Terminal 5.": 1,
    " And the challenge here is a building that will be green, that is compact despite its size, and is about the human experience of travel, is about": 1,
    " friendly is coming back to that starting point is very, very much about the lifestyle.": 1,
    " Perhaps these, in the end, as celebratory spaces, as Hubert was talking over lunch, as we sort of engaged in conversation, talked about this, talked about cities, Hubert was saying absolutely correct, these are the new cathedrals.": 1,
    " And in a way one aspect of this conversation was triggered on New Year's Eve when I was talking about the": 1,
    " Olympic agenda in China in terms of its green ambitions and aspirations and I was voicing the thought": 1,
    " that it just crossed my mind that New Year's Eve, a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007,": 1,
    " that maybe, you know, the future was, you know, the most powerful, innovative sort of nation, the way in which somebody like Kennedy, inspirationally, could say we put a man on the moon, you know, who is going to say": 1,
    " that we crack this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes and so on.": 1,
    "And that's a concerted platform.": 1,
    "It's more than one device.": 1,
    "It's renewable.": 1,
    " And I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year, I thought the inspiration was more likely to come from those other larger countries out there, the Chinas, the Indians, the Asian Pacific Tigers.": 1,
