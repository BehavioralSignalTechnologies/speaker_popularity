    " My name is Harry Baker Harry Baker is my name If your name was Harry Baker then our names would be the same": 1,
    " It's a short introductory poem.": 1,
    "Yeah, I'm Harry.": 1,
    "I study maths.": 1,
    "I write poetry.": 1,
    "So I thought I'd start with a love poem about prime numbers.": 1,
    " This is called 59.": 1,
    "I was gonna call it Primetime Loving.": 1,
    " That reaction is why I didn't.": 1,
    "So, 59.": 1,
    " 59 wakes up on the wrong side of the bed, realizes all his hair is on one side of his head, takes just under a minute.": 1,
    "To a cow that is, because of the way that he slept, he finds some clothes and gets dressed.": 1,
    " You can help but look in the mirror and be subtly impressed how he looks rough around the edges and yet casually mess, and as he glances out the window, sees a study he is blessed with of 60 from across the street.": 1,
    "Now, 60 was beautiful.": 1,
    " Perfectly trim cue to cause dressing something suitable and never rude or crude at all Unimprovable right on time as usual more on cue than a snooker ball, but like to play it super cool": 1,
    " 15, I wanted to tell her that he knew her favorite flower.": 1,
    "He thought of her every second, every minute, every hour, but he knew it wouldn't work.": 1,
    "He'd never get the girl because the low she lived across the street that came from different walls of 59 and my 60s perfectly round figure.": 1,
    " 60 thought 59 was odd.": 1,
    " You see, one of his favorite films was 101 Dalmatians.": 1,
    "She preferred the sequel.": 1,
    " He romanticized the idea they were star-crossed lovers.": 1,
    "They could overcome the odds and evens because they had each other while she maintained the strict rules and based on her by her mother that separate could not be equal.": 1,
    " And though at the time you felt stupid and dumb Trying to love a girl controlled by her stupid moments You'd have been comforted by the simple song Take 59 away from 60 And you're left with the one": 1,
    " And sure enough, after two months of moping around 61 days later, 61 was who he found.": 1,
    "He had lost his keys and his parents were out, so one day after school he went into a house and as he noticed...": 1,
    " the slightly wonky numbers on the door he wondered why he never introduced himself before as he let him in his jaw dropped and all 61 was like 60 with a little bit more": 1,
    " See, she had prettier eyes and an approachable smile.": 1,
    "And like him, rough around the edges, casual style.": 1,
    "And like him, everything was in its organized parts.": 1,
    "And like him, it didn't matter if a friend stayed a while, because she was like him.": 1,
    "And he liked her.": 1,
    " I reckon she would like him if she knew he was like her and it was different this time.": 1,
    "I mean, this girl was wicked, so we plucked up the courage and asked for her digits, she said.": 1,
    " I'm 61.": 1,
    " He grinned and said, I'm 59.": 1,
    "Today I've had a really nice time, so tomorrow if you wanted you could come over to mine.": 1,
    "She said, sure.": 1,
    " She loved talking to someone just as quirky.": 1,
    "So she agreed to this unofficial first date.": 1,
    "In the end, it was only already one minute early, but that didn't matter because she arrived one minute late.": 1,
    "And from that moment on, there was nonstop chatter.": 1,
    "How they loved X factor, how they had two factors, how that did not matter.": 1,
    " for joining us live from the": 1,
    " Distinctiveness made them better.": 1,
    "And by the end of the night, you knew that they met together on one day.": 1,
    "She was talking about stuck up 60.": 1,
    " She noticed that 59 looked a bit shifty.": 1,
    "He blushed and told her of his crush.": 1,
    "The best thing that never happened because it led to us.": 1,
    "And 61 was clever, see?": 1,
    "Not prone to jealousy.": 1,
    "She looked him in the eyes and told him quite tenderly,": 1,
    " You're 59, I'm 61.": 1,
    "Together we combine to become twice what 60 could ever be.": 1,
    " And at this point, 59 had tears in his eyes.": 1,
    "I was so glad to have this one-of-a-kind girl in his life.": 1,
    "He told her the very definition of being promised that only one in himself could his heart divide, and she was the one he wanted to give his heart to.": 1,
    " She said she felt the same when she knew the films were half true because that wasn't real love.": 1,
    "The love was just a sample.": 1,
    "When it came to real love, they were a prime example.": 1,
    " Cheers.": 1,
    " That was the first poem that I wrote and it was for a prime number themed poetry nights.": 1,
    " which turned out to be a prime number themed poetry competition.": 1,
    "And I became a prime number themed poetry competition winner, or as I like to call it, of prime minister.": 1,
    " And this is how I discovered these things called poetry slams.": 1,
    "And if you don't know what a poetry slam is, it was a format come up with in America 30 years ago as a way of tricking people into going to poetry events by putting an exciting word like slam on the end.": 1,
    " And each performer got three minutes to perform, and then random audience members would hold up scorecards, and they'd end up with a numerical score.": 1,
    "And what this meant is it kind of broke down the barrier between performer and audience.": 1,
    " and encourage the kind of connection with the listener.": 1,
    "What it also means is you can win.": 1,
    "And if you win a poetry slam, you can call yourself a slam champion and pretend you're a wrestler.": 1,
    " And if you lose the purchase line, you can say, oh, well, purchase is a subjective art form.": 1,
    "You can't put numbers on such things.": 1,
    " Um...": 1,
    " But I loved it and I got involved in these slams and I became the UK slam champion and got invited to the Poetry World Cup in Paris, which was unbelievable.": 1,
    "It's people from all around the world speaking in their native languages to be judged by five French strangers.": 1,
    " And somehow I won, which was great.": 1,
    "And I've been able to travel the world since doing it.": 1,
    "But it also means that this next piece is technically the best poem in the world.": 1,
    " Uh huh.": 1,
    " So.": 1,
    " according to five French strangers.": 1,
    "So this is Paper People.": 1,
    " I like people.": 1,
    " I'd like some paper people.": 1,
    "They'd be purple paper people, maybe pop-up purple paper people, proper pop-up purple paper people.": 1,
    "How do you prop up proper pop-up purple paper people?": 1,
    "I hear you cry.": 1,
    " Well, I": 1,
    " I'd probably prop up, prop up, prop up purple paper people with a prop up, prop up, purple paper clip, but I'd pre-prepare a prop here that he says has alternative to chica packet, which is a case of it being slipped, because I could build a prop up metropolis.": 1,
    " but I wouldn't want to deal with all those paper people politics, paper politicians with their paper thin policies, broken promises, that appropriate apologies.": 1,
    "There'd be a little paper me and a little paper you.": 1,
    "And we could watch paper TV and it would all be pay per view.": 1,
    " We'd see those poppy paper wrappers rub about the paper package or paper people carriers get stuck in paper traffic on the A4.": 1,
    " Oh my god.": 1,
    " There'll be a paper princess Kate, but we don't stare at paper pipper.": 1,
    " And we'd all live in fear of Killer Jack the Paper Ripper.": 1,
    " Because the paper propaganda propagates the people's prejudices, paper-spinning pictures of the footage of the terrorists.": 1,
    "It's a little paper me, and a little paper you.": 1,
    "And in a pop-up population, people's problems pop up too.": 1,
    "There'd be that pompous paper parliament who": 1,
    " remained out of touch and have ignored the people's protests over all the paper cuts and then the peaceful paper protests would get blown to paper pieces by the confetti cannons by the preemptive police and yes, there'd still be paper money, so there'd still be paper greed.": 1,
    " And the paper piggy bankers put in more than they need.": 1,
    "Purchasing the pulperry to pepper their paper properties.": 1,
    "Others live in poverty and ain't acknowledged properly.": 1,
    "A proper poor economy with so many a proper poor.": 1,
    " Water needs to get ignored.": 1,
    "The money goes to big wars.": 1,
    "Origami armies unfold plans for paper planes.": 1,
    "And we remain imprisoned in our own paper chains.": 1,
    "But the greatest shame is that it always seems to stay the same.": 1,
    " What changes is who's in power choosing how to lay the blame, they're naming names, forgetting these are names of people.": 1,
    "Because in the end it all comes down to people.": 1,
    "I like people.": 1,
    " Because even when the situation is dire, there's only ever people who were able to inspire it on paper.": 1,
    "It's hard to see how we all cope.": 1,
    "But in the bottom of Pandora's box, there's still hope.": 1,
    "And that's still hope because I believe in people.": 1,
    "People like my grandparents.": 1,
    " who every single day since I was born have taken time out of their morning to pray for me.": 1,
    " That's 7,892 days straight of someone checking I'm okay and that's amazing.": 1,
    " People like my aunt who puts on plays with prisoners.": 1,
    "People who are capable of genuine forgiveness.": 1,
    "People like the persecuted Palestinians who got out of their way to make your life better and expect nothing in return.": 1,
    "You see, people have potential to be powerful.": 1,
    " Just because the people in power tend to pretend to be bricks, they don't need to succumb to that system.": 1,
    "And the paper population is no different.": 1,
    "So it's a little paper me.": 1,
    " and a little paper you.": 1,
    "And then the pop-up populations, people's problems pop up too.": 1,
    "And if the whole world fell apart, then we still make it through because we're people.": 1,
    " Yeah.": 1,
    "I've just got time for one more.": 1,
    "For me, poetry has been the ultimate way of kind of ideas without frontiers.": 1,
    "When I first started, the people that inspired me were the ones with amazing stories.": 1,
    " You know, 18 year old with a happy life.": 1,
    "You know, it was too normal, but I could kind of create these worlds where I could talk about my experiences and dreams and beliefs.": 1,
    "And so, you know, it's amazing to be here in front of you today.": 1,
    "Thank you for being here.": 1,
    "If you weren't here.": 1,
    " It would be pretty much like the sound check yesterday.": 1,
    "And this is more fun.": 1,
    "So this last one's called The Sound Check It.": 1,
    "Thank you very much for listening.": 1,
    " Old man sunshine was proud of his son.": 1,
    "And it brightens his day to see his little boy run.": 1,
    "Not because of what he'd done, nor the problems I've overcome, but that despite that his disposition remained a sunny one as I hadn't always been like this.": 1,
    " There have been times when he tried to hide his brightness.": 1,
    "You see, every star hits periods of hardship.": 1,
    "It takes a bride to like to inspire them through the darkness.": 1,
    "And if we go back to when he was born in a nebula, we know that he never was thought of as regular because he had a flare about him.": 1,
    " To say the Midas touch is wrong, but all he went near since eternal little bronze.": 1,
    "Yes, this son was loved by some more than others.": 1,
    " case of Joseph and his drinker and his brothers because standing out from the crowd had its pros and its cons and jealousy created enemies and those he outshone such as the shadow people.": 1,
    " Now the shadow people didn't like the sunshine kid because he showed up the dark things the shadow people did and when he shone he showed the places where the shadow people hid so the shadow people had an evil plan to get rid of him first up.": 1,
    "They made fun of his sunspots.": 1,
    " and shooting his dreams from the sky, their words were gunshots designed to remind him": 1,
    " It wasn't very cool and didn't fit in with any popular kids at school, they said.": 1,
    "His head was up in space and it would bring him down to earth.": 1,
    "Essentially, he came from nothing and that's what he was worth.": 1,
    "He never gets to go to university to learn all the degrees he never showed.": 1,
    "He'd be the first degree burns from those.": 1,
    " They came too close.": 1,
    "Told him he was too bright.": 1,
    "That's why no one ever looked him in the eyes.": 1,
    "His judgment became clouded.": 1,
    "So did the sky with evaporated tears as the sun started to cry because the sunshine kid was bright.": 1,
    " with a warm personality, and inside he burnt savagely, hurt by the words and curses of the shadowy folk who spoke holes in his soul and left cavities, and as his heart hardened, his bark darkened.": 1,
    " Every time they called him names, it cooled his flames.": 1,
    "He thought they might like him if he kept his light dim, but they were busy turning lightning, so he had terrible aim.": 1,
    "He couldn't quite get to grips with what they said, so he let his light be eclipsed by what they said.": 1,
    " He fell into a lone star state like Texas and felt like he'd been punched in his solar plexus but that's when Little Miss Sunshine came along singing her favourite song about how we're made to be strong and you don't have to be wrong to belong just be true to who you are.": 1,
    " We were all stars at heart and Little Miss Sunshine was hot stuff.": 1,
    " The kind of girl when you looked at her, you forgot stuff.": 1,
    " But for him, there was no forgetting her.": 1,
    "The minute he saw her image burn in his retina, she was out of this world.": 1,
    "Yet she accepted him.": 1,
    "The thing about this girl meant he knew whenever she was next to him, things weren't as dark as they seemed.": 1,
    "He dared to dream.": 1,
    "Shadows weren't aware to be seen.": 1,
    "When she was there, he beamed and his eyes would light up.": 1,
    " in ways that can't be faked.": 1,
    "When she grinned, erased, erased the tip words of hate that gave each other nicknames, they were Cool Star and Fun Sun, and gradually the shadowy damage became undone.": 1,
    "She was one in a septillion.": 1,
    " And she was brilliant.": 1,
    "Could turn the coldest-blooded reptilians vermilion loved by billions from Chileans to Brazilians and tore the sunshine, keep the meaning of resilience, she said.": 1,
    " all the darkness in the world cannot put out the light from a single candle.": 1,
    "So how the hell could they handle your lights?": 1,
    "Only you can choose to dim it and the sky is the limit so silence the critics by burning.": 1,
    " And if eyes are windows to the soul and she drew back the curtains and let the sunshine through the hurting.": 1,
    " So in a universe of adversity, these stars stuck together.": 1,
    "And though days became nights, the memories would last forever.": 1,
    "Whether the weatherman said it or not, it would be fine.": 1,
    "Because if you're behind the clouds, the kid gets still shiniest.": 1,
    "The sunshine kid was bright.": 1,
    " with the warm personality and inside he burnt savagely, fuelled by the fire inspired across galaxies by the girl who showed him belief.": 1
