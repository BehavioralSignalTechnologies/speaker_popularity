    " I'm actually going to share something with you I haven't talked about probably in more than 10 years, so bear with me as I take you through this journey.": 1,
    "When I was 22 years old, I came home from work": 1,
    " put a leash on my dog and went for my usual run.": 1,
    " I had no idea that at that moment my life was going to change forever.": 1,
    "While I was preparing my dog for the run,": 1,
    " A man was finishing drinking at a bar, picked up his car keys, got into a car and headed south or wherever he was.": 1,
    " I was running across the street and the only thing that I actually remember is feeling like a grenade went off in my head.": 1,
    " And I remember putting my hands on the ground and feeling my life's blood emptying out of my neck and my mouth.": 1,
    " What had happened is he ran a red light and hit me, my dog.": 1,
    "She ended up underneath the car.": 1,
    " I flew out in front of the car and then he ran over my legs.": 1,
    "My left leg got caught up in the wheel well, spun it around.": 1,
    " The bumper of the car hit my throat, slicing it open.": 1,
    " I ended up with blunt chest trauma.": 1,
    "Your aorta comes up behind your heart.": 1,
    "It's your major artery and it was severed.": 1,
    "So my, my blood was gurgling out of my mouth and foamed and horrible things were happening to me.": 1,
    " I had no idea what was going on, but strangers intervened.": 1,
    " kept my heart moving, beating.": 1,
    "I say moving because it was quivering and they were trying to put a beat back into it.": 1,
    " Somebody was smart and put a big pen in my neck to open up my airway so that I could get some air in there and my lung collapsed so somebody cut me open and put a pen in there as well to open up my, to stop that.": 1,
    " catastrophic event from happening.": 1,
    " Somehow I ended up at the hospital.": 1,
    "I was wrapped in ice and then eventually put into a drug-induced coma.": 1,
    " 18 months later, I woke up.": 1,
    " I was blind, I couldn't speak and I couldn't walk.": 1,
    "I was 64 pounds.": 1,
    " The hospital really has no idea what to do with people like that.": 1,
    "In fact, they started to call me a gomer.": 1,
    "That's another story we won't even get into.": 1,
    " I had so many surgeries to put my neck back together to repair my heart a few times.": 1,
    "Some things worked, some things didn't.": 1,
    "I had lots of titanium put in me, cadaver bones to try to get my feet moving the right way.": 1,
    " And I ended up with a plastic nose, porcelain teeth, and all kinds of other things.": 1,
    "But eventually I started to look human again.": 1,
    " But...": 1,
    " Well, it's hard sometimes to talk about these things, so bear with me.": 1,
    " I had more than 50 surgeries, but who's counting?": 1,
    " So eventually the hospital decided it was time for me to go.": 1,
    "They needed to open up space for somebody else that they thought could could come back from whatever.": 1,
    " they were going through.": 1,
    "Everybody lost faith in me being able to recover.": 1,
    "So they basically put a map up on the wall, threw a dart, and it landed at a senior home here in Colorado.": 1,
    " And I know all of you are scratching your head, a senior citizens home, what in the world are you going to do there?": 1,
    "But if you think about all of the skills and talent that are in this room right now,": 1,
    " That's what a senior home has.": 1,
    "So there were all these skills and talents that these seniors had.": 1,
    "The one advantage that they had over most of you is wisdom because they had a long life.": 1,
    " And I needed that wisdom at that moment in my life.": 1,
    "But imagine what it was like for them when I showed up at their doorstep.": 1,
    "At that point, I had gained four pounds, so I was 68 pounds.": 1,
    "I was bald.": 1,
    " I was wearing hospital scrubs and somebody donated tennis shoes for me and I had a white cane in one hand and": 1,
    " and a suitcase full of medical records in another hand, and so the senior citizens realized that they needed to have an emergency meeting.": 1,
    " So they pulled back and they were looking at each other and they were going, okay, what skills do we have in this room?": 1,
    "This kid needs a lot of work.": 1,
    " So they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs.": 1,
    "But one of the first": 1,
    " things they needed to do was assess what I needed right away, which I needed to figure out how to eat like a normal human being since I'd been eating through a tube in my chest and then through my veins, and so I had to go through.": 1,
    " trying to eat again, and they went through that process.": 1,
    "And then they had to figure out, well, she needs furniture.": 1,
    " is sleeping in the corner of this apartment, so they went to their storage lockers and all gathered their extra furniture, gave me pots and pans, blankets.": 1,
    " everything.": 1,
    " And then the next thing that I needed was a makeover.": 1,
    " So out went the green scrubs and in came the polyester and floral prints.": 1,
    " We're not going to talk about the hairstyles that they tried to force on me once my hair grew back.": 1,
    "But I did say no to the blue hair.": 1,
    " So eventually what went on is they decided that, well, I need to learn to speak.": 1,
    "So you can't be an independent person if you're not able to speak and can't see.": 1,
    " So they figured not being able to see is one thing, but they need to get me to talk.": 1,
    "So while Sally, the office manager, was teaching me to speak in the day, you know, it's hard because I": 1,
    " you know when you're a kid you take things for granted you learn things unconsciously but for me I had to I was an adult and it was embarrassing and I had to learn how to coordinate my new throw with my tongue and my": 1,
    " new teeth and my lips and capture the air and get the word out.": 1,
    "So I acted like a two-year-old and refused to work.": 1,
    " But the men had a better idea.": 1,
    "They were going to make it fun for me.": 1,
    "So they were teaching me cuss word Scrapple at night.": 1,
    " Good.": 1,
    " and then secretly how to swear like a sailor.": 1,
    "So I'm going to just leave it to your imagination as to what my first words were.": 1,
    " when Sally finally got my confidence built.": 1,
    " So I moved on from there and a former teacher who happened to have Alzheimer's took on the task of teaching me to write.": 1,
    " The redundancy was actually good for me, so we'll just keep moving on.": 1,
    " One of the pivotal times for me was actually learning to cross the street again as a blind person.": 1,
    " So close your eyes.": 1,
    " Now imagine you have to cross a street.": 1,
    "You don't know how far that street is.": 1,
    " and you don't know if you're going straight, and you hear cars whizzing back and forth, and you had a horrible accident that landed you in this situation.": 1,
    "So there were two obstacles I had to get through.": 1,
    " One was post-traumatic stress disorder.": 1,
    " Every time I approached the corner or the curb, I would panic.": 1,
    "And the second one was actually trying to figure out how to cross that street.": 1,
    "So one of the seniors just came up to me and she": 1,
    " pushed me up to the corner and she said, when you think it's time to go, just stick the cane out there.": 1,
    "If it's hit, don't cross the street.": 1,
    " made perfect sense.": 1,
    " But by the third cane that went whizzing across the road,": 1,
    " They realized that they needed to put their resources together and they raised funds so that I could go to the Braille Institute and actually gain the skills to be a blind person and also to go get a guide dog who transformed my life.": 1,
    " And I was able to return to college because of the senior citizens who invested in me and also the guide dog and the skills that I had gained.": 1,
    " Ten years later I gained my sight back, not magically, and I opted in for three surgeries, and one of them was experimental.": 1,
    "It was actually a robotic surgery that removed a hematoma from behind my eye.": 1,
    " The biggest change for me was that the world moved forward.": 1,
    " that there were innovations in all kinds of new things, cell phones, laptops, all these things that I'd never seen before.": 1,
    "And as a blind person, your visual memory fades.": 1,
    " and is replaced with how you feel about things and how things sound and how things smell.": 1,
    " So one day I was in my room and I saw this thing sitting in my room and I thought it was a monster so I was walking around it and I go, I'm just going to touch it and I touched it and I went, oh my God, it's a laundry basket.": 1,
    " Everything is different when you're a sighted person because you take that for granted.": 1,
    "But when you're blind, you have the tactile memory for things.": 1,
    " The biggest change for me was looking down at my hands and seeing that I'd lost 10 years of my life.": 1,
    " I thought that time had stood still for some reason and moved on for family and friends but when I looked down I realized that time marched on for me too and that I needed to get caught up so I got going on it.": 1,
    " We didn't have words like crowdsourcing and radical collaboration when I had my accident, but the concept held true.": 1,
    "People working with people to rebuild me, people working with people to re-educate me.": 1,
    " I wouldn't be standing here today if it wasn't for extreme radical collaboration.": 1,
    "Thank you so much.": 1
