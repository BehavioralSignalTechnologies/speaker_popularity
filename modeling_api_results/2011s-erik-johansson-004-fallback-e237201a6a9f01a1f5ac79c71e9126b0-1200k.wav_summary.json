    " So, I'm here to share my photography.": 1,
    " Or is it photography?": 1,
    "Because, of course, this is a photograph that you can't take with your camera.": 1,
    "Yet my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15.": 1,
    " It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing, but it was a bit different.": 1,
    " Because using the camera, the process wasn't the planning instead.": 1,
    "When you take a photograph with the camera, the process ends when you press the trigger.": 1,
    " So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place at the right time.": 1,
    "I felt like anyone could do that.": 1,
    "So I wanted to create something different.": 1,
    "Something where the process starts when you press the trigger.": 1,
    " Photos like this.": 1,
    " construction going on along a busy road.": 1,
    "But it has an unexpected twist.": 1,
    "And despite that, it retains a level of realism.": 1,
    " or photos like these.": 1,
    " both dark and colorful, but all with the common goal of retaining the level of realism.": 1,
    " When I say realism, I mean photorealism because, of course,": 1,
    " It's not something you can capture really, but I always wanted to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph.": 1,
    "Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick.": 1,
    " So it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment, really.": 1,
    " But what's the trick that makes it look realistic?": 1,
    "Is it something about the details or the colors?": 1,
    "Is it something about the light?": 1,
    " What creates the illusion?": 1,
    " Sometimes the perspective is the illusion, but in the end it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.": 1,
    " It's not really what is realistic, it's what we think looks realistic.": 1,
    "I think the basics are quite simple.": 1,
    " I just see it as a puzzle of reality, where you just can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality.": 1,
    " And let me show you a simple example.": 1,
    " Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects, something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.": 1,
    "But combined in a certain way, they can create something that still looks three-dimensional, like it could exist.": 1,
    " but at the same time we know it can't.": 1,
    " So we trick our brains because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense.": 1,
    "And I see the same process with combining photographs.": 1,
    "It's just really about combining different realities.": 1,
    " So, the things that make a photograph look realistic, I think it's the things that we don't even think about, the things all around us in our daily lives.": 1,
    " But when combining photographs, this is really important to consider, because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.": 1,
    " So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result.": 1,
    " As you can see, these images aren't really special.": 1,
    "But combined, they can create something like this.": 1,
    " Hmm.": 1,
    " So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective.": 1,
    " Secondly, photos combined should have the same type of light.": 1,
    "And these two images both fulfill these two requirements, shot at the same height and in the same type of light.": 1,
    " The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end, by making it seamless.": 1,
    " make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed.": 1,
    " So by matching color, contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images, adding photographic defects like depth of field, desaturated colors and noise.": 1,
    " Erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image, despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers, basically.": 1,
    "So, here's another example.": 1,
    " One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what's manipulated.": 1,
    "But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations.": 1,
    " I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place than to find a place, because then you don't need to compromise with the ideas in your head.": 1,
    "But it does require a lot of planning.": 1,
    " And getting this idea during winter, I knew that I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations, the pieces for the puzzle basically.": 1,
    " So, for example, the fish is captured on a fishing trip.": 1,
    "The shores are from a different location.": 1,
    "The underwater part is captured in a stone pit.": 1,
    "I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish.": 1,
    " So to achieve a realistic result, I think it comes down to planning.": 1,
    "It always starts with a sketch, an idea.": 1,
    " then it's about combining the different photographs.": 1,
    "And here, every piece is very well planned.": 1,
    "And if you do a good job capturing the photos, the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic.": 1,
    " So all the tools are out there.": 1,
    " and the only thing that limits us.": 1,
    " is our imagination.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
