    " Hmm.": 1,
    " Bye.": 1,
    " I'll be right back.": 1,
    " Hey!": 1,
    " Hi everyone, I'm Serena and I'm 11 years old from Connecticut.": 1,
    " Well...": 1,
    " I'm not really sure why I'm here.": 1,
    " I mean, what does this have to do with technology, entertainment, design?": 1,
    " Well, I call my iPod, cell phone, and computer as technology, but this has nothing to do with that.": 1,
    "So, I did a little research on it.": 1,
    " Well, this is what I found.": 1,
    "Of course I hope I can memorize it.": 1,
    " Rally is basically made of a wood box and four metal strings.": 1,
    "By pulling the string, the string vibrates and produces a sound wave.": 1,
    "The sound wave passes through a piece of wood called a bridge and goes down to the wood box and gets amplified.": 1,
    "But, let me think.": 1,
    " Okay.": 1,
    "On the other hand, the place of your finger are different places on the fingerboard, change the string length, thus change the frequency of the sound wave.": 1,
    "Oh my gosh.": 1,
    "Okay.": 1,
    " This is sort of a technology, but I can call it a 16th century technology.": 1,
    " But actually the most fascinating thing that I found was that even the audio system and wave transmission nowadays are still basically based on the same principle of producing and projecting sound.": 1,
    "Isn't that cool?": 1,
    " I love its design.": 1,
    "I remember when I was little, my mom asked me, would you like to play the violin or the piano?": 1,
    "I looked at the giant monster and said to myself,": 1,
    " I am not going to lock myself on that bench the whole day.": 1,
    "This is a smart and right way that I can play from standing, sitting, or walking.": 1,
    "And you know what?": 1,
    "The best of all?": 1,
    " is that if I don't want to practice,": 1,
    " The violin is very beautiful.": 1,
    "Some people are related as the shape of a lady.": 1,
    "But whether I like it or not, it's been sold for more than 400 years.": 1,
    "And unlike modern stuff, they're easily looks dated.": 1,
    " But I think it's very personally unique that, although each violin looked pretty similar, that no two violins sound the same, even from the same maker or based on the same model.": 1,
    " Entertainment.": 1,
    "I love the entertainment.": 1,
    "But actually, the instrument itself isn't very entertaining.": 1,
    " I mean, when I first got my violin and tried to play around it, it was actually really bad because I didn't sound like the way I heard from other kids.": 1,
    "So horrible and so scratchy.": 1,
    " So, was it entertaining at all?": 1,
    " But besides, my brother found this very funny.": 1,
    " A few years later, I heard a joke about Greatest Violinist Yasha Heifetz.": 1,
    "After Mr. Heifetz's concert, a lady came over and complimented, Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violin sounded so great tonight.": 1,
    " Mr. Heif was a very cool person, so picked up his violin and said, funny, I don't hear anything.": 1,
    " And now I realize that as the musician, we human being, with our great mind, artistic heart, and skill, that can change the 16th century technology in a legendary design to a wonderful entertainment.": 1,
    " Now I know why I'm here.": 1,
    " Yeah.": 1,
    " Oh, oh, oh": 1,
    " I thought I was just going to be here just to perform, but unexpectedly I learned and enjoyed much more.": 1,
    " But...": 1,
    " Although, some of them were quite up there for me.": 1,
    " Like, the multi-dimension stuff.": 1,
    "I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough if I can actually get my two-dimension correct in school.": 1,
    " But actually the most impressive thing to me is that, well actually I would also like to stand this for all children, is to say thank you to all adults for actually caring for us a lot.": 1,
    " and to make our future world much better.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE": 1,
    " I'm out.": 1,
    " So, thank you.": 1,
