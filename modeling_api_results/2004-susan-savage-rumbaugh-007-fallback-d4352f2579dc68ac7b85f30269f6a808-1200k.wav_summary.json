    " I work with a species called bonobo, and I'm happy most of the time because I think this is the happiest species on the planet.": 1,
    " It's kind of a well-kept secret.": 1,
    "This species lives only in the Congo.": 1,
    "And they're not in too many zoos because of their sexual behavior.": 1,
    "Their sexual behavior is too human-like for most of us to be comfortable with.": 1,
    " Bye!": 1,
    " Actually, we have a lot to learn from them because they're a very egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society.": 1,
    " And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life that they sort of set aside.": 1,
    "It permeates their entire life.": 1,
    "And it's used for communication.": 1,
    "And it's used for conflict resolution.": 1,
    " And I think perhaps somewhere in our history, we sort of divided our life up into lots of parts.": 1,
    "We divided our world up with lots of categories.": 1,
    "And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit.": 1,
    " But I don't think we were that way initially.": 1,
    "There are many people who think that the animal world is hardwired and that there's something very, very special about man.": 1,
    " Maybe it's his ability to have causal thought.": 1,
    "Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to have language.": 1,
    " Maybe it's something special in his brain that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics.": 1,
    "Well, I don't know.": 1,
    "There were Tasmanians.": 1,
    " who were discovered around the 1600s and they had no fire.": 1,
    " They had no stone tools.": 1,
    "To our knowledge, they had no music.": 1,
    " So when you compare them to the bonobo,": 1,
    " The Manobo was a little hairier.": 1,
    " He doesn't stand quite as upright, but there are a lot of similarities.": 1,
    "And I think that as we look at culture,": 1,
    " we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are.": 1,
    "And I don't really think it's in our biology.": 1,
    " I think we've attributed it to our biology, but I don't really think it's there.": 1,
    "So what I want to do now is introduce you to a species called the bonobo.": 1,
    " This is Conzie.": 1,
    " He's a bonobo.": 1,
    "Right now, he's in a forest in Georgia.": 1,
    "His mother originally came from a forest in Africa.": 1,
    "And she came to us when she was just at puberty, about six or seven years of age.": 1,
    " Now this shows a bonobo on your right and a chimpanzee on your left.": 1,
    "Clearly the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking.": 1,
    " The bonobo, although shorter than us and their arms still longer, is more upright, just as we are.": 1,
    " This shows the bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy.": 1,
    "As you can see, there's not a lot of difference.": 1,
    " between the way Ebonobo walks and the way an early australopithecine would have walked.": 1,
    "As they turn toward us, you'll see that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter": 1,
    " and doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side.": 1,
    "So the gate, the bipedal gate, is a little easier.": 1,
    "And now we see all four.": 1,
    " The wild bonobo lives in central Africa, in the jungle encircled by the Congo River.": 1,
    " Canopied trees as tall as 40 meters, 130 feet, grow densely in the area.": 1,
    " It was a Japanese scientist who first undertook serious field studies of the bonobo almost three decades ago.": 1,
    " Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee.": 1,
    "Slim body.": 1,
    "Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures.": 1,
    " Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them.": 1,
    " One discovery was that wild bonobos often walk bipedally.": 1,
    " What's more, they are able to walk upright for long distances.": 1,
    " Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A-frame.": 1,
    " This is Kanji and I in the forest.": 1,
    "None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained.": 1,
    "None of them are tricks.": 1,
    "They all happen to be captured on film spontaneously by NHK of Japan.": 1,
    " We have eight bonobos, an entire family at our research center.": 1,
    " Gonna help get some sticks.": 1,
    " Good.": 1,
    " We need more sticks too.": 1,
    " I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one.": 1,
    " That's a wasp nest.": 1,
    "You can get it out.": 1,
    " Hope I have a lighter.": 1,
    "You can use the lighter to start the fire.": 1,
    " So Concie's very interested in fire.": 1,
    "He doesn't do it yet without a lighter, but I think if he saw someone do it, he might be able to make a fire without a lighter.": 1,
    " He's learning about how to keep a fire going.": 1,
    " is learning the uses for a fire.": 1,
    " just by watching what we do with fire.": 1,
    " This is a smile on the face of a bonobo.": 1,
    " We're very happy about this part.": 1,
    "You gotta put some water on the fire.": 1,
    "Do you see the water?": 1,
    " Good job.": 1,
    " I forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack.": 1,
    " But he likes to carry things from place to place.": 1,
    "He talks to other bonobos at the lab, long distance, farther than we can hear.": 1,
    " This is his sister.": 1,
    "This is her first time to try to drive a golf cart.": 1,
    " It's just awesome.": 1,
    " She's got the pedals down, but not the wheels.": 1,
    " She switches from reverse to forward.": 1,
    "She holds onto the wheel rather than turns.": 1,
    " Like us, she knows that that individual in the mirror is her.": 1,
    " by raising bonobos in a culture that is both bonobo and human and documenting their development across two decades.": 1,
    " Scientists are exploring how cultural forces may have operated during human evolution.": 1,
    " His name is Nyota.": 1,
    "It means star in Swahili.": 1,
    " We got to see the picture of him.": 1,
    "Pambanesha is trying to give in Yoda a haircut with a pair of scissors.": 1,
    " In the wild, the parent bonobo is known to groom its offspring.": 1,
    "Here, Pambinisha uses scissors instead of her hands to groom anyota.": 1,
    " Very impressive.": 1,
    " Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required to perform delicate tasks like this.": 1,
    " Nyota tries to imitate Panvinisha by using the scissors himself.": 1,
    " Realizing that Nyota might get hurt, Pambini, like any human mother, carefully tugs to get the scissors back.": 1,
    " He can now cut through tough animal hide.": 1,
    " Kanzi's learned to make stone tools.": 1,
    "Kanzi now makes his tools just as our ancestors may have made them two and a half million years ago by holding the rocks in both hands to strike one against the other.": 1,
    " He has learned that by using both hands and aiming his glancing blows, he can make much larger, sharper flanks.": 1,
    " Kanzi chooses a flag he thinks is sharp enough.": 1,
    " The tough hide is difficult to cut even with a knife.": 1,
    "The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard and ideal for stone tool making, but difficult to handle, requiring great skill.": 1,
    " Kanzi's rock is from Gona, Ethiopia and is identical to that used by our African ancestors two and a half million years ago.": 1,
    " These are the rocks Konzi used, and these are the flakes he made.": 1,
    "The flat sharp edges are like knife blades.": 1,
    " Compare them to the tools our ancestors used.": 1,
    "They bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's.": 1,
    " Pambanesha is longing to go for a walk in the woods.": 1,
    "She keeps staring out the window.": 1,
    " This is going to show something we didn't think they would do.": 1,
    "For several days now, Pambanesia has not been outside.": 1,
    " I normally talk about it, but... Then Parvidesha does something unexpected.": 1,
    " But since I'm advised not to do what I normally do I haven't told you that these apes have language.": 1,
    "It's a geometric language.": 1,
    "She takes a piece of chalk and begins writing something on the floor.": 1,
    "What is she writing?": 1,
    " She's also saying the name of that, of her voice.": 1,
    "Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again.": 1,
    "These are her symbols on her keyboard.": 1,
    " They speak when she touches it.": 1,
    "Ambenisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go.": 1,
    "A-frame represents a hut in the woods.": 1,
    "Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard.": 1,
    " Yeah.": 1,
    " Paminacea began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor.": 1,
    " Very nice.": 1,
    "Beautiful, Paminacea.": 1,
    " At first we didn't really realize what she was doing until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it.": 1,
    "This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods.": 1,
    "The curved line is very similar to the lexigram.": 1,
    " The next symbol Pamanisha writes represents collar.": 1,
    "It indicates the collar Pamanisha must wear when she goes out.": 1,
    "That's an institutional requirement.": 1,
    " This symbol is not as clear as the others, but one can see Pambanesia is trying to produce a curved line and several straight lines.": 1,
    " Researchers began to record what Pambanesha said by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk.": 1,
    "Pambanesha watched.": 1,
    "Soon she began to write as well.": 1,
    " The bonobos' abilities have stunned scientists around the world.": 1,
    "How did they develop?": 1,
    "We found that the most important thing for permitting bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them.": 1,
    " it's simply to use language around them.": 1,
    "Because the driving force in language acquisition is to understand what others that are important to you are saying to you.": 1,
    " Once you have that capacity, the ability to produce language comes rather naturally and rather freely.": 1,
    " So we want to create an environment in which bonobos like all of the individuals with whom they're interacting.": 1,
    "We want to create an environment in which they have fun and an environment in which the others are meaningful individuals for them.": 1,
    " This environment brings out unexpected potential in Kanzi and Pambanisha.": 1,
    " Pamanitia is enjoying playing her harmonica until Anyoda, now one year old, steals it.": 1,
    " Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth.": 1,
    "Is he looking for where the sound came from?": 1,
    "Dr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish.": 1,
    " This time, Pambanesha is playing the electric piano.": 1,
    "She wasn't forced to learn the piano.": 1,
    "She saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest.": 1,
    " Beep beep": 1,
    " Oh": 1,
    " you": 1,
    " Go ahead.": 1,
    "Go ahead.": 1,
    "I'm listening.": 1,
    " Do that real fast part that you did.": 1,
    "Yeah, that part.": 1,
    " Kanzi plays the xylophone.": 1,
    "Using both hands, he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue's singing.": 1,
    " Kanzi and Pambanesha are stimulated by this fun-filled environment, which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities.": 1,
    " I'm sorry.": 1,
    " Okay, now get the monsters.": 1,
    " and take the cherries too.": 1,
    " Now watch out, stay away from them now.": 1,
    " Now you can chase him again.": 1,
    "Time to chase him.": 1,
    " Now you have to stay away, get away, run away, run.": 1,
    "Now we can chase them again.": 1,
    " Go get him.": 1,
    " Oh no!": 1,
    "It's good.": 1,
    "It's very good.": 1,
    "Thank you so much.": 1,
    " None of us, bonobo or human, can possibly even imagine": 1,
    " So we have a bi-species environment.": 1,
    "We call it a pan-homo culture.": 1,
    "We're learning how to become like them.": 1,
    "We're learning how to communicate with them in really high-pitched tones.": 1,
    " We're learning that they probably have the language in the wild.": 1,
    "And they're learning to become like us.": 1,
    "Because we believe that it's not biology, it's culture.": 1,
    "So we're sharing tools and technology and language with another species.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
