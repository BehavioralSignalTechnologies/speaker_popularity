    " that I'm going to tell you about why I became a sculptor.": 1,
    "And you may think that sculptors": 1,
    " Well, they deal with matter, they deal with objects, they deal with bodies, but I think": 1,
    " Really, what I care about most is making space and that's what I've called this talk, making space.": 1,
    " space that exists within us and without us.": 1,
    " So when I was a child, I don't know how many of you grew up in the 50s, but I was sent upstairs for an enforced rest.": 1,
    " That's a really bad idea.": 1,
    "I mean after lunch you're six and you want to go and climb a tree.": 1,
    " but I had to go upstairs this tiny little room that was actually made out of an old balcony, so it was incredibly hot, small, and light, and I had to lie there.": 1,
    " It was ridiculous.": 1,
    "But anyway, for some reason, I promised myself that I wasn't going to move, that I was going to do this thing that Mummy wanted me to do.": 1,
    " And then I was lying there in this tiny space, hot, dark, claustrophobic, matchbox size behind my eyes.": 1,
    " But it was really weird, like after this went on for days, weeks, months, that space would get bigger and darker and cooler.": 1,
    " until I really look forward to that half an hour of enforced immobility and rest.": 1,
    "And I really look forward to going to that place of darkness.": 1,
    " Do you mind if we do something completely different?": 1,
    "Can we all just close our eyes for a minute?": 1,
    "This isn't going to be freaky.": 1,
    "It isn't some cultic thing.": 1,
    "It's just I just would like us all to go there.": 1,
    "So I'm going to do it too.": 1,
    "We'll all be there together.": 1,
    "So close your eyes for a minute.": 1,
    " Here we are in a space, the subjective collective space of the darkness of the body.": 1,
    " I think of this as the place of imagination.": 1,
    " of potential.": 1,
    " But what are its qualities?": 1,
    "It is objectless.": 1,
    "There are no things in it.": 1,
    "It is dimensionless.": 1,
    "It is limitless.": 1,
    "It is": 1,
    " Endless.": 1,
    " Okay, open your eyes.": 1,
    " That's the space that I think sculpture, which is a bit of a paradox, sculpture that is about making material propositions, but I think that's the space.": 1,
    " that sculpture can connect us with.": 1,
    "So imagine we're in the middle of America.": 1,
    "You're asleep.": 1,
    " You wake up and without lifting your head from the earth on your sleeping bag, you can see for 70 miles.": 1,
    " This is a dry lake bed.": 1,
    " I was young.": 1,
    "I'd just finished art school.": 1,
    "I wanted to do something that was working directly with the world.": 1,
    " directly with place.": 1,
    "This was a wonderful place because it was a place where you could imagine that you were the first person to be there.": 1,
    "It was a place where nothing very much had happened.": 1,
    " Anyway, bear with me.": 1,
    "I picked up a hand-sized stone, threw it as far as I was able.": 1,
    "That was about 22 meters.": 1,
    "I then cleared": 1,
    " all the stones within that radius and made a pile.": 1,
    "That was the pile, by the way.": 1,
    "And then I stood on the pile.": 1,
    " and threw all of those rocks out again.": 1,
    " And here is rearranged desert.": 1,
    " You could say, well, it doesn't look very different from when he started.": 1,
    " what's all the fuss about?": 1,
    "In fact, Chris was worried and said, look, don't show them that slide because they're just going to think you're another one of those crazy modern artists who doesn't do much.": 1,
    " But the fact is, this is evidence of a living body on other bodies.": 1,
    " rocks that have been the subject of geological formation, erosion, the action of time on objects.": 1,
    " This is a place in a way that I just would like you to in a way look at differently because of this event that has happened in it, a human event.": 1,
    " And in general, it just asks us to look again at this world so different from, in a way, the world that we have been sharing with each other, the technological world.": 1,
    " to look again at the elemental world.": 1,
    " the elemental world that we all live in.": 1,
    " is that space that we all visited together, the darkness of the body.": 1,
    " I wanted to start again with that environment, the environment of the intimate subjective space that each of us lives in, but from the other side of appearance.": 1,
    " So here is a daily activity of the studio.": 1,
    "You can see I don't do much.": 1,
    "I'm just standing there, again with my eyes closed.": 1,
    "And other people are molding me, evidential.": 1,
    " This is an indexical register of a lived moment of a body in time.": 1,
    " Can we map that space using the language of neutrinos or cosmic rays, taking the bounding condition of the body as its limit?": 1,
    " but in complete reversal of, in a way, the most traditional Greek idea of pointing.": 1,
    "In the old days, they used to take a lump of pentallic marble and drill from the surface in order to identify the skin.": 1,
    " The appearance.": 1,
    "What Aristotle defined as the distinction between substance and appearance.": 1,
    "The thing that makes things visible.": 1,
    "But here we're working from the other side.": 1,
    " Or can we do it as an exclusive membrane?": 1,
    "This is a lead case made around": 1,
    " the space that my body occupied, but it's now void.": 1,
    "This is a work called Learning to See.": 1,
    " a bit of, well, we could call it night, we could call it the 96% of gravity that we don't know about, dark matter.": 1,
    " placed in space anyway another version of a human space in space at large but I don't know if you can see the eyes are": 1,
    " indicated, they're closed.": 1,
    "It's called learning to see because it's about an object that hopefully works reflexively and talks about that vision or connection": 1,
    " with the darkness of the body that I see as a space of potential.": 1,
    " Can we do it another way, using the language of particles around a nucleus and talk about the body as an energy center, no longer about statues, no longer having to take": 1,
    " that duty of standing, the standing of a human body or the standing of a statue, release it.": 1,
    "Allow it to be an energy field, a space in space that talks about human life": 1,
    " between becoming an entropy as a sort of concentration of attention, a human place of possibility in space at large.": 1,
    " Is there another way?": 1,
    " dark matter now placed against the horizon.": 1,
    " If minds live in bodies, if bodies live in clothes and then in rooms and then in buildings and then in cities.": 1,
    " Do they also have a final skin, and is that skin perceptual?": 1,
    " the horizon.": 1,
    " And is art about trying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon?": 1,
    " Can we use, in a way, a body as an empty catalyst for a kind of empathy?": 1,
    " with the experience of space-time as it is lived, as I am standing here in front of you.": 1,
    " trying to feel and make a connection in this space-time that we are sharing, can we use, as it were, the memory of a body?": 1,
    " of a human space in space to catalyze an experience, again, first-hand experience of elemental time.": 1,
    " human time, industrial time, tested against the time of the tides in which these memories of": 1,
    " a particular body that could be any body multiplied as in the time of mechanical reproduction many times": 1,
    " placed over three square miles, a mile out to sea, disappearing in different conditions of day and night.": 1,
    "You can see this work, it's on the mouth of the Mersey.": 1,
    " just outside Liverpool.": 1,
    "And there you can see what a Liverpool sea looks like on a typical afternoon.": 1,
    " The pieces appear and disappear.": 1,
    "But maybe more importantly, this is just looking north from the center of the installation.": 1,
    " they create a field, a field that involves living and these surrogate bodies in a kind of relation.": 1,
    " a relation with each other and a relation with that limit, the edge, the horizon.": 1,
    " Just moving on, is it possible taking that idea of mind, body, body building to": 1,
    " supplant the first body, the biological body, with the second, the body of architecture and the built environment.": 1,
    "This is a work called Room for the Great Australian Desert.": 1,
    " It's at an undefined location and I've never published where it is.": 1,
    "It's an object for the mind.": 1,
    "I think of it as a 21st century Buddha.": 1,
    " Again, the darkness of the body now held within this bunker shape of the minimum position that a body needs to occupy, a crouching body.": 1,
    " There's a hole at the anus, penis level.": 1,
    "There are holes at the ears.": 1,
    "There are no holes at the eyes.": 1,
    "There's a slot for the mouth.": 1,
    " It's two and a half inches thick concrete with a void interior.": 1,
    "Again, a site found with a completely flat 360 degree horizon.": 1,
    " This is just simply asking again, as if we had arrived for the first time, what is the relationship of the human project to time and space?": 1,
    " taking that idiom of, as it were, the darkness of the body transferred to architecture.": 1,
    " Can you use architectural space not for living but as a metaphor and use its systolic, diastolic": 1,
    " smaller and larger spaces to provide a kind of first-hand somatic narrative for a journey through space, light and darkness.": 1,
    " This is a work of some proportion and some weight that makes the body into a city, an aggregation of cells that are all interconnected.": 1,
    " and that allow certain visual access at certain places.": 1,
    " V.": 1,
    " Last word that I just wanted to share with you is blind light, which is perhaps": 1,
    " the most open work and in a conference of radical openness I think maybe this is as radical as I get using light and water vapor as my materials.": 1,
    "Here is a box.": 1,
    " filled at one and a half atmosphere of atmospheric pressure with a cloud and with very bright light.": 1,
    "As you walk towards the ever open threshold, you disappear.": 1,
    " both to yourselves and to others.": 1,
    "If you hold your hand out in front of you, you can't see it.": 1,
    "If you look down, you can't see your feet.": 1,
    " You are now consciousness without an object, freed from the dimension full and measured": 1,
    " way in which life links us to the obligatory.": 1,
    " But this is a space that is actually filled with people.": 1,
    " disembodied voices and out of that ambient environment when people come close to your own body zone, very close, they appear to you as representations.": 1,
    " When they appear close to the edge, they are representations, representations in which the viewers have become the viewed.": 1,
    " For me, art is not about objects of high monetary exchange.": 1,
    "It's about re-asserting our first-hand experience in present time.": 1,
    " As John Cage said,": 1,
    " We are not moving towards some kind of goal.": 1,
    "We are at the goal, and it is changing with us.": 1,
    " If art has any purpose, it is to open our eyes to that fact.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
