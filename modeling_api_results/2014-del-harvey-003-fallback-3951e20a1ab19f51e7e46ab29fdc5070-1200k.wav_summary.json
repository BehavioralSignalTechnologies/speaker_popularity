    " My job at Twitter is to ensure user trust, protect user rights, and keep users safe, both from each other and at times from themselves.": 1,
    " Let's talk about what scale looks like at Twitter.": 1,
    " Back in January 2009, we saw more than 2 million new tweets each day on the platform.": 1,
    "January 2014, more than 500 million.": 1,
    " We were seeing two million tweets in less than six minutes.": 1,
    "That's a 24,900% increase.": 1,
    " Now, the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way.": 1,
    "There's no risk involved.": 1,
    "My job is to root out and prevent activity that might.": 1,
    " Sounds straightforward, right?": 1,
    "You might even think it'd be easy given that I just said the vast majority of activity on Twitter puts no one in harm's way.": 1,
    " Why spend so much time searching for potential calamities and innocuous activities?": 1,
    " Given the scale that Twitter is at, a one in a million chance happens 500 times a day.": 1,
    " It's the same for other companies dealing at this sort of scale.": 1,
    "For us, edge cases, those rare situations that are unlikely to occur, are more like norms.": 1,
    " Say 99.999% of tweets pose no risk to anyone.": 1,
    "There's no threat involved.": 1,
    "Maybe people are": 1,
    " documenting travel landmarks like Australia's Heart Reef or tweeting about a concert they're attending or sharing pictures of cute baby animals.": 1,
    " After you take out that 99.999%, that tiny percentage of tweets remaining works out to roughly 150,000 per month.": 1,
    " The sheer scale of what we're dealing with makes for a challenge.": 1,
    "You know what else makes my role particularly challenging?": 1,
    " People do weird things.": 1,
    " And I have to figure out what they're doing, why, and whether or not there's risk involved, often without much in terms of context or background.": 1,
    " I'm going to show you some examples that I've run into during my time at Twitter.": 1,
    "These are all real examples of situations that at first seemed cut and dried, but the truth of the matter was something altogether different.": 1,
    " Details have been changed to protect the innocent and sometimes the guilty.": 1,
    " We'll start off easy.": 1,
    " If you saw a tweet that only said this, you might think to yourself, that looks like abuse.": 1,
    "After all, why would you want to receive the message, yo, bitch?": 1,
    " Now, I try to stay relatively hip to the latest trends and memes, so I knew that yo bitch": 1,
    " was also often a common greeting between friends as well as being a popular Breaking Bad reference.": 1,
    " I will admit that I did not expect to encounter a fourth use case.": 1,
    "It turns out it is also used on Twitter when people are role playing as dogs.": 1,
    " And in fact, in that case, it's not only not abusive, it's technically just an accurate greeting.": 1,
    " So okay, determining whether or not something is abusive without context, definitely hard.": 1,
    "Let's look at spam.": 1,
    " Here's an example of an account engaged in classic spammer behavior, sending the exact same message to thousands of people.": 1,
    "While this is a mock-up I put together using my account, we see accounts doing this all the time.": 1,
    " Seems pretty straightforward.": 1,
    "We should just automatically suspend accounts engaging in this kind of behavior.": 1,
    " Turns out there's some exceptions to that rule.": 1,
    "Turns out that that message could also be a notification you signed up for that the International Space Station is passing overhead because you wanted to go outside and see if you could see it.": 1,
    " You're not going to get that chance if we mistakenly suspend the account thinking it's spam.": 1,
    " Okay, let's make the stakes higher.": 1,
    "Back to my account, again exhibiting classic behavior.": 1,
    "This time it's sending the same message and link.": 1,
    " This is often indicative of something called phishing, somebody trying to steal another person's account information by directing them to another website.": 1,
    " That's pretty clearly not a good thing.": 1,
    "We want to and do suspend accounts engaging in that kind of behavior.": 1,
    "So why are the stakes higher for this?": 1,
    " Well, this could also be a bystander at a rally who managed to record a video of a police officer beating a nonviolent protester who's trying to let the world know what's happening.": 1,
    " We don't want to gamble on potentially silencing that crucial speech by classifying it as spam and suspending it.": 1,
    " That means we evaluate hundreds of parameters when looking at account behaviors.": 1,
    "And even then, we can still get it wrong and have to reevaluate.": 1,
    " Now, given the sorts of challenges I'm up against, it's crucial that I not only predict but also design protections for the unexpected.": 1,
    " And that's not just an issue for me or for Twitter, it's an issue for you.": 1,
    "It's an issue for anybody who's building or creating something that you think is going to be amazing and will let people do awesome things.": 1,
    "So what do I do?": 1,
    " I pause and I think.": 1,
    " How could all of this go horribly wrong?": 1,
    " I visualize catastrophe.": 1,
    " And that's hard.": 1,
    "There's a sort of inherent cognitive dissonance in doing that.": 1,
    "Like when you're writing your wedding vows at the same time as your prenuptial agreement.": 1,
    " But you still have to do it, particularly if you're marrying 500 million tweets per day.": 1,
    " What do I mean by visualized catastrophe?": 1,
    "I try to think of how something is, say, benign and innocuous as a picture of a cat could lead to death and what to do to prevent that, which happens to be my next example.": 1,
    " This is my cat, Eli.": 1,
    "We wanted to give users the ability to add photos to their tweets.": 1,
    "A picture's worth a thousand words, you only get 140 characters, you add a photo to your tweet, look at how much more content you've got now.": 1,
    " There's all sorts of great things you can do by adding a photo to a tweet.": 1,
    "My job isn't to think of those.": 1,
    "It's to think of what could go wrong.": 1,
    " How could this picture lead to my death?": 1,
    " Well, here's one possibility.": 1,
    "There's more in that picture than just a cat.": 1,
    " There's geodata.": 1,
    "When you take a picture with your smartphone or digital camera, there's a lot of additional information saved along in that image.": 1,
    "In fact, this image also contains the equivalent of this, more specifically, this.": 1,
    " Sure, it's not likely that someone's going to try to track me down and do me harm based upon image data associated with a picture I took of my cat, but I start by assuming the worst will happen.": 1,
    " That's why when we launched photos on Twitter, we made the decision to strip that geodata out.": 1,
    " If I start by assuming the worst and work backwards, I can make sure that the protections we build work for both expected and unexpected use cases.": 1,
    "Given that I spend my days and nights imagining the worst that could happen,": 1,
    " It wouldn't be surprising if my worldview was gloomy.": 1,
    " It's not.": 1,
    "The vast majority of interactions I see, and I see a lot, believe me, are positive.": 1,
    "People reaching out to help or to connect or share information with each other.": 1,
    " It's just that for those of us dealing with scale, for those of us tasked with keeping people safe, we have to assume the worst will happen.": 1,
    "Because for us, a one in a million chance": 1,
    " pretty good odds.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
