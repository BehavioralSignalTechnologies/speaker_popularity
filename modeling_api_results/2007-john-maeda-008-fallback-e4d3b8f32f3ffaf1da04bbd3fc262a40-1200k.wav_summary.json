    "I'm not sure.": 2,
    " on simplicity.": 1,
    "What a great way to start.": 1,
    " First of all, I've been watching this trend where we have these books like such and such for dummies.": 1,
    "Do you know these books, such and such for dummies?": 1,
    "My daughter's pointing out that I'm very similar looking, so this is kind of a problem.": 1,
    " I was looking online at Amazon.com for other books like this.": 1,
    "You know, there's also something called the Complete Idiots Guide.": 1,
    "There's a sort of a business model around being stupid in some sense.": 1,
    "We like to have technology make us feel bad for some strange reason.": 1,
    " But I don't really like that, so I wrote a book called The Laws of Simplicity.": 1,
    "I was in Milan last week for the Italian launch.": 1,
    "It's kind of a book about questions, questions about simplicity.": 1,
    "Very few answers.": 1,
    "I'm also wondering myself, what is simplicity?": 1,
    "Is it good?": 1,
    " Is it bad?": 1,
    "Is complexity better?": 1,
    "After I wrote the laws of simplicity, I was very tired of simplicity, as you can imagine.": 1,
    "And so in my life, I discovered that vacation is the most important skill for any kind of overachiever.": 1,
    " because your companies will always take away your life, but they can never take away your vacation, in theory.": 1,
    " I went to the Cape last summer to hide from simplicity, and I went to the Gap because I only had black pants.": 1,
    "I went and bought khaki shorts, whatever.": 1,
    "And unfortunately, their branding was all about keep it simple.": 1,
    " I opened up a magazine.": 1,
    "Visa's branding was business takes simplicity.": 1,
    "I developed photographs and Codex said keep it simple.": 1,
    "So I felt kind of weird.": 1,
    "The simplicity was sort of following me around.": 1,
    " So I turned on the TV.": 1,
    "And I don't watch TV very much, but you know this person?": 1,
    "This is Paris Hilton, apparently.": 1,
    "And she has this show, The Simple Life.": 1,
    "So I watched this.": 1,
    "It's not very simple, a little bit confusing.": 1,
    "So I thought about...": 1,
    " I looked for a different show to watch, so I opened up this TV Guide thing, and on the E!": 1,
    "channel, this SimpliCity, this Simple Life show is very popular.": 1,
    "They'll play it over and over and over.": 1,
    " So it was traumatizing, actually.": 1,
    "So I wanted to escape again, so I went in my car.": 1,
    "And Cape Cod, very idyllic roads, and all of us can drive in this room.": 1,
    " And when you drive, these signs are very important.": 1,
    "It's a very simple sign.": 1,
    "It says road and a road approaching, so I was driving along okay, and then I saw this sign.": 1,
    "I was scared.": 1,
    " So I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly.": 1,
    "So I thought, ah, simplicity, very important.": 1,
    "But then I thought, well, simplicity, what would that be like on the beach?": 1,
    "What if the sky was 41% gray?": 1,
    "Wouldn't that be the perfect sky?": 1,
    " It's a simplicity sky.": 1,
    "But in reality, the sky looked like this.": 1,
    "It was a beautiful complex sky.": 1,
    "You know, the pinks and blues.": 1,
    "We can't help but love complexity.": 1,
    "Human beings, we love complex things.": 1,
    "We love relationships.": 1,
    "Very complex.": 1,
    "So we love this kind of stuff.": 1,
    " I'm at this place called the Media Lab.": 1,
    "Maybe some of you guys have heard of this place.": 1,
    "It's designed by IM Pei, one of the premier modernist architects.": 1,
    "Modernism means white box, and it's a perfect white box.": 1,
    " Some of you guys are entrepreneurs, et cetera, whatever.": 1,
    "Last month I was at Google, and boy, that cafeteria, man.": 1,
    "You guys have things here in Silicon Valley like stock options.": 1,
    "See, in academia, we get titles.": 1,
    " Lots of titles.": 1,
    "Last year at TED, these were my titles.": 1,
    "I had a lot of titles.": 1,
    "I have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters.": 1,
    "This year at TED, I'm happy to report that I have new titles in addition to my previous titles.": 1,
    " I'm another associate director of research.": 1,
    "And I also, this also happened also, I have five daughters now.": 1,
    "That's my baby Raina.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " And so my life is much more complex because of the baby actually, but that's okay.": 1,
    "We will still stay married I think but looking way back": 1,
    " Back when I was a child, I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.": 1,
    "Many of you may not like tofu because you haven't had good tofu, but tofu is a good food.": 1,
    "It's a very simple kind of food.": 1,
    "It's very hard work to make tofu.": 1,
    " As a child, we used to wake up at 1 a.m.": 1,
    "and work till 6 p.m., six days a week.": 1,
    "My father was kind of like Andy Grove, this sort of, for the paranoid of the competition, so often seven days a week.": 1,
    " Family business equals child labor.": 1,
    "We were a great model.": 1,
    "But so I love going to school.": 1,
    "School was great.": 1,
    "And maybe going to school helped me get to this Media Lab place.": 1,
    " So the Media Lab is an interesting place and it's important to me because as a student I was a computer science undergrad and I discovered design later on in my life and there was this person": 1,
    " Meryl Cooper, who knows Meryl Cooper?": 1,
    "Meryl Cooper, wasn't she amazing?": 1,
    "Meryl Cooper, she was wacky.": 1,
    "And she was a Tedster, exactly.": 1,
    "And she showed us, she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again.": 1,
    " And she's very important in my life because she's the one that told me to leave MIT and go to art school.": 1,
    "It was the best advice I ever got.": 1,
    "So I left art school because of her.": 1,
    "She passed away in 1994.": 1,
    " And I was hired back to MIT to try to fill her shoes, but it's so hard.": 1,
    " When I was in Japan, I went to art school in Japan, I had a nice sort of situation because somehow I was connected to Paul Rand.": 1,
    "Some of you guys know Paul Rand, the greatest graphic designer.": 1,
    "I'm sorry out there.": 1,
    " The graphic designer Paul Rand designed the IBM logo, the Westinghouse logo.": 1,
    "He basically said, I've designed everything.": 1,
    "And also,": 1,
    " Iko Tanaka was a very important mentor in my life, the Paul Rand of Japan.": 1,
    "He designed most of the major icons of Japan, like Issey Miyake's brand, and also Muji.": 1,
    "When you have mentors,": 1,
    " Yesterday, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar talked about mentors, these people in your life, probably mentors that they'll die.": 1,
    "This is a sad thing.": 1,
    " But it's actually a happy thing in a way, because you can remember them in their pure form.": 1,
    "I think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us.": 1,
    " and we get older, you're all freaked out, whatever, the mentors calm us down and I'm grateful for my mentors and I'm sure all of you are too.": 1,
    " because the human thing is very hard when you're at MIT.": 1,
    "The T doesn't stand for human.": 1,
    "It stands for technology.": 1,
    "And because of that, I was wondering about this": 1,
    " human thing.": 1,
    "So I've always been Googling this word human to find out how many hits I get.": 1,
    "In 2001, I had 26 million hits.": 1,
    "And for a computer, because computers against human a bit, I have 42 million hits.": 1,
    "Let me do an Al Gore here.": 1,
    " So if you sort of compare that like this, you'll see that computer versus human, I was tracking this last year.": 1,
    " Computer versus human over the last year has changed.": 1,
    "It used to be kind of two to one.": 1,
    "Now, humans are catching up very good as humans.": 1,
    "We're catching up to computers.": 1,
    " In the simplicity realm, it's also interesting.": 1,
    "So if you compare complexities to simplicity, it's also catching up in a way too.": 1,
    "So somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined, I think.": 1,
    " I have a confession.": 1,
    "I'm not a man of simplicity.": 1,
    "I spent my entire early career making complex stuff.": 1,
    "Lots of complex stuff.": 1,
    "I wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this.": 1,
    "I had clients in Japan to make really complex stuff like this.": 1,
    " And I've always felt bad about it in a sense.": 1,
    "So I hid in the time dimension.": 1,
    "I built things in the time graphics dimension.": 1,
    "I did this series of calendars for Shiseido.": 1,
    "This is a floral themed calendar in 1997.": 1,
    " And this is a firework calendar.": 1,
    "So you launch the number into space because Japanese believe that when you see fireworks, you're cooler for some reason.": 1,
    " This is why they have fireworks in summer for extreme culture.": 1,
    "Lastly, this is a fall-based calendar because I have some of my leaves in my yard.": 1,
    "So this is the leaves in my yard, essentially.": 1,
    " And so I made a lot of these types of things.": 1,
    "I've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things.": 1,
    "And so I made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes.": 1,
    "I feel kind of bad about that.": 1,
    " Tomorrow, Paula Antonelli speaking.": 1,
    "I love Paula.": 1,
    "She has this show right now at MoMA where I have my, some of these early works are here on display at MoMA on the walls.": 1,
    "If you're in New York, please go and see that.": 1,
    " But I've had a problem because I make all this flying stuff and people say, oh, I know your work.": 1,
    "You're the guy that makes eye candy.": 1,
    " And when you're told this, you feel kind of weird, eye candy, sort of pejorative, don't you think?": 1,
    "So I say instead, no, I make eye meat instead.": 1,
    "And eye meat is something different, something more fibrous, something more powerful percepts.": 1,
    "But what could that be?": 1,
    "Eye meat.": 1,
    " I've been interested in computer programs all my life, actually.": 1,
    "Computer programs are essentially trees.": 1,
    "And when you make art with a computer program, there's kind of a problem.": 1,
    "Whenever you make art with a computer program, you're always on the tree.": 1,
    " And the paradox is that for real excellent art, you want to be off the tree.": 1,
    "So this is the sort of the complication I found.": 1,
    " So, to get off the tree, I began to use my old computers.": 1,
    "I took these to Tokyo in 2001 to make computer objects.": 1,
    "This is a new way to type.": 1,
    "I'm an old color classic.": 1,
    " You can't type very much on this.": 1,
    "I also discovered that a IR mouse responds to CRT emissions and starts to move by itself.": 1,
    "So this is a self-drawing machine.": 1,
    " And also, one year, the G3 Bondi Blue thing, that caddy would come out like dangerous, like whack, like that.": 1,
    "So I thought, this is very interesting.": 1,
    "What if I make it like a car crash test?": 1,
    "So I have it crash test.": 1,
    " Instead of measuring the impact, stuff like this are things I made just to sort of understand what these things are.": 1,
    " Shortly after this 9-11 happened, I was very depressed.": 1,
    "I was concerned with contemporary art that was all about piss and sort of really sad things.": 1,
    "And so I wanted to think about something happy.": 1,
    "So I focused on food as my area.": 1,
    " You know, these sort of clementine peel things.": 1,
    "In Japan, it's a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel just in one piece.": 1,
    "Who's done that before?": 1,
    "One piece clementine?": 1,
    "You guys are missing out if you haven't done it yet.": 1,
    " It's very good.": 1,
    "And I discovered that I can make sculptures out of this, actually, in different forms.": 1,
    "If you dry them correctly, you can make elephants and spheres and stuff.": 1,
    "My wife didn't like these because they mold, so I just stopped that.": 1,
    " So I went back to the computer and I bought five large fries and scanned them all.": 1,
    "And I was looking for some kind of food theme and I wrote some software to automatically lay out French fry images.": 1,
    " And as a child I'd hear that song, you know, oh beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grains.": 1,
    "I made this amber waves image.": 1,
    "It's sort of a Midwest cornfield out of french fries.": 1,
    " And also, as a child, I was the fattest kid in class, so I used to love Cheetos.": 1,
    "Oh, I love Cheetos.": 1,
    "Yummy.": 1,
    "So I wanted to play with Cheetos in some way.": 1,
    "I wasn't sure where to go with this.": 1,
    "I invented Cheeto Paint.": 1,
    " Cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with Cheetos.": 1,
    "I discovered that Cheetos are good expressive material.": 1,
    " And with these Cheetos, I began to think, what can I make with these Cheetos?": 1,
    "And so I began to crinkle up potato chip flakes and also pretzels.": 1,
    "I was looking for some kind of form, and in the end, I made 100 butter fries.": 1,
    "Did you get it?": 1,
    " And each butterfly is composed of different pieces.": 1,
    "People ask me how they make the antenna.": 1,
    "Sometimes they find hair in food.": 1,
    "That's my hair.": 1,
    " My heart's clean, it's okay.": 1,
    "I'm a tenured professor, which means basically I don't have to work anymore.": 1,
    "It's a strange business model.": 1,
    "I can come into work every day and staple five pieces of paper and just stare it over my latte.": 1,
    " End of story.": 1,
    "But I realized that life could be very boring.": 1,
    "So I've been thinking about life and I noticed that my camera, my digital camera versus my car, very strange thing.": 1,
    " The car is so big, the camera is so small, yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual.": 1,
    "Doesn't make any sense.": 1,
    " So I was in a cape one time, and I typed right through the word simplicity, and I discovered in this weird M. Night Shyamalan way that I just have letters M-I-T.": 1,
    " In the word simplicity and complexity, MIT occur in perfect sequence.": 1,
    "That's a bit eerie, isn't it?": 1,
    "So maybe I'll do this for the next 20 years or something.": 1,
    " And I wrote this book, Laws of Simplicity.": 1,
    "It's a very short, simple book.": 1,
    "There are ten laws and three keys.": 1,
    "The ten laws and three keys, I won't go over them because that's why I have a book and also that's why it's on the web for free.": 1,
    " But the laws are kind of like sushi in a way.": 1,
    "They're all kinds.": 1,
    "In Japan, they say that sushi is challenging.": 1,
    "You know, the uni is the most challenging, so number 10 is challenging.": 1,
    "People hate number 10, like they hate uni actually.": 1,
    " The three keys are easy to eat.": 1,
    "This is anago, cooked already, so easy to eat.": 1,
    "So enjoy your sushi meal later with the laws of simplicity.": 1,
    "Because I want to simplify them for you, because that's what this is about.": 1,
    "I have to simplify this thing.": 1,
    " So, if I simplify the laws of simplicity, I have what's called the cookie versus laundry thing.": 1,
    " Anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid a big cookie or a small cookie, which cookie are they going to take?": 1,
    "The big cookie.": 1,
    "You can say the small cookie has Godiva chocolate bits in it, but it doesn't work.": 1,
    "They want the big cookie.": 1,
    " But, if you offer kids two piles of laundry to fold, the small pile or the big pile, which will they choose?": 1,
    "Strangely, not the big pile.": 1,
    " So I think it's as simple as this.": 1,
    "When you want more, it's because you want to enjoy it.": 1,
    "When you want less, it's because it's about work.": 1,
    " And so to boil it all down, simplicity is about living life with more enjoyment and less pain.": 1,
    "I think this is a sort of simple more versus less.": 1,
    "Basically, it always depends.": 1,
    " This book I wrote because I wanted to figure out life.": 1,
    "I love life.": 1,
    "I love being alive.": 1,
    "I like to see things.": 1,
    "And so life is a big question, I think, in simplicity, because you're trying to simplify your life.": 1,
    " And I just love to see the world.": 1,
    "The world is an amazing place.": 1,
    "By being at TED, we see so many things at one time.": 1,
    "And I can't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world, like everything you see, everything you wake up.": 1,
    "It's such a joy to sort of experience": 1,
    " Everything in the world, from everything from a weird hotel lobby to Saran wrap placed over your window to this moment where I had my road in front of my house paved dark black and this white moth was sitting there dying in the sun.": 1,
    " And so this whole thing has struck me as exciting to be here because life is finite.": 1,
    "This is given to me by the chairman of Shiseido.": 1,
    "He's expert in aging.": 1,
    "This horizontal axis is how old you are, 12 years old, 24 year old.": 1,
    " 74, 96 years old.": 1,
    "And this is some medical data.": 1,
    "So brain strength increases up to 60.": 1,
    "And then after 60, it sort of goes down.": 1,
    "Kind of depressing in a way.": 1,
    " Also, if you look at your physical strength, I have a lot of cocky freshmen at MIT, so I tell them, oh, your body is really getting stronger and stronger, but in your late 20s, mid 30s, cells say die.": 1,
    "I guess they'll work harder sometimes.": 1,
    " And if you have your vision, the vision is interesting.": 1,
    "As you age, from infant age, your vision gets better and maybe in your late teens, early twenties, you're looking for a mate and your vision goes after that.": 1,
    "It's probably good.": 1,
    " Your social responsibility is very interesting.": 1,
    "So as you get older, you may have kids, whatever, and then the kids graduate and you have no responsibility anymore.": 1,
    "It's very good, too.": 1,
    " But if any people ask, what actually goes up?": 1,
    "Does anything go up?": 1,
    "What's a positive part of this?": 1,
    "I think wisdom always goes up.": 1,
    "I love these 80-year-old, 90-year-old guys and women.": 1,
    "They have so many thoughts and they have so much wisdom.": 1,
    " And I think, you know, this Ted thing, I've come here, I guess, this is the fourth time.": 1,
    "And I come here for this wisdom, I think.": 1,
    "I mean, this whole Ted effect, I think, is, it sort of ups your wisdom somehow.": 1,
    " And I'm so glad to be here, and I'm very grateful to be here, Chris, and this is an amazing experience for me as well.": 1
