    " Well, I'm involved in other things besides physics.": 1,
    "In fact, mostly now in other things.": 1,
    "One thing is distant relationships among human languages.": 1,
    " And the professional historical linguists in the US and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away from any long distance relationships.": 1,
    " big groupings, groupings that go back a long time, longer than the familiar families.": 1,
    "They don't like that.": 1,
    "They think it's crank.": 1,
    "I don't think it's crank.": 1,
    " And there's some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians, who are working on that at the Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow.": 1,
    " And I would love to see where that leads.": 1,
    "Does it really lead to a single ancestor some 20, 25,000 years ago?": 1,
    "And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor?": 1,
    " when there was presumably a competition among many languages, how far back does that go?": 1,
    "How far back does modern language go?": 1,
    "How many tens of thousands of years does it go back?": 1,
    " Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is?": 1,
    "Well, I would guess that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay of the caves.": 1,
    " in Western Europe in the Org Nation period, some 35,000 years ago or earlier.": 1,
    "I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have modern language.": 1,
    " So I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further.": 1,
    "But that doesn't mean that all or many or most of today's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps from one that's much younger than that.": 1,
    " like say 20,000 years or something of that kind.": 1,
    "It's what we call a bottleneck.": 1,
    " Well, Philip Anderson may have been right.": 1,
    "You may just know more about everything than anyone.": 1,
    "So it's been an honor.": 1,
    "Thank you, Murray.": 1
