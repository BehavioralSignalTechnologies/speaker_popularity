    " I have stage fright.": 1,
    "I've always had stage fright.": 1,
    "And not just a little bit.": 1,
    "It's a big bit.": 1,
    "And it didn't even matter until I was 27.": 1,
    "That's when I started writing songs.": 1,
    "And even then,": 1,
    " I only played them for myself.": 1,
    "Just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable.": 1,
    " But after a couple years, just writing songs wasn't enough.": 1,
    "I had all these stories and ideas, and I wanted to share them with people.": 1,
    "But physiologically, I couldn't do it.": 1,
    "I had this irrational fear.": 1,
    " But the more I wrote and the more I practiced, the more I wanted to perform.": 1,
    "So on the week of my 30th birthday, I decided I was going to go to this local open mic and put this fear behind me.": 1,
    "And when I got there, it was packed.": 1,
    "There were like 20 people there.": 1,
    " And they all looked angry.": 1,
    " But I took a deep breath and I signed up to play and I felt pretty good.": 1,
    "Pretty good until about 10 minutes before my turn when my whole body rebelled and this wave of anxiety just washed over me.": 1,
    " Now when you experience fear, your sympathetic nervous system kicks in.": 1,
    "So you have a rush of adrenaline.": 1,
    "Your heart rate increases, your breathing gets faster.": 1,
    "Next, your non-essential systems start to shut down, like digestion.": 1,
    " So your mouth gets dry and blood is routed away from your extremities so your fingers don't work anymore.": 1,
    "Your pupils dilate, your muscles contract, your spidey sense tingles.": 1,
    "Basically, your whole body is trigger happy.": 1,
    " That condition.": 1,
    " is not conducive to performing folk music.": 1,
    "I mean, your nervous system is an idiot.": 1,
    "Really, 200,000 years of human evolution, and it still can't tell the difference between a saber-toothed tiger and 20 folk singers on a Tuesday night open mic.": 1,
    " I have never been more terrified until now.": 1,
    " So then it was my turn, and somehow I get myself onto the stage, I start my song, I open my mouth to sing the first line, and this completely horrible vibrato, you know, when your voice wavers.": 1,
    " come streaming out.": 1,
    "And this is not the good kind of vibrato like an opera singer has.": 1,
    "This is my whole body just convulsing with fear.": 1,
    "I mean, it's a nightmare.": 1,
    "I'm embarrassed.": 1,
    "The audience is clearly uncomfortable.": 1,
    "They're focused on my discomfort.": 1,
    "It was so bad.": 1,
    " But that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter.": 1,
    "And something good did happen.": 1,
    "I had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that I was hoping for.": 1,
    "And I wanted more, but I knew I had to get past this nervousness.": 1,
    " That night I promised myself I would go back every week until I wasn't nervous anymore.": 1,
    "And I did.": 1,
    "I went back every single week.": 1,
    "And sure enough, week after week,": 1,
    " It didn't get any better.": 1,
    "The same thing happened every week.": 1,
    "I couldn't shake it.": 1,
    "And that's when I had an epiphany.": 1,
    "And I remember it really well because I don't have a lot of epiphanies.": 1,
    " All I had to do was write a song that exploits my nervousness.": 1,
    "That only seems authentic when I have stage fright.": 1,
    "And the more nervous I was, the better the song would be.": 1,
    " So I started writing a song about having stage fright.": 1,
    "First, fessing up to the problem, the physical manifestations, how I would feel, how the listener might feel.": 1,
    " and then accounting for things like my shaky voice and I knew I would be singing about a half octave higher than normal because I was nervous.": 1,
    " By having a song that explained what was happening to me, while it was happening, that gave the audience permission to think about it.": 1,
    "They didn't have to feel bad for me because I was nervous.": 1,
    "They could experience that with me.": 1,
    "And we were all one big, happy, nervous, uncomfortable family.": 1,
    " by thinking about my audience, by embracing and exploiting my problem.": 1,
    "I was able to take something that was blocking my progress and turn it into something that was essential for my success.": 1,
    " And having the stage fright song let me get past that biggest issue right in the beginning of a performance.": 1,
    "And then I can move on and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease.": 1,
    " And eventually, you know, over time I didn't have to play the stage fright song at all.": 1,
    " except for when I was really nervous.": 1,
    "Like now.": 1,
    " Would it be okay if I played the stage fright song for you?": 1,
    " Can I have a sip of water?": 1,
    " I'm not joking, you know, this stage fright is real": 1,
    " And if I'm up here trembling and singing Well you'll know how I feel And the mistake I'd be making": 1,
    " The tremolo caused by my whole body shaking As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me Well you don't have to be Well maybe just a little bit": 1,
    " And maybe I'll try to imagine you all without clothes.": 1,
    " But singing in front of all naked strangers scares me more than anyone knows.": 1,
    "Not to discuss the sublains.": 1,
    " But my body image was never my strength.": 1,
    "So frankly I wish that you all would get dressed.": 1,
    "I mean, you're not even really naked.": 1,
    " And I'm the one with the problem.": 1,
    " And you tell me don't worry so much, you'll be great": 1,
    " But I'm the one living with me and I know how I get Your advice is gentle but late": 1,
    " If not just a bit patronizing And that sarcastic tone doesn't help me when I sing": 1,
    " We shouldn't talk about these things right now Really I'm up on stage and you're in the crowd": 1,
    " And I'm not making fun of a nurtured rational": 1,
    " If I wasn't ready to face this, I sure as hell wouldn't be here.": 1,
    "But if I belt one note out clearly,": 1,
    " You'll know I'm recovering slowly but surely And maybe next week I'll set my guitar ringing My voice clear as water and everyone's singing": 1,
    " But probably I'll just get up and start groovin' My vocal cords movin' at speeds slightly faster than sound": 1
