    " It is very fashionable and proper to speak about food in all its forms, all its colors, aromas and tastes.": 1,
    " But after the food goes through the digestive system,": 1,
    " When it is thrown out as crap, it is no more fashionable to speak about it.": 1,
    "It's rather revolting.": 1,
    " I'm a guy who was graduated from bullshit to full shit.": 1,
    " My organization, Gramvikas, which means Village Development Organization, was working in the area of renewable energy.": 1,
    "On most part, we were producing biogas.": 1,
    " biogas for rural kitchens.": 1,
    " We produce biogas in India by using animal manure.": 1,
    " which usually in India is called cow dung, but in a gender sensitive person that I am, I would like to call it bullshit.": 1,
    " But realizing later on how important was sanitation and disposal of crap in a proper way, we went into the arena of sanitation.": 1,
    " 80% of all diseases in India and most developing countries is because of poor quality water.": 1,
    " And when we look at the reason for poor quality water, you find that it is our abysmal attitude to the disposal of human waste.": 1,
    " Human waste in its rawest form Finds its way back to drinking water bathing water washing water irrigation water whatever water you see": 1,
    " And this costs for 80% of the diseases in rural areas.": 1,
    " In India, it is unfortunately...": 1,
    " only the women who carry water.": 1,
    "So for all domestic needs, women have to carry water.": 1,
    " So that is a pitiful state of affairs.": 1,
    " Open defecation is rampant.": 1,
    "70% of India defecates in the open.": 1,
    " They sit there out in the open with the wind on their sails, hiding their faces, exposing their bases, and sitting there in pristine glory.": 1,
    " Yeah, 70% of India.": 1,
    "And if you look at the world total, 60% of all the crap that is thrown into the open are by Indians.": 1,
    " a fantastic distinction.": 1,
    "I do not know if we Indians can be proud of such a distinction.": 1,
    " So we, together with a lot of villages, we began to talk how to really address this situation of sanitation.": 1,
    "And we came together and formed": 1,
    " a project called Mandra.": 1,
    "Mandra stands for movement and action network for transformation of rural areas.": 1,
    "So we are speaking about transformation.": 1,
    " Transformation in rural areas.": 1,
    " village which agrees to implement this project, they organize a legal society where the general body consists of all members who elect a group of men and women": 1,
    " who implement the project and later on who look after the operation and maintenance.": 1,
    "They decide to build a toilet": 1,
    " and a shower room.": 1,
    "And from a protected water source, water would be brought to an elevated water reservoir and piped to all households through three taps.": 1,
    " One in the toilet, one in the shower, one in the kitchen.": 1,
    "24 hours a day.": 1,
    " The pity is that our cities like New Delhi, Bombay, do not have 24 hours water supply.": 1,
    "But in these villages, we want to have": 1,
    " There's a distinct difference in the quality.": 1,
    " Well, India, we have": 1,
    " a theory which is very much accepted by the government, bureaucracy, and all those who matter, that poor people deserve poor solutions.": 1,
    " And absolutely poor people deserve pathetic solutions.": 1,
    " And this combined with a noble price-worthy theory that cheapest is the most economic is the heavy cocktail that the poor are forced to drink.": 1,
    " We are fighting against this.": 1,
    "We feel that the poor have been humiliated for centuries and": 1,
    " even in sanitation they should not be humiliated.": 1,
    "Sanitation is more about dignity than about human disposal of waste.": 1,
    "And so you build these toilets and very often we have to hear": 1,
    " that the toilets are better than their houses and you can see in front is attached houses and there is the toilet.": 1,
    "So these people": 1,
    " Without a single exception of a family in a village, decide to build a toilet, a bathing room.": 1,
    " And for that, they come together, collect all the local materials, local materials like rubble, sand, aggregates.": 1,
    " Usually a government subsidy is available to meet at least part of the cost of external materials like cement, steel, toilet, commode.": 1,
    " and they built a toilet and a bathing room.": 1,
    " Also, all the unskilled laborers, that is daily wage earners, mostly landless, are given an opportunity to be trained as masons and plumbers.": 1,
    " So, while these people are being trained, others are collecting the materials.": 1,
    "And when both are ready, they build a toilet, a shower room, and of course, also a": 1,
    " water tower, an elevated water reservoir.": 1,
    "We use a system of two leach pits to treat the waste.": 1,
    "From the toilet, the muck comes into the first leach pit.": 1,
    " And when it is full, it is blocked and it can go to the next.": 1,
    "But we discovered that if you plant banana trees, papaya trees on the periphery of these leech pits,": 1,
    " They grow very well because they suck all the nutrients.": 1,
    "And you get very tasty bananas, papayas.": 1,
    " If anyone of you come to my place, I would be happy to share these bananas and papayas with you.": 1,
    " So you can see the completed toilets, the water towers.": 1,
    "This is in a village where most of the people may be even illiterate.": 1,
    " It is always 24 hours water supply because water gets polluted very often when you store it.": 1,
    "A child dips his or her hand into it, something falls into it.": 1,
    " No water is stored, it's always on tap.": 1,
    " This is how elevated water reservoir is constructed, and that is the end product.": 1,
    "Because it has to go high,": 1,
    " and there is some space available.": 1,
    "Two or three rooms are made under the water tower, which is used by the village for different committee meetings.": 1,
    "We have had clear evidence": 1,
    " of great impact of this program.": 1,
    " Before we started, there were, as usual, more than 80% of the people were suffering from waterborne diseases.": 1,
    "But after this, we have empirical evidence": 1,
    " that 82% on an average among all these villages, 1,200 villages have completed, 82% of the waterborne diseases have come down.": 1,
    " Women usually used to spend especially in summer months.": 1,
    " about": 1,
    " six to seven hours a day.": 1,
    " carrying water.": 1,
    " And when they went for carrying water, because as I said earlier,": 1,
    " It's only women who carry water there.": 1,
    "They used to take their little children, girl children also to carry water or else to be back at home to look after the siblings.": 1,
    " So there was less than 9% of girl children attending school, even if there was a school, and boys about 30%.": 1,
    " but girls it has gone to about 90% and boys almost to 100%.": 1,
    " The most vulnerable section in a village are the landless laborers who are the daily wage earners.": 1,
    "Because they have gone through this training to be masons and plumbers and barbenders,": 1,
    " Now their ability to earn has increased 300 to 400 percent.": 1,
    " So this is a democracy in action because there is a general body, the governing board, the committee, people are questioning, people are governing themselves, people are learning to manage their own affairs.": 1,
    " They are taking their own futures into their hands.": 1,
    "And that is democracy at the grassroot level in action.": 1,
    " More than 1,200 villages have so far done this.": 1,
    " It benefits over 400,000 people, and it's still going on.": 1,
    "And I hope.": 1,
    " it continues to move ahead.": 1,
    " For India and such developing countries, armies and armaments": 1,
    " software companies.": 1,
    " and spaceships.": 1,
    " may not be as important as taps and toilets.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
