    " a huge opportunity unleashing of new potential for innovation, for development.": 1,
    "But there's an underbelly.": 1,
    "There are two Achilles' heels of globalization.": 1,
    " There's the Achilles heel of growing inequality, those that are left out, those that feel angry, those that are not participating.": 1,

    "The other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen on genetics.": 1,
