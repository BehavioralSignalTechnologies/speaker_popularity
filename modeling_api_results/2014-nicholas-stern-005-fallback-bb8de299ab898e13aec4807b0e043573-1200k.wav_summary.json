    " We're at a remarkable moment in time.": 1,
    " we face, over the next two decades, two fundamental transformations that will determine whether the next 100 years is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries.": 1,
    "Let me illustrate with an example.": 1,
    " I first visited Beijing 25 years ago to teach at the People's University of China.": 1,
    "China was getting serious about market economics and about university education.": 1,
    " So they decided to call in the foreign experts.": 1,
    " Like most other people, I moved around Beijing by bicycle.": 1,
    "Apart from dodging the occasional vehicle, it was a safe and easy way to get around.": 1,
    "Cycling in Beijing now is a completely different prospect.": 1,
    " The roads are jammed by cars and trucks.": 1,
    "The air is dangerously polluted from the burning of coal and diesel.": 1,
    "When I was there last in the spring, there was an advisory for people of my age": 1,
    " over 65, to stay indoors and not move much.": 1,
    "How did this come about?": 1,
    "It came from the way in which Beijing has grown as a city.": 1,
    " It's doubled over those 25 years, more than doubled, from 10 million to 20 million.": 1,
    "It's become a sprawling urban area dependent on dirty fuel, dirty energy, particularly coal.": 1,
    " China burns half the world's coal each year and that's why it is a key reason why it is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases.": 1,
    "At the same time,": 1,
    " we have to recognize that in that period, China has grown remarkably.": 1,
    "It's become the world's second-largest economy.": 1,
    "Hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty.": 1,
    "That's really important.": 1,
    "But at the same time,": 1,
    " the people of China are asking the question, what's the value of this growth if our cities are unlivable?": 1,
    "They've analyzed, diagnosed that this is an unsustainable path of growth and development.": 1,
    " China's planning to scale back coal.": 1,
    "It's looking to build its cities in different ways.": 1,
    " Now, the growth of China is part of a dramatic change, fundamental change, in the structure of the world economy.": 1,
    "Just 25 years ago, the developing countries, the poorer countries of the world, were part": 1,
    " notwithstanding being the vast majority of the people, they're counted for only about a third of the world's output.": 1,
    " Now it's more than half, 25 years from now.": 1,
    "It'll probably be two thirds from the countries that we saw as 25 years ago as developing.": 1,
    " That's a remarkable change.": 1,
    "It means that most countries around the world, rich or poor, are going to be facing the two fundamental transformations that I want to talk about and highlight.": 1,
    " Now the first of these transformations is the basic structural change of the economies and societies that have already begun to illustrate through the description of Beijing.": 1,
    " percent now in urban areas.": 1,
    "That's going to go to 70 percent in 2050.": 1,
    "Over the next two decades, we'll see the demand for energy rise by 40 percent, and the growth in the economy and in the population": 1,
    " is putting increasing pressure on our land, on our water and on our forests.": 1,
    "This is profound structural change.": 1,
    "If we manage it in a negligent or a short-sighted way,": 1,
    " we will create waste, pollution, congestion, destruction of land and forests.": 1,
    "If we think of those three areas that I've illustrated with my numbers, cities,": 1,
    " energy, land.": 1,
    "If we manage all that badly, then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods of the people around the world would be poor and damaged.": 1,
    "And more than that, the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise.": 1,
    " with immense risks to our climate.": 1,
    "Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are already": 1,
    " higher than they've been for millions of years.": 1,
    "If we go on increasing those concentrations, we risk temperatures over the next century or so that we have not seen on this planet for tens of millions of years.": 1,
    " We've been around as homo sapiens, with a rather generous definition, sapiens.": 1,
    "For perhaps a quarter of a million years, a quarter of a million, we've risked temperatures we haven't seen for tens of millions of years, over a century.": 1,
    " That would transform the relationship between human beings and the planet.": 1,
    " It would lead through changing deserts, changing rivers, changing patterns of hurricanes, changing sea levels, hundreds of millions of people.": 1,
    " perhaps billions of people who would have to move.": 1,
    "And if we've learned anything from history, that means severe and extended conflict.": 1,
    "And we couldn't just turn it off.": 1,
    " You can't make a peace treaty with the planet.": 1,
    "You can't negotiate the laws of physics.": 1,
    "You're in there.": 1,
    "You're stuck.": 1,
    "Those are the stakes we're playing for.": 1,
    "And that's why we have to make this second transformation, the climate transformation, and move to the low-carbon economy.": 1,
    " Now the first of these transformations is going to happen anyway.": 1,
    "We have to decide whether to do it well or badly, the economic or structural transformation.": 1,
    "But the second of the transformations, the climate transformations, we have to decide to do.": 1,
    " Those two transformations face us in the next two decades.": 1,
    "The next two decades are decisive for what we have to do.": 1,
    " Now, the more I've thought about this, the two transformations coming together, the more I've come to realize that this is an enormous opportunity.": 1,
    "It's an opportunity which we can use.": 1,
    " or it's an opportunity which we can lose.": 1,
    "And let me explain through those three key areas that I've identified, cities, energy and land.": 1,
    "Let me start with cities.": 1,
    " I've already described the problems of Beijing, of pollution, congestion, waste and so on.": 1,
    "Surely we recognize that in many of our cities around the world.": 1,
    " Now with cities like life, but particularly cities, you have to think ahead.": 1,
    " the cities that are going to be built, and there are many, and many big ones, we have to think of how to design them in a compact way.": 1,
    " so we can save travel time and we can save energy.": 1,
    "The cities that already are there, well established.": 1,
    "We have to think about renewal and investment in them so that we can connect ourselves much better.": 1,
    " within those cities and make it easier, encourage more people to live closer to the centre.": 1,
    " We've got examples building around the world of the kinds of ways in which we can do that.": 1,
    "The bus rapid transport system in Bogot\u00e1, in Colombia, is a very important case of how to move around safely and quickly and non-polluting way.": 1,
    " in the city.": 1,
    "Very frequent buses, strongly protected routes, the same service really as an underground railway system, but much, much cheaper and can be done much more quickly.": 1,
    "A brilliant idea.": 1,
    " in many more cities around the world that's developing.": 1,
    "Now, some things in cities do take time.": 1,
    "Some things in cities can happen much more quickly.": 1,
    "Take my hometown, London.": 1,
    " In 1952, smog in London killed 4,000 people and badly damaged the lives of many, many more.": 1,
    "And it happened all the time.": 1,
    " than those of you who live outside London in the UK will remember it used to be called the smoke.": 1,
    "That's the way London was.": 1,
    "By regulating coal, within a few years, the problems of smoke were rapidly reduced.": 1,
    "I remember the smogs well.": 1,
    " when the visibility dropped to more than a few meters, they stopped the buses and I had to walk.": 1,
    "This was 1950s.": 1,
    "I had to walk home three miles from school.": 1,
    "Again, breathing was a hazardous": 1,
    " activity, but it was changed.": 1,
    "It was changed by decision.": 1,
    "Good decisions can bring good results, striking results, quickly.": 1,
    "We've seen more.": 1,
    "In London, we've introduced the congestion charge, actually quite quickly and effectively.": 1,
    " and we've seen great improvements in the bus system and cleaned up the bus system.": 1,
    "You can see that the two transformations I've described, the structural and the climate, come very much together.": 1,
    " But we have to invest.": 1,
    "We have to invest in our cities, and we have to invest wisely.": 1,
    "And if we do, we'll see cleaner cities.": 1,
    " quieter cities, safer cities, more attractive cities, more productive cities, and stronger community in those cities.": 1,
    "Public transport, recycling, reusing, all sorts of things that bring communities together.": 1,
    " We can do that, but we have to think, we have to invest, we have to plan.": 1,
    "Let me turn to energy.": 1,
    " energy over the last 25 years has increased by about 50 percent.": 1,
    "Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels.": 1,
    "Over the next 20 years, perhaps it'll increase by another 40 percent or so.": 1,
    " We have to invest strongly in energy.": 1,
    "We have to use it much more efficiently and we have to make it clean.": 1,
    "We can see how to do that.": 1,
    "Take the example of California would be in the top 10 countries in the world if it was": 1,
    " independence.": 1,
    "I don't want to start any...": 1,
    " California's a big place.": 1,
    " In the next five or six years, they will likely move from around 20 percent in renewables, wind, solar and so on, to over 33 percent.": 1,
    " And that would bring California back to greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 to where they were in 1990, a period when the economy of California would more or less have doubled.": 1,
    " That's a striking achievement, shows what can be done.": 1,
    "Not just California, the incoming government of India is planning to get solar technology to light up the homes of 400 million people who don't have electricity in India.": 1,
    " They've set themselves a target of five years.": 1,
    "I think they've got a good chance of doing that.": 1,
    "We'll see.": 1,
    "But what you're seeing now is people moving much more quickly, 400 million, more than the population of the United States.": 1,
    " Those are the kinds of ambitions now people are setting themselves in terms of rapidity of change.": 1,
    "Again, you can see ...": 1,
    " Good decisions can bring quick results, and those two transformations, the economy and the structure and the climate, the low carbon, are": 1,
    " intimately intertwined.": 1,
    "Do the first one well, the structural, the second one on the climate becomes much easier.": 1,
    "Look at land.": 1,
    " land and particularly forests.": 1,
    "Forests are the hosts to valuable plant and animal species.": 1,
    "They hold water in the soil and they take carbon dioxide": 1,
    " out of the atmosphere, fundamental to the tackling of climate change.": 1,
    "But we're losing our forests.": 1,
    "In the last decade, we've lost a forest area the size of Portugal, and much more has been degraded.": 1,
    " But we're already seeing that we can do so much about that.": 1,
    " We can recognize the problem, but we can also understand how to tackle it.": 1,
    "In Brazil, the rate of deforestation has been reduced by 70 percent over the last 10 years.": 1,
    " How?": 1,
    "By involving local communities, investing in their agriculture and their economies, by monitoring more carefully, by enforcing the law more strictly.": 1,
    " And it's not just stopping deforestation, that's of course the first and fundamental importance.": 1,
    "But it's also regrading degraded land, regenerating, rehabilitating degraded land.": 1,
    " I first went to Ethiopia in 1967.": 1,
    "It was desperately poor.": 1,
    "In the following years, it suffered devastating famines and profoundly destructive social conflict.": 1,
    "Over the last few years, actually more than a few.": 1,
    " Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly.": 1,
    "It has ambitions to be a middle-income country 15 years from now and to be carbon neutral.": 1,
    "Again, I think it's a strong ambition, but it is a plausible one.": 1,
    " You're seeing that commitment there.": 1,
    "You're seeing what can be done.": 1,
    "Ethiopia is investing in clean energy.": 1,
    "It's working in the rehabilitation of land.": 1,
    " In Humbo, in southwest Ethiopia, a wonderful project to plant trees on degraded land and work with local communities on sustainable forest management has led to big increases in living standards.": 1,
    "So we can see.": 1,
    " from Beijing to London, from California to India, from Brazil to Ethiopia.": 1,
    "We do understand.": 1,
    " how to manage those two transformations, the structural and the climate.": 1,
    "We do understand how to manage those well.": 1,
    " And technology is changing very rapidly.": 1,
    "I don't have to list all those things to an audience like this, but you can see the electric cars, you can see the batteries.": 1,
    " using new materials.": 1,
    "You can see that we can manage remotely now our household appliances on our mobile phones when we're away.": 1,
    "You can see better insulation, and there's much more coming.": 1,
    "But, and it's a big but.": 1,
    " The world as a whole is moving far too slowly.": 1,
    "We're not cutting emissions in the way we should.": 1,
    "We're not managing those structural transformations as we can.": 1,
    " The depth of understanding of the immense risks of climate change are not there yet.": 1,
    " the depth of understanding of the attractiveness of what we can do is not there yet.": 1,
    " We need political pressure to build.": 1,
    "We need leaders to step up.": 1,
    " We can have better growth, better climate, a better world.": 1,
    " we can make.": 1,
    " by managing those two transformations well, the next 100 years, the best of centuries.": 1,
    "If we make a mess of it, we, you and me, if we make a mess of it, if we don't manage those transformations properly, it will be.": 1,
    " The next 100 years will be the worst of centuries.": 1,
    "That's the major conclusion of the report on the economy and climate.": 1,
    " chaired by ex-president Felipe Calderon of Mexico, and I co-chaired that with him.": 1,
    "And we handed that report yesterday here in New York, in the United Nations building, to the Secretary General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon.": 1,
    " We know that we can do this.": 1,
    " Now, two weeks ago I became a grandfather for the fourth time.": 1,
    " Our daughter...": 1,
    " Our daughter gave birth to Rosa here in New York two weeks ago.": 1,
    "Here are Helen and Rosa.": 1,
    " two weeks old.": 1,
    " Are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye?": 1,
    " and tell them that we understood the issues.": 1,
    " that we recognize the dangers and the opportunities and still we fail to act.": 1,
    " Surely not.": 1,
    "Let's make the next 100 years the best of centuries.": 1
