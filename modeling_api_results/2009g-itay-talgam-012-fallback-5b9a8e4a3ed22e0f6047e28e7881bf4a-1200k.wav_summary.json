    " the magical moment, the magical moment of conducting, which is you go onto the stage, there's an orchestra sitting, they're all warming up and doing stuff.": 1,
    " I go on the podium, you know, this little office of a conductor, or rather a cubicle, an open space cubicle with a lot of space.": 1,
    " And in front of all that noise, you do a very small gesture, something like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated.": 1,
    "This.": 1,
    "And suddenly, out of the chaos, order.": 1,
    "Noise becomes music.": 1,
    " And this is fantastic and it's so tempting to think that it's all about me.": 1,
    " All those great people here, they make noise, they need me to do that.": 1,
    "Not really.": 1,
    "If it were that, I would just...": 1,
    " save you the talk and teach you the gesture.": 1,
    "So you could go out of the world and do this in whatever company or whatever you want and you have perfect harmony.": 1,
    "It doesn't work.": 1,
    " Let's look at the first video.": 1,
    "I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony and then speak a little bit about how it comes about.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " Was that nice?": 1,
    "So if that was a sort of a success, now who should we thank for the success?": 1,
    " Obviously the orchestra musicians play beautifully, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.": 1,
    "They don't often even look at the conductor.": 1,
    " And then you have the clapping audience actually taking part in doing the music.": 1,
    "You know, Viennese audiences usually don't interfere the music.": 1,
    "This is the closest to an oriental belly dancing feast that you ever get in Vienna.": 1,
    " Unlike, for example, in Israel where audiences cough all the time.": 1,
    "You know, Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, used to say that anywhere in the world, people that have the flu, they go to a doctor.": 1,
    "In Tel Aviv, they come to my concerts.": 1,
    " So that's just a sort of a tradition.": 1,
    "But Viennese audiences do not do that.": 1,
    " But here they go out of the regular, just to be part of that, to become part of the orchestra.": 1,
    "And that's great, audiences like you make the event.": 1,
    " But what about the conductor?": 1,
    "What can you say the conductor was doing, actually?": 1,
    "He was...": 1,
    " Happy.": 1,
    "And I often show this, you know, senior management, people get annoyed.": 1,
    "You come to work, how come you're so happy?": 1,
    " Something must be wrong there, yeah?": 1,
    "But he's spreading happiness.": 1,
    "And I think happiness, the important thing is this happiness does not come from only his own story and his joy of the music.": 1,
    " The joy is about enabling other people's stories to be heard at the same time.": 1,
    "You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.": 1,
    "You have the story of the audience as a community.": 1,
    " You have the stories of the individuals in the orchestra and in the audience.": 1,
    "And then you have other stories unseen.": 1,
    "People who built this wonderful concert hall.": 1,
    "People who made those...": 1,
    " study values, amati, all those beautiful instruments.": 1,
    "And all those stories are being heard at the same time.": 1,
    "This is the true experience of a live concert.": 1,
    "That's a reason to go out of home.": 1,
    " But not all conductors do just that.": 1,
    "Let's see somebody else.": 1,
    "A great conductor.": 1,
    "Riccardo Mutti, please.": 1,
    " Yeah, it was very short, but you could see it's a completely different figure, right?": 1,
    "He's awesome.": 1,
    "He's so commanding.": 1,
    "So clear.": 1,
    " Maybe a little bit over clear.": 1,
    "Can we have a little demonstration?": 1,
    "Would you be my orchestra for a second?": 1,
    "Can you sing please the first note of Don Giovanni?": 1,
    "You have to sing.": 1,
    "And I'll stop you.": 1,
    " Come on, with me.": 1,
    "If you do it without me, I feel even more redundant than I already feel.": 1,
    "So, please, wait for the conductor.": 1,
    "Now, look at me and I stop you.": 1,
    "Let's go.": 1,
    " So we'll have a little chat later.": 1,
    "But...": 1,
    " There's a vacancy for a... But...": 1,
    " You could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger.": 1,
    "Now what does Riccardo Mutti do?": 1,
    "He does something like this.": 1,
    " And then sort of...": 1,
    " So not only the instruction is clear, but also the sanction.": 1,
    "What will happen if you don't do what I tell you?": 1,
    " So does it work?": 1,
    "Yes, it works.": 1,
    "To a certain point, when Muti is asked, why do you conduct like this, he says, I'm responsible.": 1,
    "Responsible in front of him.": 1,
    "Now he doesn't really mean him, he means Mozart, which is...": 1,
    " Like a third seat from the center.": 1,
    "So he said, if I'm responsible for Mozart, this is going to be the only story to be told.": 1,
    "It's Mozart as I, Ricardo Muti, understand it.": 1,
    " And you know what happened to Mutti?": 1,
    "Three years ago he got a letter signed by all 700 employees of La Scala, musical employees, I mean the musicians, saying, you're a great conductor, we don't want to work with you, please resign.": 1,
    " Why?": 1,
    "Because you don't let us develop.": 1,
    "You're using us as instruments, not as partners.": 1,
    "And our joy of music, etc.": 1,
    "So you had to resign, isn't that nice?": 1,
    " He's a nice guy, he's a really nice guy.": 1,
    "Can you do it with less control or with a different kind of control?": 1,
    "Let's look at the next conductor, Richard Strauss.": 1,
    " I'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked up on him because he's old.": 1,
    "It's not true.": 1,
    "When he was a young man, about 30, he wrote what he called the Ten Commandments for Conductors.": 1,
    " First one was, if you sweat by the end of the concert, it means that you must have done something wrong.": 1,
    "That's the first one.": 1,
    "The fourth one you like better.": 1,
    "It says, never look at the trombones.": 1,
    "It only encourages them.": 1,
    " So the whole idea is really to let it happen by itself, do not interfere.": 1,
    "But how does it happen?": 1,
    "Did you see him turning pages in the score?": 1,
    "Now, either he's senile,": 1,
    " and doesn't remember his own music because he wrote the music, or he's actually transferring a very strong message to them saying, come on guys, you have to play by the book.": 1,
    " So it's not about my story, it's not about your story, it's only the execution of the written music, no interpretation.": 1,
    "Interpretation is the real story of the performer.": 1,
    "So no, doesn't want that.": 1,
    " That's a different kind of control.": 1,
    "Let's see another superconductor, a German superconductor.": 1,
    "Herbert von Karajan, please.": 1,
    " What's different?": 1,
    "These are the eyes closed.": 1,
    "These are the hands.": 1,
    " Did you see this kind of movement?": 1,
    "Let me conduct you.": 1,
    "Twice.": 1,
    "Once like a Mutti and you'll clap.": 1,
    "Just once.": 1,
    "And then like Karajan.": 1,
    "Let's see what happens.": 1,
    "Like Mutti.": 1,
    "You ready?": 1,
    "Because Mutti... Okay?": 1,
    "Let's do it.": 1,
    " Hmm, anyway.": 1,
    " Now like a Kaya, since you're already trained, let me concentrate, close my eyes.": 1,
    "Come, come.": 1,
    " Why not together?": 1,
    "Because he didn't know when to play.": 1,
    "Now, I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonic don't know when to play.": 1,
    " But I'll tell you how they do it.": 1,
    "No cynicism.": 1,
    "This is a German orchestra.": 1,
    "They look at Karajan and then they look at each other.": 1,
    " Do you understand what this guy wants?": 1,
    " And after doing that, they really look at each other and the first players of the orchestra lead the whole ensemble in playing together.": 1,
    "And when Karen is asked about it, he actually says, yes, the worst damage I can do to my orchestra is to give them a clear": 1,
    " because that would prevent the ensemble, the listening to each other that's needed for an orchestra.": 1,
    "Now that's great.": 1,
    "What about the eyes?": 1,
    "Why are the eyes closed?": 1,
    " There's a wonderful story about Karan conducting in London, and he cues in a flute player like this.": 1,
    "The guy has no idea what to do.": 1,
    "Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?": 1,
    "What do you think Karan's reply was?": 1,
    " When should I start?": 1,
    "Oh yeah.": 1,
    "He says, you start when you can't stand it anymore.": 1,
    " Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything.": 1,
    "It's my music The real music is only in Karajan's head and you have to guess my mind So you are under tremendous pressure because I don't give you an instruction and yet you have to guess my mind": 1,
    " So it's a different kind of a very spiritual but yet very firm control.": 1,
    "Can we do it in another way?": 1,
    "Of course we can.": 1,
    "Let's go back to the first conductor we've seen, Carlos Kleiber, his name.": 1,
    "Next video please.": 1,
    " The End": 1,
    "Well, it is different, but isn't that controlling the same way?": 1,
    "No, it's not, because he's not telling them what to do.": 1,
    "When he does this, it's not, take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix.": 1,
    " Smash it on the floor.": 1,
    "It's not that.": 1,
    "He says this is the gesture of the music.": 1,
    "I'm opening a space for you to put in another layer of interpretation.": 1,
    "That is another story.": 1,
    " But how does it really work together if it doesn't give them instructions?": 1,
    "It's like being on a roller coaster.": 1,
    "You're not given any instructions.": 1,
    "But the forces of the process itself keep you in place.": 1,
    "That's what it does.": 1,
    " The interesting thing is, of course, that the roller coaster does not really exist.": 1,
    "It's not a physical thing.": 1,
    "It's in the players' heads.": 1,
    "And that's what makes them into partners.": 1,
    " You have the plan in your head.": 1,
    "You know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you, but rather here and there and that.": 1,
    "You know what to do and you become a partner, building the roller coaster.": 1,
    " with sound as you actually take the ride.": 1,
    "This is very exciting for those players.": 1,
    "They do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks later.": 1,
    " It is very tiring, but it's the best music making like this.": 1,
    "But of course, it's not only about motivation and giving them a lot of physical energy.": 1,
    "You also have to be very professional.": 1,
    " And look again at this climber.": 1,
    "Can we have the next video quickly to see what happens when there's a mistake?": 1,
    " Again, you see the beautiful body language.": 1,
    " And now there's a trumpet player who does something not exactly the way it should be done, go on with the video.": 1,
    "Look.": 1,
    "Second time for the same player.": 1,
    " And now the third time for the same player.": 1,
    " Wait for me after the concert, I have a short notice to give you.": 1,
    "You know, when it's needed, the authority is there.": 1,
    "It's very important.": 1,
    "But authority is not enough to make people your partners.": 1,
    "Let's see the next video, please.": 1,
    "See what happens here.": 1,
    " You might be surprised having seen Kleiber as such a hyperactive guy.": 1,
    "He's conducting Mozart.": 1,
    " The whole orchestra is playing.": 1,
    " Now something else.": 1,
    " Okay.": 1,
    " He is there 100% but not commanding, not telling what to do, rather enjoying what the cellist is doing.": 1,
    " Another solo now.": 1,
    "See what you can pick up from this.": 1,
    " Look at the eyes.": 1,
    " okay you see that first of all it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get it's not a feedback it's yeah it's come from here so that that's a good thing and the second thing": 1,
    " It's about actually being in control, but in a very special way.": 1,
    "When Kleiber does... Do you see the eyes going from here?": 1,
    "You know what happens?": 1,
    "Gravitation is no more.": 1,
    " Cliver not only creates a process, but also creates the conditions in the world in which this process takes place.": 1,
    "So again, the oboe player is completely autonomous.": 1,
    " and therefore happy and proud of his work and creative and all that.": 1,
    "And the level in which Kleiber is in control is a different level.": 1,
    "So control is no longer a zero sum game.": 1,
    "You have this control, you have this control and all we put together": 1,
    " in partnership brings about the best music.": 1,
    "So Clive is about process, Clive is about conditions in the world, but you need to have process and content.": 1,
    " to create a meaning.": 1,
    "Lenny Bernstein, my own personal maestro since he was my great teacher, Lenny Bernstein always started from the meaning.": 1,
    "Look at that please.": 1,
    " Do you remember the face of Mutti at the beginning?": 1,
    "Mutti had a wonderful expression, but only one.": 1,
    " Did you see Lenny's face?": 1,
    "You know why?": 1,
    "Because the meaning of the music is pain.": 1,
    "And you were playing a painful sound and you look at Lenny and he's...": 1,
    " He's suffering, but not in a way that he wants to stop.": 1,
    "He's suffering like, you know, enjoying himself in a Jewish way, as they say.": 1,
    " Yeah?": 1,
    "Not only seven, but you can see the music on his face.": 1,
    "You can see the baton left his hand, no more baton.": 1,
    "Now it's about you, the player, telling the story.": 1,
    " Now it's a reverse thing.": 1,
    "You're telling a story and you're telling a story.": 1,
    "And even briefly, you become the storyteller to which the community, the whole community listens to.": 1,
    "And Bernstein enables that.": 1,
    "Isn't that wonderful?": 1,
    " Now, if you are doing all the things we talked about together, and maybe some others, you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing.": 1,
    " And for the last video, I think this is simply the best title.": 1,
    "My friend Peter says, if you love something, give it away.": 1,
    "So, please.": 1
