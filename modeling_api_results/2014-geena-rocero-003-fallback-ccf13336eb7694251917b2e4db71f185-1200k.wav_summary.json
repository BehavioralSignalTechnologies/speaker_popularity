    "I said, mom, this is my hair.": 1,
    "I'm a girl.": 1,
    "I knew then how to self-identify.": 1,
    " Gender has always been considered a fact, immutable.": 1,
    "But we now know it's actually more fluid, complex, and mysterious.": 1,
    " Because of my success, I never had the courage to share my story.": 1,
    " not because I thought what I am is wrong, but because how the world treats those of us who wish to break free.": 1,
    " Every day I am so grateful because I am a woman.": 1,

    " That moment changed my life.": 1,
    " All of a sudden, I was introduced to the world of beauty pageant.": 1,
    "Not a lot of people could say that your first job is a pageant queen for transgender women, but I'll take it.": 1,
    " So from 15 to 17 years old, I joined the most prestigious pageant to the pageant where it's at the back of the truck, literally, or sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field, and when it rains,": 1,
    " which it rains a lot in the Philippines, the organizers will have to move it inside someone's house.": 1,
    " I also experienced the goodness of strangers, especially when we would travel in remote province in the Philippines.": 1,
    "But most importantly, I met some of my best friends in that community.": 1,

    " But then two weeks later, she called me, she said, did you know that if you moved to the United States, you could change your name and gender marker?": 1,
    "That was all I needed to hear.": 1,
    " My mom also told me to put two E's in the spelling of my name.": 1,
    "She also came with me when I had my surgery in Thailand at 19 years old.": 1,
    " It's interesting, in some of the most rural cities in Thailand, they perform some of the most prestigious, safe, and sophisticated surgery.": 1,
    " At that time in the United States, you needed to have a surgery before you could change your name and gender marker.": 1,
    " So in 2001, I moved to San Francisco.": 1,
    " And I remember looking at my California driver's license with the name Gina and gender marker F. That was a powerful moment.": 1,
    " I mean, for some people, their ID is their license to drive or even to get a drink.": 1,
    " But for me, that was my license to live, to feel dignified.": 1,
    " I mean, all of a sudden, my fears were minimized.": 1,

    " I mean, I'm here at this stage because it's a long history of people who fought and stood up for injustice.": 1,
    "This is Marsha P. Johnson and Silvia Rivera.": 1,
    " Today, this very moment is my real coming out.": 1,
    "I could no longer live my truth for and by myself.": 1,
    " I want to do my best to help others live their truth without shame and terror.": 1,
    " I am here.": 1,
    " Exposed.": 1,
    " so that one day there will never be a need for a November 28th vigil.": 1,
    " My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am.": 1,
    " Will you?": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1,
    " And I'm wondering what you would say, especially to parents, but in a more broad way to friends, to family, to anyone.": 1,
    " who finds themselves encountering a child or a person who is struggling with and uncomfortable with the gender that's being assigned them, what might you say to the family members of that person to help them become good and caring and kind family members to them?": 1,
    " Well, first, really, I'm so blessed.": 1,
    "I mean, the support system with my mom, especially, and my family, that in itself is just so powerful.": 1,
    "I mean, I remember every time I would coach young trans women, you know, would mentor them.": 1,
    " Sometimes when they would call me and tell me that their parents can't accept it, I would pick up that phone call and tell my mom, mom, can you call this woman?": 1,
    "Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.": 1,
    " gender identities in the core of our being, right?": 1,
    "I mean, we're all assigned gender at birth.": 1,
    "So what I'm trying to do is to have this conversation that sometimes that gender assignment doesn't match.": 1,
    " And there should be a space that would allow people to self-identify.": 1,
    "And that's a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.": 1,
    " The transgender movement, it's at the very beginning to compare to how the gay movement started.": 1,
    "There's still a lot of work that needs to be done.": 1,
    "There should be an understanding.": 1,
    "There should be a space of curiosity and asking questions.": 1,
