    "$82 a night.": 2,
    " Here's a question we need to rethink together.": 1,
    "What should be the role of money and markets in our societies?": 1,
    "Today there are very few things that money can't buy.": 1,
    " If you're sentenced to a jail term in Santa Barbara, California, you should know that if you don't like the standard accommodations, you can buy a prison cell upgrade.": 1,
    " It's true, for how much do you think?": 1,
    "What would you guess?": 1,
    " $500.": 1,
    "It's not the Ritz Carlton.": 1,
    "It's a jail.": 1,
    " If you go to an amusement park and don't want to stand in the long lines for the popular rides, there is now a solution.": 1,
    "In many theme parks, you can pay extra": 1,
    " to jump to the head of the line.": 1,
    "They call them fast track or VIP tickets.": 1,
    " And this isn't only happening in amusement parks.": 1,
    "In Washington, DC, long lines, queues sometimes form for important congressional hearings.": 1,
    " Now, some people don't like to wait in long queues, maybe overnight, even in the rain.": 1,
    "So now for lobbyists and others who are very keen to attend these hearings but don't like to wait, there are companies, line-standing companies,": 1,
    " You can go to them.": 1,
    "You can pay them a certain amount of money.": 1,
    "They hire homeless people and others who need a job to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes.": 1,
    " And the lobbyist, just before the hearing begins, can take his or her place at the head of the line and a seat in the front of the room.": 1,
    "Paid line standing.": 1,
    " It's happening, the recourse to market mechanisms and market thinking and market solutions in bigger arenas.": 1,
    " take the way we fight our wars.": 1,
    "Did you know that in Iraq and Afghanistan there were more private military contractors on the ground than there were US military troops?": 1,
    " Now this isn't because we had a public debate about whether we wanted to outsource war to private companies.": 1,
    " But this is what has happened.": 1,
    " Over the past three decades, we've lived through a quiet revolution.": 1,
    "We've drifted almost without realizing it from having a market economy.": 1,
    " to becoming market societies.": 1,
    "The difference is this, a market economy is a tool, a valuable and effective tool for organizing productive activity.": 1,
    " But a market society is a place where almost everything is up for sale.": 1,
    "It's a way of life in which market thinking and market values begin to dominate every aspect of life.": 1,
    " personal relations, family life, health, education, politics, law, civic life.": 1,
    "Now why worry?": 1,
    "Why worry about our becoming market societies?": 1,
    " For two reasons, I think.": 1,
    " One of them has to do with inequality.": 1,
    " The more things money can buy.": 1,
    " the more affluence or the lack of it matters.": 1,
    "If the only thing that money determined was access to yachts or fancy vacations or BMWs,": 1,
    " then inequality wouldn't matter very much.": 1,
    "But when money comes increasingly to govern access to the essentials of the good life,": 1,
    " decent healthcare, access to the best education, political voice and influence in campaigns.": 1,
    "When money comes to govern all of those things,": 1,
    " Inequality matters a great deal.": 1,
    "And so the marketization of everything sharpens the sting of inequality and its social and civic consequence.": 1,
    "That's one reason to worry.": 1,
    " There's a second reason, a part": 1,
    " from the worry about inequality.": 1,
    "And it's this.": 1,
    "With some social goods and practices, when market thinking and market values enter,": 1,
    " they may change the meaning of those practices and crowd out attitudes and norms worth caring about.": 1,
    "I'd like to take an example.": 1,
    " of a controversial use of a market mechanism, a cash incentive and see what you think about it.": 1,
    " Many schools struggle with the challenge of motivating kids, especially kids from disadvantaged backgrounds, to study hard, to do well in school, to apply themselves.": 1,
    " Some economists have proposed a market solution, offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades or high test scores or for reading books.": 1,
    " They've tried this, actually.": 1,
    "They've done some experiments in some major American cities, in New York, in Chicago, in Washington, D.C.": 1,
    " They've tried this, offering $50 for an A, $35 for a B. In Dallas, Texas, they have a program that offers eight-year-olds $2 for each book they read.": 1,
    " So let's see what, some people are in favor, some people are opposed to this cash incentive to motivate achievement.": 1,
    "Let's see what people here think about it.": 1,
    "Imagine that you are the head of a major school system.": 1,
    " And someone comes to you with this proposal.": 1,
    "And let's say it's a foundation.": 1,
    "They will provide the funds.": 1,
    "You don't have to take it out of your budget.": 1,
    "How many would be in favor and how many would be opposed?": 1,
    " to giving it a try.": 1,
    "Let's see by a show of hands.": 1,
    "First, how many think it might at least be worth a try?": 1,
    "See if it would work.": 1,
    "Raise your hand.": 1,
    " And how many would be opposed?": 1,
    "So the majority here are opposed, but a sizable minority are in favor.": 1,
    "Let's have a discussion.": 1,
    "Let's start with those of you who object.": 1,
    " who would rule it out even before trying?": 1,
    "What would be your reason?": 1,
    "Who will get our discussion started?": 1,
    "Yes.": 1,
    " Hello everyone, I'm Heike.": 1,
    "And I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation.": 1,
    "So it's in respect that children that they would like to read, you just take this incentive away in just paying them.": 1,
    "So it just changes behavior.": 1,
    " takes the intrinsic incentive away.": 1,
    "What is or should be the intrinsic motivation?": 1,
    "Well, the intrinsic motivation should be to learn.": 1,
    " to learn, to get to know the world.": 1,
    "And then if you stop paying them what happened then, then they stop reading.": 1,
    "Now, let's see if there's someone who favors, who thinks it's worth trying this": 1,
    " loftus and you said worth a try and so why not try it and do the experiment and measure things and measure and what would you measure you'd measure how many": 1,
    " how many books they read and how many books they continue to read after you stop paying them.": 1,
    "Oh, after you stop paying.": 1,
    "All right, what about that?": 1,
    " To be frank, I just think this is not to offend anyone, a very American way.": 1,
    " Alright, what's emerged from this discussion is the following question.": 1,
    "Will the cash incentive drive out or corrupt or crowd out the higher motivation, the intrinsic": 1,
    " Lesson that we hope to convey which is to learn to love to learn and to read for their own sakes and People disagree about what the effect will be": 1,
    " But that seems to be the question, that somehow a market mechanism or a cash incentive teaches the wrong lesson.": 1,
    " And if it does, what will become of these children later?": 1,
    "I should tell you what's happened with these experiments.": 1,
    "The cash for good grades": 1,
    " has had very mixed results, for the most part has not resulted in higher grades.": 1,
    "The two dollars for each book did lead those kids to read more books.": 1,
    "It also led them to read shorter books.": 1,
    " But the real question is, what will become of these kids later?": 1,
    "Will they have learned that reading is a chore, a form of peace work to be done for pay, that's the worry, or may it": 1,
    " lead them to read, maybe for the wrong reason initially, but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake.": 1,
    " Now, what this, even this brief debate brings out is something that many economists overlook.": 1,
    "Economists often assume that markets are inert.": 1,
    " that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange.": 1,
    "Market exchange, they assume.": 1,
    " doesn't change the meaning or value of the goods being exchanged.": 1,
    "This may be true enough if we're talking about material goods.": 1,
    "If you sell me a flat-screen television or give me one as a gift,": 1,
    " It will be the same good.": 1,
    "It will work the same either way.": 1,
    "But the same may not be true.": 1,
    " if we're talking about non-material goods in social practices such as teaching and learning or engaging together in civic life.": 1,
    "In those domains,": 1,
    " Bringing market mechanisms and cash incentives may undermine or crowd out non-market values and attitudes worth caring about.": 1,
    "Once we see": 1,
    " that markets and commerce, when extended beyond the material domain,": 1,
    " can change the character of the goods.": 1,
    " themselves can change the meaning of the social practices, as in the example of teaching and learning.": 1,
    " We have to ask where markets belong and where they don't, where they may actually undermine values and attitudes worth caring about.": 1,
    " But to have this debate, we have to do something we're not very good at, and that is to reason together in public about the value": 1,
    " in the meaning of the social practices we prize.": 1,
    " from our bodies, to family life, to personal relations, to health, to teaching and learning, to civic life.": 1,
    "Now these are controversial questions, and so we tend to shrink from them.": 1,
    " In fact, during the past three decades, when market reasoning and market thinking have gathered force and gained prestige, our public discourse during this time": 1,
    " has become hollowed out, empty of larger moral meaning.": 1,
    "For fear of disagreement, we shrink from these questions.": 1,
    "But once we see": 1,
    " that markets change the character of goods, we have to debate among ourselves": 1,
    " These bigger questions about how to value goods, one of the most corrosive effects of putting a price on everything.": 1,
    " is uncommonality, the sense that we are all in it together.": 1,
    " against the background of rising inequality, marketizing every aspect of life.": 1,
    " leads to a condition.": 1,
    " where those who are affluent": 1,
    " Those who are of modest means increasingly live separate lives.": 1,
    " We live and work and shop and play in different places.": 1,
    "Our children go to different schools.": 1,
    "This isn't good for democracy.": 1,
    " nor is it a satisfying way to live, even for those of us who can afford to buy our way to the head of the line.": 1,
    "Here's why.": 1,
    " Democracy does not require perfect equality.": 1,
    " But what it does require is that citizens share in a common life.": 1,
    "What matters is that people of different social backgrounds, different walks of life encounter one another.": 1,
    " bump up against one another in the ordinary course of life.": 1,
    "Because this is what teaches us to negotiate and to abide our differences.": 1,
    "And this is how we come to care for the common good.": 1,
    " And so in the end, the question of markets is not mainly an economic question.": 1,
    " It's really a question of how we want to live together.": 1,
    "Do we want a society where everything is up for sale?": 1,
    " or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy?": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
