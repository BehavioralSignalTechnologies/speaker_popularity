    " I am multidisciplinary.": 1,
    "As a scientist, I've been a crew commander for a NASA Mars simulation last year.": 1,
    "And as an artist, I create multicultural community art all over the planet.": 1,
    " And recently, I've actually been combining both.": 1,
    "But let me first talk a little more about that NASA mission.": 1,
    "This is the HI-SEAS program.": 1,
    "HI-SEAS is a NASA-funded planetary surface analog on the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii.": 1,
    " And it's a research program that is specifically designed to study the effects of long-term isolation of small crews.": 1,
    " I lived in this dome for four months with a crew of six.": 1,
    "Very interesting experience, of course.": 1,
    "We did all kinds of research.": 1,
    "Our main research was actually a food study, but apart from that food study,": 1,
    " developing a new food system for astronauts living in deep space.": 1,
    "We also did all kinds of other research.": 1,
    "We did extravehicular activities, as you can see here, wearing mock-up spacesuits,": 1,
    " But we also had our chores and lots of other stuff to do, like questionnaires at the end of every day.": 1,
    "Busy, busy work.": 1,
    " Now, as you can imagine, it's quite challenging to live with just a small group of people in a small space for a long time.": 1,
    "There's all kinds of psychological challenges.": 1,
    "How to keep a team together in these circumstances, right?": 1,
    " how to deal with the warping of time you start to sense when you're living in these circumstances, sleep problems that arise, etc.": 1,
    "But also learned a lot.": 1,
    " I learned a lot about how individual crew members actually cope with a situation like this.": 1,
    "How you can keep a crew productive and happy.": 1,
    " For example, giving them a good deal of autonomy is a good trick to do that.": 1,
    "And honestly, I learned a lot about leadership because I was the crew commander.": 1,
    " So, doing this mission, I really started thinking more deeply about our future in outer space.": 1,
    "We will venture into outer space and we will start inhabiting outer space.": 1,
    "I have no doubt about it.": 1,
    " It might take 50 years or it might take 500 years, but it's going to happen nevertheless.": 1,
    "So I came up with a new art project called Seeker.": 1,
    " And the Seeker project is actually challenging communities all over the world to come up with starship prototypes that re-envision human habitation and survival.": 1,
    "That's the core of the project.": 1,
    " Now, one important thing, this is not a dystopian project.": 1,
    "This is not about, oh my God, the world is going wrong and we have to escape because we need another future somewhere else.": 1,
    "No, no.": 1,
    " The project is basically inviting people to take a step away from earth-bound constraints and as such reimagine our future.": 1,
    "And it's really helpful and it works really well.": 1,
    "So that's really the important part of what we're doing.": 1,
    " Now, in this project, I'm using a co-creation approach, which is a slightly different approach from what you would expect from many artists.": 1,
    " I'm essentially dropping a basic idea into a group, into a community.": 1,
    "People start gravitating to the idea and together we shape and build the artwork.": 1,
    " It's a little bit like termites, really.": 1,
    "We just work together, and even, for example, when architects visit what we're doing, sometimes they have a bit of a hard time understanding how we build without a master plan.": 1,
    "But we always come up with these fantastic large-scale sculptures.": 1,
    " that actually we can also inhabit.": 1,
    "The first version was done in Belgium and Holland, was built with a team of almost 50 people.": 1,
    " This is the second iteration of that same project, but in Slovenia, in a different country.": 1,
    "And the new group was like, you know, we're going to do the architecture differently.": 1,
    " So they took away the architecture, they kept the base of the artwork, and they built an entirely new, much more biomorphic architecture on top of that.": 1,
    "And that's another crucial part of the project.": 1,
    "It's an evolving artwork, evolving architecture.": 1,
    " This was the last version that was just presented a few weeks ago in Holland, which was using caravans as modules to build a starship.": 1,
    "We bought some secondhand caravans, cut them open and reassembled them into a starship.": 1,
    " When we're thinking about Starships, we're not just approaching it as a technological challenge.": 1,
    "We're really looking at it as a combination of three systems.": 1,
    "Ecology, people and technology.": 1,
    "So there's always an ecological, strong ecological component in the project.": 1,
    "Here you can see": 1,
    " aquaponic systems that are actually surrounding the astronauts so they're constantly in contact with the food or part of the food that they're eating.": 1,
    " Now, a very typical thing for this project is that we run our own isolation missions inside these art and design projects.": 1,
    " We actually lock ourselves up for multiple days on end and test what we built.": 1,
    "And this, for example, on the right hand side you can see an isolation mission in the Museum of Modern Art in Ljubljana in Slovenia.": 1,
    " where six artists and designers locked themselves up, I was part of that, for four days inside the museum.": 1,
    "Of course, obviously, this is a very performative and very strong experience for all of us.": 1,
    " Now, the next version of the project is currently being developed together with Camilo Rodriguez Beltran, who is also a TED Fellow in the Atacama Desert in Chile.": 1,
    " a magical place.": 1,
    "First of all, it's really considered a Mars analog.": 1,
    "It really does look like Mars in certain locations and has been used by NASA to test equipment.": 1,
    " And it has a long history of being connected to space through observations of the stars.": 1,
    "It's now home to ALMA, this large telescope that's being developed there.": 1,
    " but also it's the driest location on the planet.": 1,
    "And that makes it extremely interesting to build our project, because suddenly sustainability is something we have to explore fully.": 1,
    " We have no other option, so I'm very curious to see what's going to happen.": 1,
    "Now, a specific thing for this particular version of the project is that I'm very interested to see how we can connect with local population.": 1,
    " Native population.": 1,
    "These people have been living there for a very long time and can be considered experts in sustainability.": 1,
    "And so I'm very interested to see what we can learn from them and have an input of indigenous knowledge into space exploration.": 1,
    " So we're trying to redefine how we look at our future in outer space by exploring integration of biology, technology and people by using a co-creation approach": 1,
    " and by using and exploring local traditions and to see how we can learn from the past, integrate that into our deep future.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
