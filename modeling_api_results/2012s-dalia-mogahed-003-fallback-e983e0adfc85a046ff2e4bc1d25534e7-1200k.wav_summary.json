    " My talk today is about something maybe a couple of you have already heard about.": 1,
    "It's called the Arab Spring.": 1,
    "Anyone heard of it?": 1,
    "Okay.": 1,
    " So in 2011, power shifted from the few to the many, from oval offices to central squares.": 1,
    " from carefully guarded airwaves to open source networks.": 1,
    " But before Tahrir was a global symbol of liberation, there were representative surveys already giving people a voice in quieter but still powerful ways.": 1,
    " I study Muslim societies around the world at Gallup.": 1,
    "Since 2001, we've interviewed hundreds of thousands of people, young and old, men and women, educated and illiterate.": 1,
    " My talk today draws on this research to reveal why Arabs rose up and what they want now.": 1,
    " Now, this region is very diverse and every country is unique, but those who revolted shared a common set of grievances.": 1,
    " and have similar demands today.": 1,
    "I'm going to focus a lot of my talk on Egypt.": 1,
    "It has nothing to do with the fact that I was born there, of course.": 1,
    " But it's the largest Arab country and it's also one with a great deal of influence.": 1,
    "But I'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region.": 1,
    " to look at the mundane topics of Arab views of religion and politics and how this impacts women, revealing some surprises along the way.": 1,
    " So after analyzing mounds of data, what we discovered was this.": 1,
    "Unemployment and poverty alone did not lead to the Arab revolts of 2011.": 1,
    " If an act of desperation by Tunisian fruit vendors sparked these revolutions, it was the difference between what Arabs experienced and what they expected that provided the fuel.": 1,
    " To tell you what I mean, consider this trend in Egypt.": 1,
    "On paper, the country was doing great.": 1,
    "In fact, it attracted accolades from multinational organizations because of its economic growth.": 1,
    " but under the surface was a very different reality.": 1,
    " In 2010, right before the revolution, even though GDP per capita had been growing at 5% for several years, Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives.": 1,
    " Now, this is very unusual because globally we find that, not surprisingly, people feel better as their country gets richer.": 1,
    " And that's because they have better job opportunities and their state offers better social services.": 1,
    "But it was exactly the opposite in Egypt.": 1,
    " As the country got more well off, unemployment actually rose and people's satisfaction with things like housing and education plummeted.": 1,
    " But it wasn't just anger at economic injustice.": 1,
    "It was also people's deep longing for freedom.": 1,
    " Contrary to the clash of civilization theory, Arabs didn't despise Western liberty.": 1,
    "They desired it.": 1,
    " As early as 2001, we asked Arabs and Muslims in general around the world what they admired most about the West.": 1,
    "Among the most frequent responses was liberty and justice.": 1,
    " In their own words, to an open-ended question, we heard their political system is transparent and it's following democracy in its true sense.": 1,
    "Another said it was liberty and freedom and being open-minded with each other.": 1,
    " majorities as high as 90% and greater in Egypt, Indonesia, and Iran told us in 2005": 1,
    " that if they were to write a new constitution for a theoretical new country, that they would guarantee freedom of speech as a fundamental right, especially in Egypt.": 1,
    " 88% said moving toward greater democracy would help Muslims progress, the highest percentage of any country we survey.": 1,
    " But pressed up against these democratic aspirations was a very different day-to-day experience, especially in Egypt.": 1,
    "While aspiring to democracy the most,": 1,
    " They were the least likely population in the world to say that they had actually voiced their opinion to a public official in the last month at only 4%.": 1,
    " So while economic development made a few people rich, it left many more worse off.": 1,
    " As people felt less and less free, they also felt less and less provided for.": 1,
    " So rather than viewing their former regimes as generous if overprotective fathers, they viewed them as essentially prison wardens.": 1,
    " So now that Egyptians have ended Mubarak's 30 year rule, they potentially could be an example for the region.": 1,
    "If Egypt is to succeed at building a society based on the rule of law,": 1,
    " It could be a model.": 1,
    " If, however, the core issues that propelled the revolution aren't addressed, the consequences could be catastrophic, not just for Egypt, but for the entire region.": 1,
    " The signs don't look good, some have said.": 1,
    " Islamists, not the young liberals that sparked the revolution, won the majority in parliament.": 1,
    " The military council has cracked down on civil society and protests, and the country's economy continues to suffer.": 1,
    " Evaluating Egypt on this basis alone however ignores the real revolution.": 1,
    " Because Egyptians are more optimistic than they have been in years, far less divided on religious secular lines than we would think, and poised for the demands of democracy.": 1,
    " Whether they support Islamists or liberals, Egyptians' priorities for this government are identical and they are jobs, stability and education, not moral policing.": 1,
    " But most of all, for the first time in decades they expect to be active participants, not spectators, in the affairs of their country.": 1,
    " I was meeting with a group of newly elected parliamentarians from Egypt and Tunisia a couple of weeks ago.": 1,
    "What really struck me about them": 1,
    " was that they weren't.": 1,
    " only optimistic, but they kind of struck me as nervous, for lack of a better word.": 1,
    "One said to me, our people used to gather in cafes to watch football, or soccer, as we say in America.": 1,
    " And now they gather to watch Parliament.": 1,
    " They're really watching us and we can't help.": 1,
    " but worry that we're not gonna live up to their expectations.": 1,
    "And what really struck me is that less than 24 months ago, it was the people that were nervous about being watched by their government.": 1,
    " And the reason that they're expecting a lot is because they have a newfound hope for the future.": 1,
    "So right before the revolution,": 1,
    " We said that Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives, but not only that, they thought their future would be no better.": 1,
    "What really changed after the ouster of Mubarak wasn't that life got easier, it actually got harder.": 1,
    " But people's expectations for their future went up significantly, and this hope, this optimism, endured a year of turbulent transition.": 1,
    " One reason that there's this optimism is because": 1,
    " contrary to what many people have said, most Egyptians think things really have changed in many ways.": 1,
    "So while Egyptians were known for their single-digit": 1,
    " turnout in elections before the revolution.": 1,
    "The last election had around 70% voter turnout, men and women.": 1,
    " where scarcely a quarter believed in the honesty of elections in 2010, I'm surprised it was a quarter, 90% thought that this last election was honest.": 1,
    " Now, why this matters is because we discovered a link between people's faith in their democratic process": 1,
    " and their faith that oppressed people can change their situation through peaceful means alone.": 1,
    " Now I know what some of you are thinking.": 1,
    " The Egyptian people and many other Arabs who have revolted and are in transition have very high expectations of the government.": 1,
    " victims of a long-time autocracy, expecting a paternal state to solve all their problems.": 1,
    " But this conclusion would ignore a tectonic shift taking place in Egypt far from the cameras in Tahrir Square.": 1,
    " And that is Egyptians' elevated expectations are placed first on themselves.": 1,
    " In the country once known for its passive resignation, where as bad as things got, only 4% expressed their opinion to a public official,": 1,
    " Today, 90% tell us that if there's a problem in their community, it's up to them to fix it.": 1,
    " And three-fourths believe they not only have the responsibility, but the power to make change.": 1,
    " And this empowerment also applies to women whose role in the revolts cannot be underestimated.": 1,
    " They were doctors and dissidents, artists and organizers, a full third of those who braved tanks and tear gas.": 1,
    " to ask or to demand liberty and justice in Egypt for women.": 1,
    " Now people have raised some real concerns about what the rise of Islamist parties means for women.": 1,
    " What we found about the role of religion and law and the role of religion in society is that there's no female consensus.": 1,
    " We found that women in one country look more like the men in that country than their female counterparts across the border.": 1,
    " Now what this suggests is that how women view religion's role in society is shaped more by their own country's culture and context": 1,
    " than one monolithic view that religion is simply bad for women.": 1,
    " Where women agree, however, is on their own role, and that it must be central and active.": 1,
    "And here is where we see the greatest gender difference within a country on the issue of women's rights.": 1,
    " Now how men feel about women's rights matters to the future of this region.": 1,
    "Because we discovered a link between men's support for women's employment": 1,
    " and how many women are actually employed in professional fields in that country.": 1,
    "So the question becomes, what drives men's support for women's rights?": 1,
    " What about men's views of religion and law?": 1,
    " Is a man's opinion of the role of religion in politics shape their view of women's rights?": 1,
    " The answer is no.": 1,
    "We found absolutely no correlation, no impact whatsoever between these two variables.": 1,
    "What drives men's support for women's employment is men's employment.": 1,
    " their level of education, as well as a high score on their country's UN Human Development Index.": 1,
    " What this means is that human development, not secularization, is what's key to women's empowerment in the transforming Middle East.": 1,
    " And the transformation continues.": 1,
    "From Wall Street to Mohammed Mahmoud Street, it has never been more important to understand the aspirations of ordinary people.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
