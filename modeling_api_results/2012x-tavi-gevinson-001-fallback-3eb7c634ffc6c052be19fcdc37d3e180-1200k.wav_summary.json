    " Ten years ago, today exactly, actually, I started a fashion blog called Style Rookie.": 1,
    "Last September of 2011, I started an online magazine for teenage girls called rookiemag.com.": 1,
    " My name is Tavi Gevinson and": 1,
    " The title of my talk is Still Figuring It Out, and the MS Paint quality of my slides was a total creative decision in keeping with today's theme and has nothing to do with my inability to use PowerPoint.": 1,
    " So I edit the site for teenage girls.": 1,
    "I'm a feminist.": 1,
    "I am kind of a pop culture nerd, and I think a lot about what makes a strong female character.": 1,
    "Movies and TV shows, these things have influenced my own website.": 1,
    " So, I think the question of what makes a strong female character often goes misinterpreted, and instead we get these two-dimensional super women who maybe have one quality that's played up a lot.": 1,
    " like, you know, a catwoman type, or, um, she, like, plays her sexuality up a lot and it's seen as power, but they're not...": 1,
    " strong characters who happen to be female, they're completely flat and they're basically cardboard characters.": 1,
    "The problem with this is that then people expect women to be that easy to": 1,
    " understand and women are mad at themselves for not being that simple.": 1,
    "When in actuality, women are complicated, women are multifaceted, not because women are crazy, but because people are crazy and women happen to be people.": 1,
    " So the flaws are the key.": 1,
    "I'm not the first person to say this.": 1,
    "What makes a strong female character is a character who has weaknesses, who has flaws, who is maybe not immediately likable, but eventually relatable.": 1,
    " I don't like to acknowledge a problem without also acknowledging those who work to fix it, so just wanted to acknowledge shows like Mad Men, movies like Bridesmaids, whose female characters are protagonists.": 1,
    " are complex, multi-faceted.": 1,
    "Lena Dunham, who's on here, her show on HBO that premieres next month, Girls,": 1,
    " She said she wanted to start it because she felt that every woman she knew was just a bundle of contradictions.": 1,
    "And that feels accurate for all people, but you don't see women represented like that as much.": 1,
    "Congrats, guys.": 1,
    " But I don't feel that.": 1,
    " I still feel that there are some types of women who are not represented that way and one group that will focus on today are teens because I think teenagers are especially contradictory and still figuring it out.": 1,
    " And in the 90s, there was Freaks and Geeks and My So-Called Life and their characters, Lindsay Weir and Angela Chase.": 1,
    "I mean, the whole premise of the show, the shows were just them trying to figure themselves out, basically.": 1,
    " But those shows only lasted a season each and I haven't really seen anything like that on TV since.": 1,
    " So this is a scientific diagram.": 1,
    " of my brain around the time when I started watching those TV shows.": 1,
    "I was like ending middle school, starting high school.": 1,
    "I'm a sophomore now.": 1,
    " And I was trying to reconcile all of these differences that you're told you can't be when you're growing up as a girl.": 1,
    "You can't be smart and pretty.": 1,
    "You can't be a feminist who's also interested in fashion.": 1,
    " care about clothes if it's not for the sake of what other people, usually men, will think of you.": 1,
    "So I was trying to figure all that out.": 1,
    " And I felt a little confused and I said so on my blog and I said that I wanted to start a website for teenage girls that was not this kind of": 1,
    " one-dimensional strong character empowerment thing.": 1,
    " Because I think one thing that can be very alienating about a misconception of feminism is that girls then think that to be a feminist they have to live up to being perfectly consistent in your beliefs, never being insecure, never having doubts.": 1,
    " having all of the answers.": 1,
    "And this is not true and actually reconciling all the contradictions I was feeling became easier once I understood that feminism was not a rule book.": 1,
    " but a discussion, a conversation, a process.": 1,
    "And this is a spread from a zine that I made last year when I, I mean I think I've let myself go a bit on the illustration front since, but.": 1,
    " Yeah.": 1,
    " So I said on my blog that I wanted to start this publication for teenage girls and ask people to submit their writing, their photography, whatever, to be a member of our staff.": 1,
    "I got about 3,000 emails.": 1,
    " My editorial director and I went through them and put together a staff of people and we launched last September.": 1,
    " And this is an excerpt from my first editor's letter where I say that, Rookie, we don't have all the answers.": 1,
    "We're still figuring it out, too.": 1,
    "But the point is not to give girls the answers and not even give them permission.": 1,
    " to find the answers themselves, but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission.": 1,
    "They can ask their own questions, find their own answers, all of that.": 1,
    "And Rookie, I think we've been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out.": 1,
    " So I'm not saying like be like us and we're perfect role models because we're not but we just want to": 1,
    " help represent girls in a way that shows those different dimensions.": 1,
    "I mean we have articles called": 1,
    " on taking yourself seriously, how to not care what people think of you.": 1,
    "But we also have articles like, oops, I'm figuring it out.": 1,
    "If you use that, you can get away with anything.": 1,
    " We also have articles called how to look like you weren't just crying in less than five minutes.": 1,
    "So all of that being said, I still really appreciate those characters in movies and": 1,
    " articles like that on our site that are just about being totally powerful, maybe finding your acceptance with yourself and self-esteem and your flaws.": 1,
    " how you accept those.": 1,
    "So what I want you to take away from my talk, the lesson of all of this, is to just be Stevie Nicks.": 1,
    "Like, that's all you have to do.": 1,
    " Because my favorite thing about her other than like everything is that": 1,
    " She has always been unapologetically present on stage and unapologetic about her flaws and about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings.": 1,
    " and she makes you listen to them and think about them.": 1,
    "And yeah, so please be Stevie Nicks.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
