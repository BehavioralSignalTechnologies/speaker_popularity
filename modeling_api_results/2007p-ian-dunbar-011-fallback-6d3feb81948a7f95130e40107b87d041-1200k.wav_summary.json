    "Sit.": 4,
    "Johnny, don't do that.": 2,
    "Kick, kick, kick.": 2,
    " Dogs have interests.": 1,
    "They have interests sniffing each other, chasing squirrels, and if we don't make that a reward in training, that will be a distraction.": 1,
    " It's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought that if you see a dog in a park and the owner's calling it and the owner says, puppy, come here, come here.": 1,
    " And the dog thinks, hmm, interesting.": 1,
    "I'm sniffing this out the dog's rear end.": 1,
    " The owner's calling.": 1,
    "It's a difficult choice, right?": 1,
    "Rear end, owner.": 1,
    "Rear end wins.": 1,
    "I mean, you lose.": 1,
    "You cannot compete with the environment if you have an adolescent dog's brain.": 1,
    " So when we train, we're always trying to take into account the dog's point of view.": 1,
    "Now I'm here largely because there's a, it's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment that on one side we have people who think that": 1,
    " You train a dog, number one, by making up rules.": 1,
    "Human rules, we don't take the dog's point of view into account, so the human says, you're going to act this way, damn it, we're going to...": 1,
    " force you to act against your will, to bend to our will.": 1,
    "Then number two, we keep these rules a secret from the dog.": 1,
    "And then number three, now we can punish the dog for breaking rules he didn't even know existed.": 1,
    "So you get a little puppy, he comes,": 1,
    " His only crime is he grew.": 1,
    "When he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg, you know, just like a little clear, isn't that nice, you know, and you go, oh, there's a good boy.": 1,
    "You bend down, you pat him, you reward him for jumping up.": 1,
    " His one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff and a few months later he weighs, you know, 80 pounds.": 1,
    "Every time he jumps up, he gets all sorts of abuse.": 1,
    "I mean, it is really very, very scary.": 1,
    " the abuse that dogs get.": 1,
    "So there's a whole dominance issue.": 1,
    "Number one, what we get in dog training is this Mickey Mouse interpretation of a very complicated social system and they take this stuff seriously.": 1,
    " Male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy because it prevents physical fights.": 1,
    "Of course, female dogs, bitches on the other hand, have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule.": 1,
    "The number one is, I have it, you don't.": 1,
    " And what you will find is a very, very low ranking bit will quite easily keep a bone away from a high ranking male.": 1,
    " So we get in dog training this notion of dominances or of the alpha dog.": 1,
    "I'm sure you've heard this.": 1,
    "Dogs get so abused.": 1,
    " dogs, horses, and humans.": 1,
    "These are the three species which are so abused in life.": 1,
    "And the reason it's built into their behavior is to always come back and apologize.": 1,
    "Like, oh, I'm sorry you had to beat me.": 1,
    "I'm really sorry.": 1,
    "Yes, it's my fault.": 1,
    "They are just so beatable.": 1,
    " And that's why they get beaten.": 1,
    "The poor puppy jumps up.": 1,
    "You open the dog book.": 1,
    "What does it say?": 1,
    "Hold his front paws.": 1,
    "Squeeze his front paws.": 1,
    "Stamp on his hind feet.": 1,
    " squirt him in the face with lemon juice, hit him on the head with a rolled up newspaper, knee him in the chest, flip him over backwards.": 1,
    "Because he grew...": 1,
    " And because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do, this is insanity.": 1,
    "Why don't you just, I ask Ernest, well, how would you like the dog to greet you?": 1,
    "And people say, well, I don't know, to sit, I guess.": 1,
    "I say, let's teach him to sit.": 1,
    " and then we give him a reason for sitting.": 1,
    " Because the stages are training first.": 1,
    "The first stage is basically teaching a dog ESL.": 1,
    "I could speak to you and say,": 1,
    " Come on, something should happen now.": 1,
    "Why aren't you responding?": 1,
    "Oh, you don't speak Swahili.": 1,
    "Well, I've got news for you.": 1,
    "The dog doesn't speak English.": 1,
    "So the first day, or American, or Spanish, or French.": 1,
    " So the first stage in training is to teach the dog ESL, English as a second language.": 1,
    "And that's how we use the food in the hand.": 1,
    "And we use food because we're dealing with owners.": 1,
    " My wife doesn't need food, she's a great trainer, much better than I am.": 1,
    "I don't need food, but the average owner says, puppy, sit.": 1,
    " Or they go, sit, sit, sit.": 1,
    "They're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason.": 1,
    "Like the dog has a third eye there.": 1,
    "It's insane.": 1,
    " You know, sit, sit.": 1,
    "No, we go, puppy, sit.": 1,
    "Boom, it's got it in six to 10 trials.": 1,
    "Then we phase out the food as a lure.": 1,
    "And now the dog knows that sit means sit.": 1,
    "And you can actually communicate to a dog in a perfectly constructed English sentence.": 1,
    " Phoenix, come here, take this and go to Jamie, please.": 1,
    "And I've taught of Phoenix, come here, take this, go to, and the name of my son, Jamie.": 1,
    " and the doc can take a note, and I've got my own little search and rescue doc.": 1,
    "You'll find Jamie wherever he is, wherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something, and take me a little message that says, hey, dinner's ready.": 1,
    "Come in for dinner.": 1,
    " At this point, the dog knows what we want it to do.": 1,
    "Will it do it?": 1,
    "Not necessarily.": 1,
    "No.": 1,
    "As I said, if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff, why come to the owner?": 1,
    "The dog lives with you.": 1,
    " The dog can get you anytime.": 1,
    "The dog can sniff your butt if you like when he wants to.": 1,
    "At the moment he's in the park and you are competing with smells and other dogs and squirrels.": 1,
    "So the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want.": 1,
    " to do what we want him to do.": 1,
    "And this is very easy.": 1,
    "We use the pre-MAC principle.": 1,
    "Basically, we follow a low frequency behavior, one the dog doesn't want to do, by a high frequency behavior, commonly known as a behavior problem or a dog hobby.": 1,
    " something the dog does like to do.": 1,
    "That will then become a reward for the lower frequency behavior.": 1,
    "So we go sit.": 1,
    " On the couch.": 1,
    "Tummy rub.": 1,
    "Look, I throw a tennis ball.": 1,
    "Say hello to that other dog.": 1,
    "Yes, we put sniff-butt on cue.": 1,
    " Sit, sniff, butt.": 1,
    "So now all of these distractions that worked against training now become rewards that work for training.": 1,
    "And what we're doing in essence is we're teaching the dog kind of like": 1,
    " When we let the dog think that the dog is training us, and I can imagine this dog, you know, speaking through the friends to say an Akita, saying, wow, my owner, they are so incredibly easy to train.": 1,
    "They're like golden retrievers.": 1,
    " All I have to do is sit.": 1,
    "They do everything.": 1,
    "They open doors.": 1,
    "They drive my car.": 1,
    "They massage me.": 1,
    "They will throw tennis balls.": 1,
    "They will cook for me and serve the food.": 1,
    "It's like if I just sit, that's my command, then I have my own personal doorman.": 1,
    " chauffeur, masseuse, chef, and waiter.": 1,
    "And now the dog's really happy.": 1,
    "And this to me is always what training is.": 1,
    "So we really motivate the dog to want to do it.": 1,
    " such that the need for punishment seldom comes up.": 1,
    " Now we move to phase three.": 1,
    "There's times you know when daddy knows best.": 1,
    " And I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says, because I'm the daddy.": 1,
    "That's why.": 1,
    "Sorry.": 1,
    "No more explanation.": 1,
    "I'm the daddy.": 1,
    "You're not.": 1,
    "And there's times, for example, if my son's friends leave the door open,": 1,
    " The dogs have to know you don't step across this line.": 1,
    "This is a life or death thing.": 1,
    "You leave the sanctity of your house and you could be hit on the street.": 1,
    "So some things we have to let the dog know you mustn't do this.": 1,
    " And so we have to enforce, but without force.": 1,
    "People here get very confused about what a punishment is.": 1,
    "They think a punishment is something nasty.": 1,
    " I bet a lot of you do, right?": 1,
    "You think it's something painful or scary or nasty.": 1,
    "It doesn't have to be.": 1,
    "There's several definitions of what a punishment is, but one definition, the most popular, is a punishment is a stimulus that": 1,
    " reduces the immediately preceding behavior such that it's less likely to occur in the future.": 1,
    " It does not have to be nasty, scary, or painful.": 1,
    "And I would say if it doesn't have to be, then maybe it shouldn't be.": 1,
    " I was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago, and this is a dog that put both his owners in hospital, plus a brother-in-law, plus a child.": 1,
    "And I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house.": 1,
    "They never took it outside.": 1,
    "The dog is actually euthanized now.": 1,
    " This is a dog I worked with for a while.": 1,
    "A lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen.": 1,
    "So while I was there, this was on the fourth visit, we did a four and a half hour down stay with the dog on his mat.": 1,
    "And he was kept there by the owners.": 1,
    " calm insistence.": 1,
    "When the dog would try to leave the mat, she would say, Rover, on the mat, on the mat, on the mat.": 1,
    "The dog broke his down stay 22 times in four and a half hours.": 1,
    "She cooked dinner.": 1,
    " That's why we had a lot of aggression related towards food.": 1,
    "The breaks got fewer and fewer.": 1,
    "You see, the punishment was working.": 1,
    " that the behavior problem was going away.": 1,
    "She never raised her voice.": 1,
    "If she did, she would have got bitten.": 1,
    "It's not a good dog you shout at.": 1,
    " A lot of my friends train really neat animals, grizzly bears.": 1,
    "If you've ever seen a grizzly bear on a Tellurian film, then it's a friend of mine who's trained it.": 1,
    "Whales.": 1,
    "I love it because it wise you up.": 1,
    "How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear?": 1,
    " Bad bear!": 1,
    "Bad bear!": 1,
    "Your head now is a hundred yards away, sailing through the air.": 1,
    "Okay, this is crazy.": 1,
    "So, where do we go from here?": 1,
    "We want a better way.": 1,
    "Dogs deserve better.": 1,
    " But for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs.": 1,
    "It has to do with watching people train puppies and realizing they have horrendous...": 1,
    " interaction skills, horrendous relationship skills, not just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class.": 1,
    "My all-time classic is another come here one.": 1,
    "You see someone in the park, and I'll cover my mic when I say this because I don't want to wake you up.": 1,
    " And there's the owner in the park and their dog's over here and they say, Rover, come here.": 1,
    "Rover, come here.": 1,
    "Rover, come here, you son of a bitch!": 1,
    "The dog says, they don't think so.": 1,
    "I mean, who in their right mind?": 1,
    " would think that a dog would want to approach them when they're screaming like that.": 1,
    "Instead the dog says, I know that tone.": 1,
    "I know that tone.": 1,
    "Previously, when I've approached, I've got punished there.": 1,
    " I was walking onto a plane.": 1,
    "This for me was a pivotal moment in my career and it really cemented what I wanted to do with this whole puppy training thing.": 1,
    "The notion of how to teach puppies in a dog friendly way to want to do what we want to do so we don't have to force them.": 1,
    " You know, I puppy trained my child.": 1,
    " And the seminal moment was, I was getting on a plane in Dallas, and in row two was a father, I presume, and a young boy, about five, kicking the back of the chair.": 1,
    "I'm standing right here with my bag.": 1,
    " The father leans over, grabs him, like this, and gives him ugly face.": 1,
    "An ugly face is this.": 1,
    "When you go face to face with a puppy or a child, you say, but you gotta stop it!": 1,
    "Stop it!": 1,
    " I went, Oh my God, do I do something?": 1,
    "This, that child has lost everything that one of the two people he can trust in this world has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet.": 1,
    "And I thought, do I tell this jerk,": 1,
    " I thought, Ian, stay out of it, stay out of it.": 1,
    "You know, walk on.": 1,
    "I walked to the back of the plane.": 1,
    "I sat down and a thought came to me.": 1,
    "If that had been a dog, I would have laid him out.": 1,
    " If he had kicked a dog, I would have punched him out.": 1,
    " kicked a child, grabs a child like this, and I let it go.": 1,
    "And this is what it's all about.": 1,
    "These relations skills are so easy.": 1,
    "I mean, we as humans are": 1,
    " as shallowness when we choose a life mate, you know, based on the 3C, coat color, confirmation, cuteness, you know, kind of like a little robot.": 1,
    "This is how we go into a relationship and it's hunky-dory for a year and then a little behavior problem comes up.": 1,
    " No different from the dog barking.": 1,
    "The husband won't clear up his clothes.": 1,
    "Or the wife's always late for meetings, whatever it is.": 1,
    "Okay?": 1,
    "And it then starts.": 1,
    "And we get into this thing and our personal feedback, there's two things about it when you watch people": 1,
    " interacting with animals or other people, there is very little feedback.": 1,
    "It's too infrequent.": 1,
    "And when it happens, it's bad.": 1,
    "It's nasty.": 1,
    "You see this especially in families.": 1,
    " especially with spouses, especially with children, especially with parents, especially in the workplace, especially from boss to employee.": 1,
    "It's as if there's some schadenfreude there that": 1,
    " that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them.": 1,
    "And this I would say is the biggest human foible that we have.": 1,
    "It really is.": 1,
    "We take the good for granted": 1,
    " and we moan and groan at the bad.": 1,
    "And I think this whole notion of these skills should be taught.": 1,
    "You know, calculus is wonderful.": 1,
    "When I was a kid, I was a calculus whiz.": 1,
    "I don't understand a thing about it now, but I could do it as a kid.": 1,
    " geometry fantastic you know quantum mechanics these are cool things but they don't save marriages and they don't raise children and my look to the future is and what I want to do with this doggy stuff is to teach people that": 1,
    " You know, your husband's just as easy to train.": 1,
    "Probably easier if you've got a roti.": 1,
    "Much easier to train.": 1,
    "Your kids are easy to train.": 1,
    "All you've got to do is to watch them, to time sample the behaviour and say every five minutes you ask the question,": 1,
    " Is it good or is it bad?": 1,
    "If it's good, say, that was really neat.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    "That is such a powerful training technique.": 1,
    "This should be taught in schools, relationships.": 1,
    "How do you negotiate?": 1,
    "How do you negotiate with your friend who wants your toy?": 1,
    " You know, how do you prepare you for your first relationship?": 1,
    "How on earth about raising children, we think how we do it, one night in bed we're pregnant and then we're raising the most important thing in life, a child.": 1,
    "This is what should be taught, the good living, the good habits.": 1,
    " which are just as hard to break as bad habits.": 1,
    "So that would be my wish to the future.": 1,
    "Damn, I wanted to end exactly on time, but I got eight, seven, six, five, four, three,": 1,
    " So thank you very much.": 1,
    "That's my talk.": 1,
    "Thank you": 1
