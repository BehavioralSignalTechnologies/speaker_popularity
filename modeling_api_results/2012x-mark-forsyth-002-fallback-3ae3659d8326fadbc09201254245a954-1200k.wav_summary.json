    " One of my favourite words in the whole of the Oxford English Dictionary is snollygoster, just because it sounds so good.": 1,
    "And what snollygoster means is a dishonest politician.": 1,
    " Although there was a 19th century newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said,": 1,
    " and who, when he wins, gets there by the sheer force of monumental, torchnophical assumption.": 1,
    " Now, I have no idea what talknophical is.": 1,
    "It's something to do with words, I assume.": 1,
    "But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know they have to try and control language.": 1,
    " It wasn't until, for example, 1771 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report the exact words that were said in the debating chamber.": 1,
    " And this was actually all down to the bravery of a guy with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who took on Parliament, and he was thrown into the Tower of London and imprisoned, but he was brave enough.": 1,
    " He was brave enough to take them on, and in the end he had such popular support in London that he won.": 1,
    "And it was only a few years later that we have the first recorded use of the phrase, as bold as brass.": 1,
    " Most people think that's down to the metal.": 1,
    "It's not.": 1,
    "It's down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press.": 1,
    " But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want to take you back to the United States of America just after they'd achieved independence.": 1,
    " And they had to face the question of what to call George Washington, their leader.": 1,
    "They didn't know.": 1,
    "What do you call the leader of a Republican country?": 1,
    " And this was debated in Congress for ages and ages.": 1,
    "And there were all sorts of suggestions on the table which might have made it.": 1,
    "I mean, some people wanted him to be called Chief Magistrate Washington and other people, His Highness George Washington and other people.": 1,
    " protector of the liberties of the people of the United States of America.": 1,
    " Washington.": 1,
    "Not that catchy.": 1,
    "Some people just wanted to call him king.": 1,
    "They thought it was tried and tested.": 1,
    "And they weren't even being monarchical there.": 1,
    "They had the idea that you could be elected king for a fixed term.": 1,
    "And, you know, could have worked.": 1,
    " And everybody got insanely bored, actually, because this debate went on for three weeks, and I read a diary of this poor senator who just keeps coming back and is still on this subject.": 1,
    " And the reason for the delay in the boredom was that the House of Representatives were against the Senate.": 1,
    "The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to get drunk on power.": 1,
    "They didn't want to call him king in case that gave him ideas or his successor ideas.": 1,
    " So they wanted to give him the humblest, meagerest, most pathetic title they could think of.": 1,
    "And that title...": 1,
    " was president.": 1,
    " President.": 1,
    "They didn't invent the title.": 1,
    "I mean, it existed before, but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting.": 1,
    "It was like the foreman of the jury, and it didn't have much more grandeur than the term foreman or overseer.": 1,
    "There were occasional": 1,
    " presidents of little colonial councils and bits of government, but it was really a nothing title.": 1,
    "And that's why the Senate objected to it.": 1,
    "They said, that's ridiculous.": 1,
    "You can't call him president.": 1,
    " this guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries.": 1,
    "And who's going to take him seriously if he's got a silly little title like President of the United States of America?": 1,
    "And after three weeks of debate, in the end,": 1,
    " The Senate did not cave in.": 1,
    " Instead, they agreed to use the title president for now.": 1,
    "But they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn't agree with it.": 1,
    " from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations, whether under republican or monarchical forms of government, whose custom it is to annex": 1,
    " to the office of the chief magistrate, titles of respectability.": 1,
    "Not bloody president.": 1,
    " and that in the intercourse with foreign nations.": 1,
    " The majesty of the people of the United States may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity, i.e.": 1,
    "we don't want to look like bloody widows.": 1,
    " Now you can learn three interesting things from this.": 1,
    "First of all, and this is my favorite, is that so far as I've ever been able to find out, the Senate has never formally endorsed the title of president.": 1,
    " Barack Obama, President Obama is there on borrowed time just waiting for the Senate to spring into action.": 1,
    " Second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure,": 1,
    " You can still be waiting 223 years later.": 1,
    " The title, President of the United States of America, doesn't sound that humble at all these days, does it?": 1,
    " Something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear warheads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff.": 1,
    " reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur.": 1,
    " And so the Senate won in the end.": 1,
    "They got their title of respectability.": 1,
    "And also the Senate's other worry, the appearance of singularity.": 1,
    "Well, it was a singularity back then.": 1,
    "But now, do you know how many nations have a president? 147.": 1,
    " or because they want to sound like the guy who's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc.": 1,
    " And so in the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives lost.": 1,
    " because nobody's going to feel that humble when they're told that they are now the president of the United States of America.": 1,
    " And that's the important lesson I think you can take away and the one I want to leave you with.": 1,
    "Politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality.": 1,
    "But in fact...": 1,
    " Reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
