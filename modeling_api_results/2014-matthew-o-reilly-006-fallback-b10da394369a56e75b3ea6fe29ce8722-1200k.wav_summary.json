    " I've been a critical care EMT for the past seven years in Suffolk County, New York.": 1,
    "I've been a first responder in a number of incidents ranging from car accidents to Hurricane Sandy.": 1,
    " If you were like most people, death might be one of your greatest fears.": 1,
    "Some of us will see it coming.": 1,
    "Some of us won't.": 1,
    "There's a little-known documented medical term called impending doom.": 1,
    " It's almost a symptom.": 1,
    "As a medical provider, I'm trained to respond to the symptom like any other.": 1,
    "So when a patient having a heart attack looks at me and says, I'm going to die today, we are trained to reevaluate the patient's condition.": 1,
    " Throughout my career, I've responded to a number of incidents where a patient had minutes left to live and there was nothing I could do for them.": 1,
    " With this I was faced with a dilemma.": 1,
    " Do I tell the dying that they are about to face death?": 1,
    "Or do I lie to them to comfort them?": 1,
    " Early in my career, I faced this dilemma by simply lying.": 1,
    "I was afraid.": 1,
    "I was afraid if I told them the truth that they would die in terror, in fear, just grasping for those last moments of life.": 1,
    " That all changed with one incident.": 1,
    "Five years ago, I responded to a motorcycle accident.": 1,
    "The rider had suffered critical, critical injuries.": 1,
    "As I assessed him, I realized there was nothing that could be done for him.": 1,
    " And like so many other cases, he looked me in the eye and asked that question, am I going to die?": 1,
    " In that moment I decided to do something different.": 1,
    "I decided to tell him the truth.": 1,
    " I decided to tell him that he was going to die and that there was nothing I could do for him.": 1,
    " His reaction shocked me to this day.": 1,
    " He simply laid back and had a look of acceptance on his face.": 1,
    "He was not met with that terror or fear that I thought he would be.": 1,
    " He simply laid there, and as I looked into his eyes, I saw inner peace and acceptance.": 1,
    "From that moment forward, I decided it was not my place to comfort the dying with my lies.": 1,
    " Having responded to many cases since then, where patients were in their last moments and there was nothing I could do for them, in almost every case, they have all had the same reaction to the truth of inner peace and acceptance.": 1,
    " In fact, there are three patterns I have observed in all these cases.": 1,
    " The first pattern always kind of shocked me.": 1,
    "Regardless of religious belief or cultural background, there's a need for forgiveness.": 1,
    " Whether they call it sin or they simply say they have a regret.": 1,
    "Their guilt is universal.": 1,
    " I had once cared for an elderly gentleman who was having a massive heart attack as I prepared myself and my equipment for his imminent cardiac arrest.": 1,
    " I began to tell the patient of his intimate demise.": 1,
    "He already knew by my tone of voice and body language.": 1,
    "As I placed the defibrillator pads on his chest, prepping for what was going to happen, he looked me in the eye and said,": 1,
    " I wish I had spent more time with my children and grandchildren instead of being selfish with my time.": 1,
    " Faced with imminent death, all he wanted was forgiveness.": 1,
    " The second pattern I observe is the need for remembrance.": 1,
    " Whether it was to be remembered in my thoughts or their loved ones, they needed to feel that they would be living on.": 1,
    "There's a need for immortality within the hearts and thoughts of their loved ones, myself, my crew, or anyone around.": 1,
    " Countless times I have had a patient look me in the eyes and say, will you remember me?": 1,
    " The final pattern I observed always touched me the deepest, to the soul.": 1,
    "The dying need to know that their life had meaning.": 1,
    " They need to know that they did not waste their life on meaningless tasks.": 1,
    " This came to me very, very early in my career.": 1,
    " I had responded to a call.": 1,
    "There was a female in her late 50s severely pinned within a vehicle.": 1,
    "She had BT bond at a high rate of speed.": 1,
    " Critical, critical condition.": 1,
    "As the fire department worked to remove her from the car, I climbed in to begin to render care.": 1,
    " As we talked, she had said to me there was so much more I wanted to do with my life.": 1,
    " she had felt she had not left her mark on this earth.": 1,
    " As we talked further, it would turn out that she was a mother of two adopted children who were both on their way to medical school.": 1,
    " Because of her, two children had a chance they never would have had otherwise and would go on to save lives in the medical field as medical doctors.": 1,
    " It would end up taking 45 minutes to free her from the vehicle.": 1,
    "However, she perished prior to freeing her.": 1,
    " I believed what you saw in the movies.": 1,
    "You're in those last moments that is strictly terror, fear.": 1,
    "I've come to realize, regardless of the circumstance, it's generally meant with peace and acceptance.": 1,
    " That is the littlest things, the littlest moments, the littlest things you brought into the world that gives you peace in those final moments.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
