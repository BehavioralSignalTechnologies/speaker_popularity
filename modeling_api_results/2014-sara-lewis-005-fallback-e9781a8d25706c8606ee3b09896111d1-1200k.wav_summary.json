    " As a scientist, and also as a human being, I've been trying to make myself susceptible to wonder.": 1,
    " I think Jason Webley last night called it, conspiring to be part of the magic.": 1,
    " So it's fortunate that my career as a biologist lets me dive deeply into the lives of some truly wondrous creatures that share our planet.": 1,
    "Fireflies.": 1,
    " Now, for many of you, I know that Fireflies might conjure up some really great memories.": 1,
    "Childhood.": 1,
    "Summertime.": 1,
    "Even other TED Talks.": 1,
    "Maybe something like this.": 1,
    " My seduction into the world of fireflies began when I was back in graduate school.": 1,
    " One evening I was sitting out in my backyard in North Carolina.": 1,
    " And suddenly...": 1,
    " These silent sparks rose up all around me.": 1,
    "And I began to wonder, how do these creatures make light?": 1,
    "And what's with all this flashing?": 1,
    "Are they talking to one another?": 1,
    " And what happens after the lights go out?": 1,
    "I've been lucky enough to answer some of these questions as I've explored this nocturnal world.": 1,
    " Now if you've ever seen or even heard about fireflies, then you'll know how magically they can transform our everyday landscape into something ethereal and otherworldly.": 1,
    "And this happens around the globe.": 1,
    " Like this hillside in the smoky mountains that I saw transformed into a living cascade of light by the eerie glows of these blue ghost fireflies.": 1,
    " or a roadside river that I visited in Japan as it was giving birth to the slow, floating flashes of these Genji fireflies.": 1,
    " Or in Malaysia, the mangrove trees that I watched blossom nightly, not with flowers, but with the lights of a thousand clip-clip fireflies all blinking together in stunning synchrony.": 1,
    " These luminous landscapes still fill me with wonder, and they keep me connected to the magic of the natural world.": 1,
    "And I find it amazing that they're created by these tiny insects.": 1,
    " In person, fireflies are charming.": 1,
    "They're charismatic.": 1,
    "They've been celebrated in art and in poetry for centuries.": 1,
    " As I've traveled around the world, I've met many thoughtful people who've told me that God put fireflies on earth for humans to enjoy.": 1,
    " other creatures can enjoy them too.": 1,
    "I think these graceful insects are truly miraculous because they so beautifully illuminate the creative improvisation of evolution": 1,
    " They've been shaped by two powerful evolutionary forces, natural selection, the struggle for survival, and sexual selection, the struggle for reproductive opportunity.": 1,
    " As a firefly junkie, the past 20 years have been quite an exciting ride.": 1,
    "Together with my students at Tufts University and other colleagues, we've made lots of new discoveries about fireflies.": 1,
    " their courtship and sex lives, their treachery and murder.": 1,
    "So today I'd like to share with you just a couple of tales that we've brought back from our collective adventures into this hidden world.": 1,
    " Fireflies belong to a very beautiful and diverse group of insects, the beetles.": 1,
    " Worldwide, there are more than 2,000 firefly species.": 1,
    "And these have evolved remarkably diverse courtship signals, that is different ways to find and attract mates.": 1,
    " Around 150 million years ago, the very first fireflies probably looked like this.": 1,
    "They flew during the daytime, and they didn't light up.": 1,
    " Instead, males use their fantastic antennae to sniff out perfumes given off by their females.": 1,
    " In other fireflies, it's only the females who light up.": 1,
    "They're attractively plump and wingless.": 1,
    "So every night, they climb up onto perches and they glow brightly for hours to attract their flying but unlit males.": 1,
    " And still other fireflies, both sexes use quick, bright flashes to find their mates.": 1,
    " Here in North America, we have more than 100 different kinds of firefly that have the remarkable ability to shine energy out from their bodies in the form of light.": 1,
    " How do they do that?": 1,
    "It seems totally magical.": 1,
    "But these bioluminescent signals arise from carefully orchestrated chemical reactions that happen inside the firefly lantern.": 1,
    " The main star is an enzyme called luciferase, which in the course of evolution has figured out a way to wrap its tiny arms": 1,
    " around an even smaller molecule called luciferin, in the process getting it so excited that it actually gives off light.": 1,
    "Incredible.": 1,
    " But how could these bright lights have benefited some proto-firefly?": 1,
    " To answer this question, we need to flip back in the family album to some baby pictures.": 1,
    "Fireflies completely reinvent their bodies as they grow.": 1,
    " They spend the vast majority of their lifetime, up to two years, in this larval form.": 1,
    "Their main goal here, like my teenagers, is to eat and grow.": 1,
    " and firefly light first originated in these juveniles.": 1,
    "Every single firefly larva can light up, even when their adults can't.": 1,
    " What's the point to being so conspicuous?": 1,
    " Well, we know that these juveniles make nasty tasting chemicals that help them survive their extended childhood.": 1,
    "So we think these lights first evolved as a warning.": 1,
    " a neon sign that says, toxic, stay away to any would-be predators.": 1,
    " It took many million years before these bright lights evolved into a smart communication tool that could be used not just to ward off potential predators, but to bring in potential mates.": 1,
    " Driven now by sexual selection, some adult fireflies, like this proud male, evolved a shiny new glow-in-the-dark lantern that would let them take courtship to a whole new level.": 1,
    " These adults only live a few weeks, and now they're single-mindedly focused on sex.": 1,
    "That is, on propelling their genes into the next firefly generation.": 1,
    " So we can follow this male out into the field as he joins hundreds of other males who are all showing off their new courtship signals.": 1,
    " It's amazing to think that the luminous displays we admire here and in fact everywhere around the world are actually the silent love songs of male fireflies": 1,
    " They're flying and flashing their hearts out.": 1,
    "I still find it very romantic.": 1,
    " but meanwhile we're all the females": 1,
    " Well, they're lounging down below surveying their options.": 1,
    "They have plenty of males to choose from, and these females turn out to be very picky.": 1,
    " When a female sees a flash from an especially attractive male, she'll aim her lantern in his direction and give him a flashback.": 1,
    " It's her come hither sign.": 1,
    "So he flies closer and he flashes again.": 1,
    "If she still likes him, they'll strike up a conversation.": 1,
    " These creatures speak their love in the language of light.": 1,
    "So what exactly do these females consider sexy?": 1,
    " we decided to conduct some Firefly opinion polls to find out.": 1,
    "When we tested females using blinking LED lights, we discovered they prefer males who give longer lasting flashes.": 1,
    " I know you're wondering, what gives these males their sex appeal?": 1,
    "Now we get to see what happens when the lights go out.": 1,
    " The first thing we discovered is that once a male and female hook up like this, they stay together all night long.": 1,
    "And when we looked inside to see what might be happening, we discovered a surprising new twist, the firefly sex.": 1,
    " While they're mating, the male is busy giving the female not just his sperm, but also a nutrient-filled package called a nuptial gift.": 1,
    " we can zoom in to look more closely inside this mating pair.": 1,
    "We can actually see the gift, it's shown here in red, as it's being passed from the male to the female.": 1,
    " What makes this gift so valuable is that it's packed with protein that the female will use to provision her eggs.": 1,
    " So females are keeping their eyes on this prize as they size up potential mates.": 1,
    "We discovered that females use male flash signals to try to predict which males have the biggest gifts to offer because this bling": 1,
    " helps the female lay more eggs and ultimately launch more of her own offspring into the next generation.": 1,
    " So it's not all sweetness and light.": 1,
    "Firefly romance is risky.": 1,
    "For the most part, these adult fireflies don't get eaten because, like their juveniles, they can manufacture toxins that are repellent": 1,
    " to birds and other insectivores.": 1,
    "But somewhere along the line, one particular group of fireflies somehow lost the metabolic machinery needed to make their own protective toxins.": 1,
    " This evolutionary flaw, which was discovered by my colleague, Tom Eisner, has driven these fireflies to take their bright lights out into the night with treacherous intent.": 1,
    " Dubbed femme fatale by Jim Lloyd, another colleague, these females have figured out how to target the males of other firefly species.": 1,
    " So the hunt begins with the predator she's shown here in the lower left, where she's sitting quietly and eavesdropping on the courtship conversation of her intended prey.": 1,
    "And here's how it might go.": 1,
    "First, the prey male flashes.": 1,
    " Do you love me?": 1,
    "His own female response.": 1,
    "Maybe.": 1,
    "So then he flashes again.": 1,
    " But this time the predator sneaks in a reply that cleverly mimics exactly what the other female just said.": 1,
    "She's not looking for love.": 1,
    "She's looking for toxins.": 1,
    " If she's good, she can lure this male close enough to reach out and grab him.": 1,
    "And he's not just a light snack.": 1,
    " Over the next hour, she slowly exsanguinates this male, leaving behind just some gory remains.": 1,
    " Unable to make their own toxins, these females resort to drinking the blood of other fireflies to get these protective chemicals.": 1,
    " So, a Firefly Vampire.": 1,
    " brought to you by Natural Selection.": 1,
    " We still have a lot to learn about fireflies, but it looks like many stories will remain untold, because around the world, firefly populations are blinking out.": 1,
    " The main culprit?": 1,
    "Habitat loss.": 1,
    "Pretty much everywhere, the fields and forests, the mangroves and meadows that fireflies need to survive are giving way to development and to sprawl.": 1,
    " Here's another problem.": 1,
    "We've conquered darkness.": 1,
    "But in the process, we spill so much extra light out into the night that it disrupts the lives of other creatures.": 1,
    " And fireflies are especially sensitive to light pollution because it obscures the signals that they use to find their mates.": 1,
    " Do we really need fireflies?": 1,
    "After all, they're just one tiny bit of Earth's biodiversity.": 1,
    "Yet, every time a species is lost, it's like extinguishing a room full of candles, one by one.": 1,
    " you might not notice when the first few flames flicker out.": 1,
    " But in the end, you're left sitting in darkness.": 1,
    " As we work together to craft a planetary future, I hope we can find a way to keep these bright lights shining.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
