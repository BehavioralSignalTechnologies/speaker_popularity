    "I want you there.": 2,
    " Six months ago, I got an email from a man in Israel who had read one of my books.": 1,
    "And the email said, you don't know me, but I'm your twelfth cousin.": 1,
    " And it said, I have a family tree with 80,000 people on it, including you, Karl Marx, and several European aristocrats.": 1,
    " Now, I did not know what to make of this.": 1,
    "Part of me was like, okay, when's he gonna ask me to wire $10,000 to his Nigerian bank, right?": 1,
    " I also thought, 80,000 relatives.": 1,
    "Do I want that?": 1,
    "I have enough trouble with some of the ones I have already.": 1,
    "And I won't name names, but you know who you are.": 1,
    " But another part of me said, this is remarkable.": 1,
    "Here I am alone in my office, but I'm not alone at all.": 1,
    "I'm connected to 80,000 people around the world.": 1,
    "And that's": 1,
    " four Madison Square gardens full of cousins.": 1,
    "And some of them are going to be great and some of them are going to be irritating, but they're all related to me.": 1,
    " So this email inspired me to dive into genealogy, which I always thought was a very staid and proper field, but it turns out it's going through a fascinating revolution and a controversial one.": 1,
    " Partly this is because of DNA and genetic testing, but partly it's because of the internet.": 1,
    " There are sites that now take the Wikipedia approach to family trees, collaboration and crowdsourcing.": 1,
    "And what you do is you load your family tree on,": 1,
    " And then these sites search to see if the AJ Jacobs in your tree is the same as the AJ Jacobs in another tree.": 1,
    "And if it is, then you can combine.": 1,
    " And then you combine and combine and combine until you get these massive mega family trees with thousands of people on them, or even millions.": 1,
    " I'm on something on Genie called the World Family Tree, which has no less than, jaw dropping, 75 million people.": 1,
    " So that's 75 million people connected by blood or marriage, sometimes both.": 1,
    " It's in all seven continents, including Antarctica.": 1,
    "I'm on it.": 1,
    "Many of you are on it, whether you know it or not.": 1,
    "And you can see the links.": 1,
    "Here's my cousin, Gwyneth Paltrow.": 1,
    " She has no idea I exist, but we are officially cousins.": 1,
    "We have just 17 links between us, and there's my cousin Barack Obama.": 1,
    " And he is my aunt's fifth-grade aunt's husband's father's wife's seventh-grade nephew.": 1,
    "So, practically my older brother.": 1,
    " and my cousin, of course, the actor, Kevin Bacon.": 1,
    " who is my first cousin, twice removed, wife's, niece's, husband's first cousin, once removed, niece's husband.": 1,
    "So six degrees of Kevin Bacon, plus or minus several degrees.": 1,
    " Now I'm not boasting because all of you have famous people and historical figures in your tree because we are all connected.": 1,
    "And 75 million may seem like a lot, but": 1,
    " In a few years, it's quite likely we will have a family tree with all, almost all, seven billion people on earth.": 1,
    "But does it really matter?": 1,
    "You know, what's the importance?": 1,
    " And I do think it is important, and I'll give you five reasons why really quickly.": 1,
    "First, it's got scientific value.": 1,
    "This is an unprecedented history of the human race.": 1,
    " And it's giving us valuable data about how diseases are inherited, how people migrate.": 1,
    "And there's a team of scientists at MIT right now studying the world family tree.": 1,
    " Number two, it brings history alive.": 1,
    "I found out I'm connected to Albert Einstein.": 1,
    "So I told my seven-year-old son that.": 1,
    " He was totally engaged.": 1,
    "Now Albert Einstein is not some dead white guy with weird hair.": 1,
    "He's Uncle Albert.": 1,
    " And my son wanted to know, you know, what did he say?": 1,
    "What is E equals MC squared?": 1,
    "I also, it's not all good news.": 1,
    "I found a link to Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killer.": 1,
    "But I will say that's on my wife's side.": 1,
    " I want to make that clear.": 1,
    "Sorry, honey.": 1,
    "Number three, interconnectedness.": 1,
    "We all come from the same ancestor.": 1,
    " And you don't have to believe the literal Bible version, but scientists talk about Y-chromosomal atom and mitochondrial Eve.": 1,
    " And these were about 100,000 to 300,000 years ago.": 1,
    "We all have a bit of their DNA in us.": 1,
    "They are our great-great-great-great-great-great, continue that for about 7,000 times, grandparents.": 1,
    " And so that means we literally all are biological cousins as well.": 1,
    "And estimates vary, but probably the farthest cousin you have on Earth is about a 50th cousin.": 1,
    " Now, it's not just ancestors we share, descendants.": 1,
    "If you have kids, look, and they have kids, look how quickly the descendants accumulate.": 1,
    " So in 10, 12 generations, you're going to have thousands of offspring and millions of offspring.": 1,
    "Number four, a kinder world.": 1,
    " Now, I know that there are family feuds.": 1,
    "I have three sons, so I see how they fight.": 1,
    "But I think that there's also a human bias to treat your family a little better than strangers.": 1,
    "I think this tree is going to be bad news for bigots because": 1,
    " They're going to have to realize that they are cousins with thousands of people in whatever ethnic group they happen to have issues with.": 1,
    "And I think you look back at history.": 1,
    " And a lot of the terrible things we've done to each other is because one group thinks another group is subhuman.": 1,
    "And you can't do that anymore.": 1,
    "We're not just part of the same species, we're part of the same family.": 1,
    "We share 99.9% of our DNA.": 1,
    " Now, the final one is number five, a democratizing effect.": 1,
    "Some genealogy has an elitist strain, you know, like people say, oh, I'm descended from Mary, Queen of Scots, and you're not, so you cannot join my country club.": 1,
    " But that's really going to be hard to do now, because everyone is related.": 1,
    "I'm descended from Mary Queen of Scotch, you know, by marriage, but still.": 1,
    " So it's really a fascinating time in the history of family because it's changing so fast.": 1,
    "There's gay marriage and sperm donors.": 1,
    " And there's intermarriage on an unprecedented scale.": 1,
    "And this makes some of my more conservative cousins a little nervous.": 1,
    "But I actually think it's a good thing.": 1,
    "I think the more inclusive the idea of family is, the better.": 1,
    " Because then you have more potential caretakers.": 1,
    "And as my aunt's eighth cousin twice removed, Hillary Clinton says, it takes a village.": 1,
    " So I have all these hundreds and thousands, millions of new cousins.": 1,
    "I thought, what can I do with this information?": 1,
    "And that's when I decided, why not throw a party?": 1,
    " So that's what I'm doing.": 1,
    "And you're all invited.": 1,
    "Next year, next summer, I will be hosting what I hope is the biggest and best family reunion in history.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    "It's going to be at the New York Hall of Science, which is a great venue, but it's also on the site of the former World's Fair.": 1,
    " which is, I think, very appropriate because I see this as a family reunion meets a world's fair.": 1,
    "There's going to be exhibits and food, music.": 1,
    "Paul McCartney is 11 steps away, so I'm hoping he brings his guitar.": 1,
    " He hasn't RSVP'd yet, but fingers crossed.": 1,
    "There was going to be a day of speakers, of fascinating cousins.": 1,
    "It's early, but I've got some lined up.": 1,
    " Cass Sunstein, my cousin who is perhaps the most brilliant legal scholar we'll be talking, he was a former member of the Obama": 1,
    " administration.": 1,
    "And on the other side of the political spectrum, George H.W.": 1,
    "Bush, the number 41, the father, he has agreed to participate.": 1,
    "And Nick Kroll, the comedian, and Dr. Oz": 1,
    " and many more to come.": 1,
    "And of course, the most important is that you, I want you guys there.": 1,
    "And I invite you to go to globalfamilyreunion.org and": 1,
    " and figure out how you're on the family tree, because these are big issues, family and tribe.": 1,
    " I don't know all the answers, but I have a lot of smart relatives, including you guys.": 1,
    "So together, I think we can figure it out.": 1,
    "Only together can we solve these big problems.": 1,
    "So, cousin to cousin.": 1,
    " I thank you.": 1,
    "I can't wait to see you.": 1,
    "Goodbye.": 1
