    "Yes?": 3,
    "Right?": 2,
    " Why?": 2,
    "Why?": 2,
    " Okay?": 2,
    "So you see it that way.": 2,
    " But I want to start with a game.": 1,
    "And to win this game, all you have to do is see the reality that's in front of you as it really is.": 1,
    "So we have two panels here of colored dots.": 1,
    " And one of those dots is the same in the two panels.": 1,
    "And you have to tell me which one.": 1,
    " The gray one, the green one, and say the orange one.": 1,
    "So by a show of hands, we'll start with the easiest one.": 1,
    "Show of hands, how many people think it's the gray one?": 1,
    " Really, okay?": 1,
    "How many people think it's the green one?": 1,
    " And how many people think it's the orange one?": 1,
    " So pretty even split.": 1,
    " Let's find out what the reality is.": 1,
    "Here is the orange one.": 1,
    " Alright, here's the green one.": 1,
    " And here's the grey one.": 1,
    " So for all of you saw that, you're a complete realist.": 1,
    "All right?": 1,
    " So this is pretty amazing actually, isn't it?": 1,
    "Because nearly every living system has evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another.": 1,
    "So for us, seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does.": 1,
    "And yet, even at this most fundamental level,": 1,
    " Context is everything.": 1,
    "What I'm going to talk about is not that context is everything, but why is context everything?": 1,
    " answering that question that tells us not only why we see what we do, but who we are as individuals and who we are as a society.": 1,
    " But first we have to ask another question, which is, what is color for?": 1,
    "And instead of telling you, I'll just show you.": 1,
    "What you see here is a jungle scene, and you see the surfaces according to the amount of light that those surfaces reflect.": 1,
    " Now, can any of you see the predator that's about to jump out at you?": 1,
    "And if you haven't seen it yet, you're dead.": 1,
    " Can anyone see it?": 1,
    "Anyone?": 1,
    "No?": 1,
    "Now let's see the surfaces according to the quality of light that they reflect.": 1,
    "And now you see it.": 1,
    " So color enables us to see the similarities and differences between surfaces according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect.": 1,
    "But what you've just done is in many respects mathematically impossible.": 1,
    "Because as Barclay tells us, we have no direct access to our physical world other than through our senses.": 1,
    "And the light that falls onto our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world, not only the color of objects,": 1,
    " but also the color of their illumination and the color of the space between us and those objects.": 1,
    "You vary any one of those parameters and you'll change the color of the light that falls onto your eye.": 1,
    " This is a huge problem because it means that the same image could have an infinite number of possible real-world sources.": 1,
    " So let me show you what I mean.": 1,
    "Imagine that this is the back of your eye, okay?": 1,
    "And these are two projections from the world.": 1,
    "They're identical in every single way, identical in shape,": 1,
    " size, spectral content, they are the same as far as your eye is concerned.": 1,
    "And yet, they come from completely different sources.": 1,
    " The one on the right comes from a yellow surface in shadow, oriented facing the left, viewed through a pinkish medium.": 1,
    " The one on the left comes from an orange surface under direct light, facing to the right, viewed through a sort of a bluish medium.": 1,
    "Completely different meanings.": 1,
    " giving rise to the exact same retinal information.": 1,
    "And yet, it's only the retinal information that we get.": 1,
    "So how on earth do we even see?": 1,
    " So if you remember anything in this next 18 minutes, remember this, that the light that falls onto your eye, sensory information, is meaningless, because it could mean literally anything.": 1,
    " And what's true for sensory information is true for information generally.": 1,
    "There's no inherent meaning in information.": 1,
    "It's what we do with that information that matters.": 1,
    " So how do we see?": 1,
    "Well, we see by learning to see.": 1,
    "So the brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns, finding relationships in information, and associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning.": 1,
    " a significance by interacting with the world.": 1,
    "We're very aware of this in the form of more cognitive attributes like language.": 1,
    "So I'm going to give you some letter strings, and I want you to read them out for me, if you can.": 1,
    " What are you reading?": 1,
    "Half the letters are missing.": 1,
    "There's no A prior reason why an H has to go between that W and A. But you put one there.": 1,
    "Because in the statistics of your past experience, it would have been useful to do so.": 1,
    "So you do so again.": 1,
    " And yet you don't put a letter after that first T. Why?": 1,
    "Because it wouldn't have been useful in the past.": 1,
    "So you don't do it again.": 1,
    " So let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality, even at the simplest thing the brain does, which is color.": 1,
    "So if I could have the lights down up here.": 1,
    "I want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same.": 1,
    "One is simply the flipping of the other.": 1,
    " Now I want you to look at that dot between the green and the red, OK?": 1,
    "And I want you to stare at that dot.": 1,
    "Don't look anywhere else.": 1,
    "And we're going to look at that for about 30 seconds, which is a bit of a killer in an 18-minute talk.": 1,
    " But I really want you to learn, and I'll tell you, don't look anywhere else.": 1,
    " And I'll tell you what's happening inside your head.": 1,
    "Your brain is learning, and it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination.": 1,
    "The left side of its visual field is under green illumination.": 1,
    "That's what it's learning.": 1,
    " Now, when I tell you, I want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes.": 1,
    " So why don't you do that now?": 1,
    " Can we have the lights up again?": 1,
    "So I take it from your response, they don't look the same anymore, right?": 1,
    "Because your brain is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light and the left one is still under green light.": 1,
    "That's your new normal.": 1,
    " So what does this mean for context?": 1,
    "It means I can take these two identical squares and I can put them in light and dark surrounds.": 1,
    "Now the one on the dark surround looks lighter than the one on the light surround.": 1,
    " What's significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter, it's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past.": 1,
    " So I'll show you what I mean.": 1,
    "Here we have that exact same illusion.": 1,
    "We have two identical tiles on the left, one in a dark surround, one in a light surround, and the same thing over on the right.": 1,
    " Now what I want to do is I want to reveal those two scenes, but I'm not going to change anything within those boxes.": 1,
    "Accept their meaning and see what happens to your perception.": 1,
    " Notice that on the left, the two tiles look nearly completely opposite, one very white and one very dark.": 1,
    "Whereas on the right, the two tiles look nearly the same.": 1,
    " And yet, there is still one on a dark's round and one on a light's round.": 1,
    "Because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow,": 1,
    " it would have to be more reflective, just the laws of physics.": 1,
    "Whereas on the right, the information is consistent with those two tiles being under the same light.": 1,
    "If they're under the same light, reflecting the same amount of light to your eye,": 1,
    " then they must be equally reflective.": 1,
    "Which means we can bring all this information together to create some incredibly strong illusions.": 1,
    "This is one I made a few years ago.": 1,
    "And you'll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top.": 1,
    " and a bright orange tile at the side.": 1,
    "That is your perceptual reality.": 1,
    "The physical reality is that those two tiles are the same.": 1,
    " Here you see four gray tiles on your left, seven gray tiles on the right.": 1,
    "I'm not gonna change those tiles at all, but I'm gonna reveal the rest of the scene and see what happens to your perception.": 1,
    " The four blue tiles on the left are gray.": 1,
    "The seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray.": 1,
    "They are the same, okay?": 1,
    "Don't believe me?": 1,
    "Let's watch it again.": 1,
    " What's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion.": 1,
    "So here we have, let's turn this around, a diamond.": 1,
    " And what I'm going to do is I'm going to hold it here and I'm going to spin it.": 1,
    " And for all of you, you'll see it probably spinning this direction.": 1,
    "Now I want you to keep looking at it.": 1,
    " move your eyes around, blink, maybe close one eye, and suddenly it'll flip and start spinning in the opposite direction.": 1,
    "Raise your hand if you got that.": 1,
    "Keep blinking.": 1,
    "Every time you blink, it'll switch.": 1,
    " Right?": 1,
    "So I can ask you, which direction is it rotating?": 1,
    " How do you know?": 1,
    " Your brain doesn't know because both are equally likely.": 1,
    "So depending on where it looks, it flips between the two possibilities.": 1,
    " Are we the only ones that see illusions?": 1,
    "The answer to this question is no.": 1,
    "Even the beautiful bumblebee, with its mere one million brain cells, which is 250 times fewer cells than you have one retina,": 1,
    " sees illusions, does the most complicated things that even our most sophisticated computers can't do.": 1,
    "So in my lab, we of course work on bumblebees because we can completely control their experience and see how that alters the architecture of their brain.": 1,
    "And we do this in what we call the Bee Matrix.": 1,
    " And here you have the hive.": 1,
    "You can see the queen bee, that large bee in the middle there.": 1,
    "Those are all her daughters, the eggs.": 1,
    "And they go back and forth between this hive and the arena via this tube.": 1,
    " and you'll see one of the bees come out here.": 1,
    "You see she has a little number on her?": 1,
    " Yeah, there's another one coming out, she also has a number on her.": 1,
    "Now they're not born that way, right?": 1,
    "We pull them out, put them in the fridge, and they fall asleep, and then you can superglue little numbers on them, right?": 1,
    " And now in this experiment, they get a reward if they go to the blue flowers.": 1,
    "Okay, and they land on the flower, they stick their tongue in there, called a proboscis, and they drink sugar water.": 1,
    "Now, she's drinking a glass of water that's about that big to you and I. We'll do that about three times and then fly.": 1,
    " All right.": 1,
    " And sometimes they learn not to go to the blue, but to go to where the other bees go.": 1,
    "So they copy each other.": 1,
    "They can count to five.": 1,
    "They can recognize faces.": 1,
    "And here she comes down the ladder, and she'll come into the hive, find an empty honey pot, and throw up.": 1,
    "And that's honey.": 1,
    "Now remember...": 1,
    " She's supposed to be going to the blue flowers, but what are these bees doing in the upper right corner?": 1,
    "It looks like they're going to green flowers.": 1,
    " Now, are they getting it wrong?": 1,
    "And the answer to the question is no.": 1,
    "Those are actually blue flowers, but those are blue flowers under green light.": 1,
    " so they're using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle, which is exactly what we do.": 1,
    " So, allusions are often used, especially in art, in the words of a more contemporary artist, to demonstrate the fragility of our senses.": 1,
    "This is complete rubbish.": 1,
    "The senses aren't fragile.": 1,
    "If they were, we wouldn't be here.": 1,
    " Instead, color tells us something completely different, that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is.": 1,
    "We can't.": 1,
    "Instead, the brain evolved to see the world the way it was useful to see in the past.": 1,
    " And how we see is by continually redefining normality.": 1,
    " So, how can we take this incredible capacity of plasticity of the brain and get people to experience their world differently?": 1,
    " Well, one of the ways we do in my lab and studio is we translate the light into sound, and we enable people to hear their visual world.": 1,
    "Okay?": 1,
    "And they can navigate the world using their ears.": 1,
    " Here's David in the right, and he's holding a camera.": 1,
    "On the left is what his camera sees.": 1,
    "And you'll see there's a line, a faint line going across that image.": 1,
    "That line is broken into 32 squares.": 1,
    " And each square, we calculate the average color, and then we just simply translate that into sound.": 1,
    "And now he's going to turn around, close his eyes,": 1,
    " and find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed.": 1,
    " He finds it.": 1,
    "Amazing, right?": 1,
    "So not only can we create a prosthetic for the visually impaired, but we can also investigate how people literally make sense of the world.": 1,
    "But we can also do something else.": 1,
    "We can also make music with color.": 1,
    " So working with kids, they created images.": 1,
    " thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them.": 1,
    "And then we translated these images.": 1,
    "And this is one of those images.": 1,
    "And this is a six-year-old child composing a piece of music for a 32-piece orchestra.": 1,
    "And this is what it sounds like.": 1,
    " So a six-year-old child, okay?": 1,
    "Now, what does all this mean?": 1,
    " What this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature.": 1,
    "We're not defined by our essential properties, by the bits that make us up.": 1,
    "We're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment, by our ecology.": 1,
    " And that ecology is necessarily relative, historical, and empirical.": 1,
    " So what I'd like to finish with is this over here, because what I've been trying to do is really celebrate uncertainty, because I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding.": 1,
    " So if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain, I'd like to do this one.": 1,
    "So if we have the lights down, and what we have...": 1,
    " Here.": 1,
    " Can everyone see 25 purple surfaces on your left and 25, call it, yellowish surfaces on your right?": 1,
    "So now what I'm going to do, I'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here.": 1,
    " under yellow illumination by simply putting a filter behind them.": 1,
    " Now you can see that changes the light that's coming through there.": 1,
    "Because now the light's going through a...": 1,
    " yellowish filter and then a purplish filter.": 1,
    "And I'm going to do this opposite on the left here.": 1,
    "I'm going to put the middle nine": 1,
    " under a purplish light.": 1,
    "Now, some of you have noticed that the consequence is that the light coming through those middle nine on the right": 1,
    " or your left, is exactly the same as the light coming through the middle nine on your right.": 1,
    "Agreed?": 1,
    "Okay.": 1,
    "So they are physically the same.": 1,
    "Let's pull the covers off.": 1,
    " Now remember...": 1,
    " you know that the middle nine are exactly the same.": 1,
    "Do they look the same?": 1,
    " No.": 1,
    "Question is, is that an illusion?": 1,
    "And I'll leave you with that.": 1,
    "So thank you very much.": 1
