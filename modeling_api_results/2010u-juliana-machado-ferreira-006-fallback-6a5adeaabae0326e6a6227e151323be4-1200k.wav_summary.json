    " Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna, especially birds, and mainly to supply the pet market.": 1,
    " with thousands of animals taken from nature every month and transported far from their origins to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo.": 1,
    " It is estimated that all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil withdraw from nature almost 38 million animals every year, a business worth almost 2 billion dollars.": 1,
    " The police intercept these huge cargos with live animals intended to supply the pet market, or they seize the animals directly from the people's houses.": 1,
    " And this is how we end up every month with thousands of seized animals.": 1,
    "And for us to understand what happens with them, we're going to follow bread.": 1,
    " In the eyes of many people, after the animals are seized, they say, yay, justice has been served, the good guys arrived,": 1,
    " took the cute mistreated animals from the hands of the evil traffickers, and everyone lived happily ever after.": 1,
    " But did they?": 1,
    "Actually, no.": 1,
    "And this is where many of our problems begin, because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals.": 1,
    " In Brazil, they are usually first sent to governmental triage facilities, in which most of the cases the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers.": 1,
    " In 2002, these centers received 45,000 animals, of which 37,000 were birds, and the police estimates that we see only 5% of what's being trafficked.": 1,
    " Some lucky ones, and among them, Brad, go to serious rehabilitation centers after that, and in these places they are cared for.": 1,
    " They train their flying, they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature, and they are able to socialize with others from the same species.": 1,
    " But then what?": 1,
    "The Brazilian Ornithological Society, so now we're talking only birds, claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature,": 1,
    " Therefore, it would be too risky to release these animals, both for the released and for the natural populations.": 1,
    "They also claim that we spend too many resources in the rehabilitation.": 1,
    " Following this argument, they suggest that all the birds seized from non-threatened species should be euthanized.": 1,
    " However, this would mean having killed 26,267 birds only in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, only in 2006.": 1,
    " But some researchers, myself included, some NGOs, and some people from the Brazilian government believe there is an alternative.": 1,
    " We think that if and when the animals meet certain criteria concerning their health, behavior, inferred origin, and whatever we know about the natural populations,": 1,
    " then technically responsible releases are possible, both for the well-being of the individual": 1,
    " and for the conservation of the species and the ecosystems, because we will be returning genes for these populations, which could be important for them": 1,
    " in facing environmental challenges, and also we could be returning potential seed dispersers, predators, praise, etc.": 1,
    " All of these were released by us.": 1,
    "On the top, the turtles are just enjoying freedom.": 1,
    " On the middle, this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release, and on the bottom, my personal favourite, the little male over there, four hours after his release, he was together with a wild female.": 1,
    " So this is not new, people have been doing this around the world, but it's still a big issue in Brazil.": 1,
    "We believe we have performed responsible releases, we registered release animals mating in nature, and": 1,
    " having chicks, so these genes are indeed going back to the populations.": 1,
    "However, this is still a minority for that very lack of knowledge.": 1,
    " So I say let's study more, let's shed light on this issue, let's do whatever we can.": 1,
    "I'm devoting my career to that and I'm here to urge": 1,
    " Each and every one of you, do whatever is in your reach.": 1,
    "Talk to your neighbor.": 1,
    "Teach your children.": 1,
    "Make sure your pet is from a legal breeder.": 1,
    "We need to act, and act now, before these ones are the only ones left.": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1
