    " I am a PhD student and that means I have a question.": 1,
    "How can we make digital content graspable?": 1,
    "Because you see, on the one hand there is the digital world and no question many things are happening there right now.": 1,
    " And for us humans, it's not quite material.": 1,
    "It's not really there.": 1,
    "It's virtual.": 1,
    " On the other hand, we humans, we live in a physical world.": 1,
    "It's rich, it tastes good, it feels good, it smells good.": 1,
    "So the question is, how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical?": 1,
    "That's my question.": 1,
    " If you look at the eye form with its touch and the Wii with its bodily activity, you can see the tendency it's getting physical.": 1,
    "The question is, what's next?": 1,
    "Now, I have three options that I would like to show you.": 1,
    "The first one is mass.": 1,
    " As humans, we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy.": 1,
    "So could we use that in mobile phones?": 1,
    "Let me show you the weight shifting mobile.": 1,
    " It is a mobile phone shaped box that has iron weight inside which we can move around and you can feel where it's heavy.": 1,
    "We shift the gravitational center of it.": 1,
    " For example, we can augment digital content with physical mass.": 1,
    "So you move around the content on the display, but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device.": 1,
    " Another thing it's good for is navigation.": 1,
    "It can guide you around in a city.": 1,
    "It can tell you by its weight, OK, move right, walk ahead, make a left here.": 1,
    "And the good thing about that is you don't have to look at the device all the time.": 1,
    "You have your eyes free to see the city.": 1,
    " Now, mass is the first thing.": 1,
    "The second thing, that's shape.": 1,
    "We're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in hands.": 1,
    " So if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages, well, that could be thin, right?": 1,
    "But if it has 500 pages, I want to feel that Harry Potter.": 1,
    "It's thick.": 1,
    " So let me show you the shape changing mobile.": 1,
    "Again, it's a mobile phone shape box, and this one can change its shape.": 1,
    " We can play with the shape itself.": 1,
    "For example, it can be thin in your pocket, which we of course want it to be.": 1,
    "But then if you hold it in your hand, it can lean towards you, be thick.": 1,
    "It's like tapered to the downside.": 1,
    "If you change the grasp, we can adjust to that.": 1,
    " It's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use it as an alarm clock.": 1,
    "It stands.": 1,
    "It's fairly simple.": 1,
    " Another thing is, sometimes we watch things on the mobile phone.": 1,
    "They are bigger than the phone itself.": 1,
    "So in that case, like here this map, it's bigger than the phone's screen.": 1,
    " The shape of the phone could tell you, okay, off the screen right here, there was more content.": 1,
    "You can't see it, but it's there.": 1,
    "And you can feel that because it's thicker at that edge.": 1,
    "Shape is the second thing.": 1,
    " The third thing operates on a different level.": 1,
    "As humans we are social, we are empathic and that's great.": 1,
    "Wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive?": 1,
    "Think of a hamster in the pocket.": 1,
    " I can feel it's doing all right.": 1,
    "I don't have to check it.": 1,
    "Let me show you the living mobile phone.": 1,
    "Okay, so once again mobile phone shape box.": 1,
    "But this one, it has a breath and a heartbeat.": 1,
    "It feels very organic.": 1,
    " And you can tell it's it's relaxed right now.": 1,
    "Oh now missed call a new call new girlfriend, maybe very exciting": 1,
    " how do we calm it down hmm you give it a patch behind the ears and and everything is alright again so so that's very intuitive and that's what we want": 1,
    " So what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us.": 1,
    "And I think making it physical is a good way to do that.": 1,
    " behind that is a postulation, namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future, rather than that technology a bit more human.": 1
