    " Thank you.": 2,
    " Hi, I'm an architect.": 1,
    "I'm the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper, like this cardboard tube.": 1,
    "This exhibition is the first one I did using a paper tube.": 1,
    " 1986, much much longer before people start talking about ecological issues and environmental issues.": 1,
    " I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure.": 1,
    "It's very complicated to test the new material for the building.": 1,
    " But this is much stronger than I expected and also it's very easy to waterproof and also because it's industrial material, it's also possible to fireproof.": 1,
    " Then I built the temporary structure.": 1,
    "This is the first temporary building out of paper.": 1,
    "There are 330 tubes, a diameter of 55.": 1,
    " that only 12 tubes diametrized 120 cm for feet wide, as you see in the photo, inside the toilet.": 1,
    "In case you finish with toilet paper, you can tear off the inside wall.": 1,
    "So it's very useful.": 1,
    " Year 2000, there was a big expo in Germany.": 1,
    "I was asked to design the building because the theme of the expo was the environmental issue.": 1,
    " So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tube, recyclable paper.": 1,
    "My goal of the design is not when it's completed.": 1,
    "My goal was when building was demolished,": 1,
    " Because each country makes a lot of pavilions, but after half a year we create a lot of industrial waste.": 1,
    "So my building has to be reused or recycled after the building was recycled.": 1,
    " So that was my design.": 1,
    "Then I was very lucky to win the competition of building the second Pompidou Centre in France, in the city of Metz.": 1,
    " Because I was so poor, I wanted to rent an office in Paris but I couldn't afford.": 1,
    "So I decided to bring my student to Paris to build our office on top of the Pompidou Centre in Paris by ourselves.": 1,
    " So we brought the paper tube and the wooden joint to complete the 35 meter long office.": 1,
    "We stayed there for six years without paying any rent.": 1,
    " But I had a blunt...": 1,
    "I had one big problem.": 1,
    "Because we are part of the exhibition, even my friends wanted to see me, they had to buy tickets to see me.": 1,
    "That was the problem.": 1,
    " Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz.": 1,
    "It's a very popular museum now and I created a big monument for the government.": 1,
    " But then I was very disappointed at my profession as an architect, because we are not helping, we are not working for society, but we are working for privileged people.": 1,
    " Rich people, government, developers, they have money and power.": 1,
    "Those are invisible.": 1,
    "So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture.": 1,
    " That's our profession, even historically same, even now we are doing the same.": 1,
    "So I was very disappointed.": 1,
    "We are not working for society.": 1,
    " Even though there are also many people who lost their houses by natural disaster, but I must say they are no longer a natural disaster.": 1,
    " For example, earthquakes never kill people, but collapse of the building kills people.": 1,
    "That's the responsibility of architects.": 1,
    "Then people need some temporary housing, but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people.": 1,
    " So I thought even us as architects who can involve in the reconstruction of the temporary housing, we can make it better.": 1,
    "So that is why I started working in disaster area.": 1,
    " 1994, there was a big disaster in Rwanda, Africa.": 1,
    "Two tribes, Futsu and Tsuchi, fight each other.": 1,
    "Over two million people became refugees.": 1,
    "But I was so surprised to see the shelter, refugee camp, organized by UN.": 1,
    " They are so poor, and they are freezing with blankets during rainy season, and the shelter built by UN, they are just provided with plastic sheets, and refugees have to cut the trees, and just like this.": 1,
    " But over 2 million people cut trees, this becomes a big heavy deforestation and environmental problem.": 1,
    "That is why they start providing aluminum pipes but aluminum barrels.": 1,
    "Very expensive, they sold them out for money.": 1,
    " then cutting trees again.": 1,
    "So I proposed my idea to improve this situation using this recycled paper tube because this is so cheap.": 1,
    " and also so strong.": 1,
    "But my budget is only US$50 per unit.": 1,
    "We built 50 units to do the monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termite zone.": 1,
    " And then, a year after 1995, in Kobe, Japan, we had a big earthquake.": 1,
    "Nearly 7,000 people were killed in the city, like this Nagata district.": 1,
    " All the city was burned, fire after the earthquake.": 1,
    "And also I found out there are many Vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering in this Catholic church.": 1,
    "All the buildings were totally destroyed.": 1,
    "So I went there.": 1,
    " And also I proposed to Prius, why don't we rebuild the church out of paper jubes?": 1,
    "And he said, oh god, are you crazy?": 1,
    " After a fire, what are you proposing?": 1,
    "So he never trusts me, but I didn't give up.": 1,
    "I started commuting to Kobe and I met the society of Vietnamese people.": 1,
    "They are living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park.": 1,
    " So I proposed to rebuild the fundraising.": 1,
    "I made a paper tube shelter for them.": 1,
    "And in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish, I used beer crates as a foundation.": 1,
    " I asked the Kirin beer company to propose because at that time the Asahi beer company made their plastic beer crate red, which doesn't go with the color of the paper tube.": 1,
    "The color coordination is very important.": 1,
    " And also I still remember we are expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate, but it came with empty.": 1,
    "So I still remember it was so disappointing.": 1,
    " So during the summer with my student, we built over 50 units of the shelters.": 1,
    "Finally, please, finally trust me to rebuild.": 1,
    "He said, as long as you collect money by yourself, bring your student to build, you can do it.": 1,
    "So we spent five weeks to rebuild the church.": 1,
    " It was meant to stay there for three years, but actually it stayed there ten years because people loved it.": 1,
    "Then in Taiwan they had a big earthquake.": 1,
    " and we are proposed to donate this church.": 1,
    "So we dismantle them, we send over to build by volunteer people, it stays there in Taiwan as a permanent church, even now.": 1,
    "So this building becomes a permanent building.": 1,
    " then I wonder what is permanent and what is temporary building.": 1,
    "Even the building made in paper can be permanent as long as people loves it.": 1,
    "Even concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money.": 1,
    " And in 1999, in Turkey, the big earthquake, I went there to use the local material to build the shelter.": 1,
    "2001, in West India, I built also shelter.": 1,
    " In 2004, in Sri Lanka, after the Sumatra earthquake, I rebuilt Islamic Fisherman's Village.": 1,
    " And in 2008, in Chengdu, Sichuan area in China, over nearly 70,000 people were killed, and also especially many schools were destroyed because of the collapse between the authority and the contractor.": 1,
    " I was asked to rebuild the temporary church.": 1,
    "I brought my Japanese student to work with a Chinese student.": 1,
    "In one month, we completed nine classrooms over 500 square meters.": 1,
    " is still used even after the current earthquake in China.": 1,
    "In 2009, in Italy, L'Aquila,": 1,
    " Also, they had a big earthquake, and this is a very interesting photo.": 1,
    "Former Prime Minister, Bill Scone, and Japanese former, former, former, former Prime Minister, Mr. Aso.": 1,
    " You know, because we have to change the Prime Minister every year.": 1,
    "And they are very kind, the folding my model.": 1,
    " I proposed rebuilding the temporary music hall because the Rakuyo era is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed so musicians were moving out.": 1,
    " So I proposed a major.": 1,
    "I'd like to review the temporary auditorium.": 1,
    "He said, as long as you bring your money, you can do it.": 1,
    "And I was very lucky.": 1,
    "Mr. Berlusconi brought the GED Summit and our former prime minister came, so they helped us to collect the money.": 1,
    " and I got half a million euro from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium.": 1,
    "Year 2010 in Heichi,": 1,
    " There are big earthquakes, but it's impossible to fly over.": 1,
    "So I went to Sato Domingo, next to our country, to drive six hours to get to Haichi with the local students in": 1,
    " Santo Domingo to build 50 units of the shelter out of local paper tubes.": 1,
    "This is what happened in Japan two years ago in northern Japan.": 1,
    " After the earthquake and tsunami, people have to be evacuated in the big growth like gymnasium.": 1,
    "But look at this, it's no privacy.": 1,
    "People suffer mentally and physically.": 1,
    " So we went there to build the partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes, just a very simple shelter out of tube frame and the curtain.": 1,
    " However, some of the facility authority doesn't want us to do it because they say simply it's become more difficult to control them.": 1,
    "But it's really necessary to do it.": 1,
    " They don't have enough flat area to build standard government single storey housing like this one.": 1,
    "Look at this, even still government is doing such a poor construction over the temporary housing, so dense.": 1,
    " And it's so messy because there's no storage and the water is leaking.": 1,
    "So I thought we have to make a multi-storey building because there's no land.": 1,
    " and also it's not very comfortable.": 1,
    "So I proposed to the mayor while I was making the petitions.": 1,
    "Finally I met a very nice mayor in the Onagawa village in Miyagi.": 1,
    " He asked me to build three-story housing in a basement ground.": 1,
    "I used the shipping container and also the student helped us to make all the buildings, the furnitures, to make them comfortable.": 1,
    " within the budget of the government, but also the area of the house is exactly the same, but much more comfortable.": 1,
    "Many of the people want to stay here forever, but are very happy to hear that.": 1,
    " Now I'm working in New Zealand, Christchurch.": 1,
    "About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened, also there was a big earthquake and many Japanese students were also killed.": 1,
    " And the most important cathedral of the city, symbol of the Catholic Church, was totally destroyed.": 1,
    "And I was asked to come to rebuild the temple cathedral.": 1,
    " So this is under construction and I'd like to keep building the monument that's beloved by people.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1
