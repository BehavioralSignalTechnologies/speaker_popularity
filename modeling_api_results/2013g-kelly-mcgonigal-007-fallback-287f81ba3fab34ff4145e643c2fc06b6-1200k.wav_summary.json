    " I have a confession to make.": 1,
    " But first, I want you to make a little confession to me.": 1,
    " In the past year, I want you to just raise your hand if you've experienced relatively little stress.": 1,
    "Anyone?": 1,
    " How about a moderate amount of stress?": 1,
    " who's experienced a lot of stress?": 1,
    "Yeah, me too.": 1,
    "But that is not my confession.": 1,
    "My confession is this.": 1,
    "I'm a health psychologist, and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier.": 1,
    " But I fear that something I've been teaching for the last 10 years is doing more harm than good, and it has to do with stress.": 1,
    " For years, I've been telling people stress makes you sick.": 1,
    "It increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease.": 1,
    "Basically, I've turned stress into the enemy.": 1,
    " but I have changed my mind about stress.": 1,
    "And today, I want to change yours.": 1,
    " Let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress.": 1,
    "This study tracked 30,000 adults in the United States for eight years.": 1,
    " And they started by asking people, how much stress have you experienced in the last year?": 1,
    "They also asked, do you believe that stress is harmful for your health?": 1,
    " and then they use public death records to find out who died.": 1,
    " Okay, some bad news first.": 1,
    "People who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43% increased risk of dying.": 1,
    " But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health.": 1,
    " People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die.": 1,
    "In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study, including people who had relatively little stress.": 1,
    " Now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths, 182,000 Americans died prematurely, not from stress, but from the belief that stress is bad for you.": 1,
    " That is over 20,000 deaths a year.": 1,
    "Now if that estimate is correct, that would make believing stress is bad for you, the 15th largest cause of death in the United States last year.": 1,
    " killing more people than skin cancer, HIV AIDS, and homicide.": 1,
    " You can see why this study freaked me out.": 1,
    "Here I've been spending so much energy telling people stress is bad for your health.": 1,
    " So this study got me wondering, can changing how you think about stress make you healthier?": 1,
    "And here the science says yes.": 1,
    "When you change your mind about stress, you can change your body's response to stress.": 1,
    " Now to explain how this works, I want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out.": 1,
    "It's called the social stress test.": 1,
    "You come into the laboratory and you're told,": 1,
    " you have to give a five-minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you.": 1,
    "And to make sure you feel the pressure, there are bright lights and a camera in your face, kind of like this.": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1,
    " And the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging nonverbal feedback like this.": 1,
    " Now that you're sufficiently demoralized, time for part two, a math test.": 1,
    "And unbeknownst to you, the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it.": 1,
    "Now, we're going to all do this together.": 1,
    "It's going to be fun.": 1,
    " for me.": 1,
    "Okay.": 1,
    " I want you all to count backwards from 996 in increments of seven.": 1,
    "You're going to do this out loud as fast as you can, starting with 996.": 1,
    "Go.": 1,
    " Go faster.": 1,
    "Faster, please.": 1,
    "You're going too slow.": 1,
    "Stop, stop, stop, stop.": 1,
    "That guy made a mistake.": 1,
    "We're going to have to start all over again.": 1,
    " You're not very good at this, are you?": 1,
    "Okay, so you get the idea.": 1,
    "Now, if you were actually in this study, you'd probably be a little stressed out.": 1,
    "Your heart might be pounding, you might be breathing faster, maybe breaking out into a sweat.": 1,
    " And normally we interpret these physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren't coping very well with the pressure.": 1,
    " But what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized, was preparing you to meet this challenge?": 1,
    "Now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at Harvard University.": 1,
    " Before they went through the social stress tests, they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful.": 1,
    "That pounding heart is preparing you for action.": 1,
    "If you're breathing faster, it's no problem.": 1,
    "It's getting more oxygen to your brain.": 1,
    " and participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance.": 1,
    "Well, they were less stressed out, less anxious, more confident.": 1,
    "But the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed.": 1,
    " Now, in a typical stress response, your heart rate goes up and your blood vessels constrict like this.": 1,
    " And this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease.": 1,
    "It's not really healthy to be in this state all the time.": 1,
    " But in the study, when participants viewed their stress response as helpful, their blood vessels stayed relaxed, like this.": 1,
    " Their heart was still pounding, but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile.": 1,
    "It actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage.": 1,
    " Over a lifetime of stressful experiences, this one biological change could be the difference between a stress-induced heart attack at age 50 and living well into your 90s.": 1,
    " And this is really what the new science of stress reveals, that how you think about stress matters.": 1,
    " So my goal as a health psychologist has changed.": 1,
    "I no longer want to get rid of your stress.": 1,
    "I want to make you better at stress.": 1,
    "And we just did a little intervention.": 1,
    " If you raised your hand and said you'd had a lot of stress in the last year, we could have saved your life.": 1,
    "Because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress, you're going to remember this talk and you're going to think to yourself, this is my body.": 1,
    " helping me rise to this challenge.": 1,
    "And when you view stress in that way, your body believes you, and your stress response becomes healthier.": 1,
    " Now, I said I have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from.": 1,
    "So we are going to do one more intervention.": 1,
    "I want to tell you about one of the most underappreciated aspects of the stress response.": 1,
    "And the idea is this.": 1,
    " Stress makes you social.": 1,
    " To understand this side of stress, we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin.": 1,
    " And I know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get.": 1,
    "It even has its own cute nickname, the cuddle hormone, because it's released when you hug someone.": 1,
    "But this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in.": 1,
    " Oxytocin is a neurohormone.": 1,
    "It fine-tunes your brain's social instincts.": 1,
    "It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships.": 1,
    " Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family.": 1,
    "It enhances your empathy.": 1,
    "It even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about.": 1,
    " Some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin.": 1,
    " to become more compassionate and caring.": 1,
    " But here's what most people don't understand about oxytocin.": 1,
    " It's a stress hormone.": 1,
    "Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response.": 1,
    "It's as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound.": 1,
    " And when oxytocin is released in the stress response, it is motivating you to seek support.": 1,
    "Your biological stress response is nudging you to tell someone how you feel instead of bottling it up.": 1,
    " Your stress response wants to make sure you notice when someone else in your life is struggling so that you can support each other.": 1,
    " When life is difficult, your stress response wants you to be surrounded by people who care about you.": 1,
    " Okay, so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier?": 1,
    "Well, oxytocin doesn't only act on your brain, it also acts on your body.": 1,
    " and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress.": 1,
    "It's a natural anti-inflammatory": 1,
    " It also helps your blood vessels stay relaxed during stress.": 1,
    "But my favorite effect on the body is actually on the heart.": 1,
    "Your heart has receptors for this hormone.": 1,
    " and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate and heal from any stress-induced damage.": 1,
    "This stress hormone strengthens your heart.": 1,
    " And the cool thing is that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced by social contact and social support.": 1,
    "So when you reach out to others under stress, either to seek support or to help someone else,": 1,
    " you release more of this hormone, your stress response becomes healthier, and you actually recover faster from stress.": 1,
    "I find this amazing that your stress response has a built-in mechanism": 1,
    " for stress resilience.": 1,
    "And that mechanism is human connection.": 1,
    " I want to finish by telling you about one more study.": 1,
    "And listen up, because this study could also save a life.": 1,
    " This study tracked about a thousand adults in the United States, and they ranged in age from 34 to 93.": 1,
    " And they started the study by asking, how much stress have you experienced in the last year?": 1,
    " They also asked, how much time have you spent helping out friends, neighbors, people in your community?": 1,
    " and then they use public records for the next five years to find out who died.": 1,
    " Okay, so the bad news first.": 1,
    "For every major stressful life experience, like financial difficulties or family crisis, that increased the risk of dying by 30%.": 1,
    " But.": 1,
    " and I hope you are expecting a but by now, but that wasn't true for everyone.": 1,
    "People who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying, zero.": 1,
    " Caring created resilience.": 1,
    " And so we see once again that the harmful effects of stress on your health are not inevitable.": 1,
    "How you think and how you act can transform your experience of stress.": 1,
    " when you choose to view your stress response as helpful.": 1,
    " you create the biology of courage.": 1,
    " And when you choose to connect with others under stress, you can create resilience.": 1,
    " Now, I wouldn't necessarily ask for more stressful experiences in my life, but this science has given me a whole new appreciation for stress.": 1,
    " Stress gives us access to our hearts.": 1,
    " the compassionate heart that finds joy and meaning in connecting with others, and yes, your pounding physical heart working so hard to give you strength and energy.": 1,
    " And when you choose to view stress in this way, you're not just getting better at stress, you're actually making a pretty profound statement.": 1,
    " you're saying that you can trust yourself to handle life's challenges.": 1,
    " And you're remembering that you don't have to face them alone.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " I mean, this is kind of amazing what you're telling us.": 1,
    "It seems amazing to me that a belief about stress can make so much difference to someone's life expectancy.": 1,
    " How would that extend to advice, like if someone is making a lifestyle choice between say a stressful job and a non-stressful job, does it matter which way they go?": 1,
    " It's equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it in some sense.": 1,
    "Yeah, and one thing we know for certain is that chasing meaning is better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort.": 1,
    "And so I would say that's really the best way to make decisions.": 1,
    " is go after what it is that creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle the stress that follows.": 1,
    "Thank you so much Kelly.": 1
