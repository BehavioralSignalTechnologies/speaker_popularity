    " Almost a year ago, my aunt started suffering back pains.": 1,
    "She went to see the doctor, and they told her that it was a normal injury for someone that had been playing tennis for almost 30 years.": 1,
    "They recommended her to do some therapy.": 1,
    " But after a while, she wasn't feeling better.": 1,
    "So the doctors decided to do further tests.": 1,
    " They had an x-ray and discovered an injury in her lungs.": 1,
    "And at the time, they thought that the injury was a strain in the muscles and tendons between her ribs.": 1,
    "But after a few weeks of treatment, again, her health was not getting any better.": 1,
    "So finally,": 1,
    " they decided to do a biopsy.": 1,
    "And two weeks later, the results of the biopsy came back.": 1,
    " It was a stage three lung cancer.": 1,
    " Her lifestyle was almost free of risk.": 1,
    "She never smoked a cigarette, she never drank alcohol, and she had been playing sports for almost half her life.": 1,
    "Perhaps that is why it took them almost six months to get her properly diagnosed.": 1,
    " My story might be, unfortunately, familiar to most of you.": 1,
    "One out of three people sitting in this audience will be diagnosed with some type of cancer.": 1,
    "And one out of four will die because of it.": 1,
    " Not only that cancer diagnosis changed the life of our family, but that process of going back and forth": 1,
    " with new tests, different doctors describing symptoms, discarding diseases, over and over, was stressful and frustrating, especially for my aunt.": 1,
    "And that is the way cancer diagnoses have been done since the beginning of history.": 1,
    " We have 21st century medical treatments and drugs to treat cancer, but we still have 20th century procedures and processes for diagnosis, if any.": 1,
    " Today, most of us have to wait for symptoms to indicate that something's wrong.": 1,
    "Today, the majority of people still don't have access to early cancer detection methods.": 1,
    " even though we know that catching cancer early is basically the closest thing we have to a silver bullet cure against it.": 1,
    " We know that we can change this in our lifetime, and that is why my team and I have decided to begin this journey.": 1,
    "This journey to try to make cancer detection at the early stages and the monitoring of drug response at the molecular level.": 1,
    " easier, cheaper, smarter, and more accessible than ever before.": 1,
    " The context, of course, is that we're living at a time where technology is disrupting our present at exponential rates.": 1,
    "And the biological realm is not an exception.": 1,
    " It is said today that biotech is advancing at least six times faster than the growth rate of the processing power of computers.": 1,
    "But progress in biotech is not only being accelerated, it is also being democratized.": 1,
    " Just as personal computers or the internet or smartphones level the playing field for entrepreneurship, politics, or education, recent advances are learning enough for biotech progress as well.": 1,
    " And that is allowing that multidisciplinary teams like ours try to tackle and look at these problems with new approaches.": 1,
    " We're a team of scientists and technologists from Chile, Panama, Mexico, Israel, and Greece.": 1,
    " And based on recent scientific discoveries, we believe that we have found a reliable and accurate way of detecting several types of cancer at the very early stages through our blood samples.": 1,
    " We do it by detecting a set of very small molecules that circulate freely in our blood called microRNAs.": 1,
    " To explain what microRNAs are and their important role in cancer, I need to start with proteins.": 1,
    "Because when cancer is present in our body, protein modification is observed in all cancer cells.": 1,
    " As you might know, proteins are large biological molecules that perform different functions within our body, like catalyzing metabolic reactions or responding to stimuli or replicating DNA.": 1,
    " But before a protein is expressed or produced, relevant parts of its genetic code present in the DNA are copied into the messenger RNA.": 1,
    " So this messenger RNA has instructions on how to build a specific protein.": 1,
    "And potentially, it can build hundreds of proteins.": 1,
    "But the one that tells them when to build them and how many to build are microRNAs.": 1,
    " So microRNAs are small molecules that regulate gene expression.": 1,
    " Unlike DNA, which is mainly fixed, microRNAs can vary depending on internal and environmental conditions at any given time.": 1,
    "They know which genes are actively expressed at that particular moment.": 1,
    "And that is what makes microRNAs such a promising biomarker for cancer.": 1,
    " Because as you know, cancer is a disease of altered gene expression.": 1,
    "It is the uncontrolled regulation of genes.": 1,
    " Another important thing to consider is that not two cancers are the same.": 1,
    " but at the microRNA level there are patterns.": 1,
    "Several scientific studies have shown that abnormal microRNA expression levels varies and creates a unique specific pattern for each type of cancer.": 1,
    " even at the early stages, reflecting the progression of the disease and whether it is responding to medication or remission, making microRNAs a perfect, highly sensitive biomarker.": 1,
    " However, the problem with microRNAs is that we cannot use existing DNA-based technology to detect them in a reliable way because they are very short sequences of nucleotides, much more smaller than DNA.": 1,
    " And also, all microRNAs are very similar to each other, with just tiny differences.": 1,
    "So imagine trying to differentiate two molecules, extremely similar, extremely small.": 1,
    " We believe that we have found a way to do so.": 1,
    "And this is the first time that we're sharing in public.": 1,
    "Let me do a demonstration.": 1,
    " Imagine that next time you go to your doctor and do your next standard blood test, a lab technician extracts a total RNA, which is quite simple today, and puts it in a standard analysis well played like this one.": 1,
    " Each well of these plates has specific biochemistry that we designed that is looking for a specific microRNA acting like a trap that closes only when the microRNA is present in the sample.": 1,
    "And when it does, it will shine with green color.": 1,
    " To run the reaction, you put the plate inside a device like this one.": 1,
    " And then you can put your smartphone on top of it.": 1,
    " If we can have a camera here so you can see my screen.": 1,
    " A smartphone is a connected computer, and it's also a camera.": 1,
    "Good enough for our purpose.": 1,
    " The smartphone is taking pictures.": 1,
    "And when the reaction is over, it will send the pictures to our online database for processing and interpretation.": 1,
    " This entire process lasts around 60 minutes.": 1,
    "But when the process is over, wells that shine are matched with a specific microRNAs and analyzed in terms of how much and how fast they shine.": 1,
    "And then, when this entire process is over,": 1,
    " This is what happens.": 1,
    "This chart is showing the specific microRNAs present in this sample and how they reacted over time.": 1,
    " then if we take this specific pattern of microRNA of this person's samples and compare it with existing scientific documentation that correlates microRNA patterns with the specific presence of a disease,": 1,
    " This is how pancreatic cancer looks like.": 1,
    " This inside is a real sample for we just detected pancreatic cancer.": 1,
    " Another important aspect of this approach is the gathering and mining of data in the cloud.": 1,
    "So we can get results in real time and analyze them with our contextual information.": 1,
    " If we want to better understand and decode diseases like cancer, we need to stop treating them as acute, isolated episodes and consider everything and measure that affects our health on a permanent basis.": 1,
    " This entire platform is a working prototype.": 1,
    "It uses state-of-the-art molecular biology, a low-cost 3D printed device, and data science to try to tackle one of humanity's toughest challenges.": 1,
    " Since we believe early cancer detection should really be democratized, this entire solution costs at least 50 times less than current available methods.": 1,
    "And we know that the community can help us accelerate this even more.": 1,
    "So we're making the design of the device open source.": 1,
    " Let me say very clearly that we are at the very early stages.": 1,
    "But so far, we have been able to successfully identify the microRNA pattern of pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and hepatic cancer.": 1,
    " And currently, we're doing a clinical trial in collaboration with the German Cancer Research Center with 200 women for breast cancer.": 1,
    " But.": 1,
    " This is a single, non-invasive, accurate and affordable test that has the potential to dramatically change how cancer procedures and diagnostics have been done.": 1,
    " Since we're looking for the microRNA patterns in your blood at any given time, you don't need to know which cancer you're looking for.": 1,
    "You don't need to have any symptoms.": 1,
    "You only need one milliliter of blood and a relatively simple array of tools.": 1,
    " Today, cancer detection happens mainly when symptoms appear.": 1,
    "That is stage three or four.": 1,
    "And I believe that is too late.": 1,
    "It is too expensive for our families.": 1,
    "It is too expensive for humanity.": 1,
    " We cannot lose the war against cancer.": 1,
    "It not only cost us billions of dollars, but it also cost us the people we love.": 1,
    " Today, my aunt, she's fighting bravely and going through this process with a very positive attitude.": 1,
    "However, I won't fight like this to become very rare.": 1,
    " I want to see the day when cancer is treated easily because it can be routinely diagnosed at the very early stages.": 1,
    "And I'm certain": 1,
    " that in the very near future, because of this and all the other breakthroughs that we're seeing every day in life sciences, the way we see cancer will radically change.": 1,
    " It will give us a chance of detecting it early, understanding it better, and finding a cure.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
