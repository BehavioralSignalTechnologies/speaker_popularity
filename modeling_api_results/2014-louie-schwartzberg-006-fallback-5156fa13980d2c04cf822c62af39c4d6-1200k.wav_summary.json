    " What is the intersection between technology, art, and science?": 1,
    " curiosity and wonder, because it drives us to explore, because we're surrounded by things we can't see.": 1,
    "And I love to use film to take us on a journey through portals of time and space.": 1,
    " to make the invisible visible.": 1,
    "Because what that does, it expands our horizons, it transforms our perception, it opens our minds, and it touches our heart.": 1,
    " So here are some scenes from my 3Dimax film, Mysteries of the Unseen World.": 1,
    " There is movement which is too slow for our eyes to detect.": 1,
    "And time lapse makes us discover and broaden our perspective of life.": 1,
    "We can see how organisms emerge and grow.": 1,
    " How a vine survives by creeping from the forest floor to look at the sunlight.": 1,
    " And on a grand scale, time lapse allows us to see our planet in motion.": 1,
    " We can view not only the vast sweep of nature, but the restless movement of humanity.": 1,
    " Each streaking dot represents a passenger plane, and by turning air traffic data into time-lapse imagery, we can see something that's above us constantly but invisible.": 1,
    "It's a vast network of air travel over the United States.": 1,
    " We can do the same thing with ships at sea.": 1,
    "We can turn data into a time-lapse view of a global economy in motion.": 1,
    " you": 1,
    " and decades of data give us a view of our entire planet as a single organism, sustained by currents circulating throughout the oceans and by clouds swirling through the atmosphere.": 1,
    " pulsing with lightning, crowned by the Aurora Borealis.": 1,
    " It may be the ultimate time lapse image.": 1,
    " the anatomy of Earth brought to life.": 1,
    " At the other extreme, there are things that move too fast for our eyes.": 1,
    " But we have technology that can look into that world as well.": 1,
    " With high speed cameras, we can do the opposite of time lapse.": 1,
    "We can shoot images that are thousands of times faster than our vision.": 1,
    " And we can see how nature's ingenious devices work.": 1,
    "And perhaps we can even imitate them.": 1,
    " When a dragonfly flutters by, you may not realize, but it's the greatest flyer in nature.": 1,
    "It can hover, fly backwards,": 1,
    " even upside down.": 1,
    " And by tracking markers on an insect's wings, we can visualize the airflow that they produce.": 1,
    " Nobody knew the secret, but high speed shows that a dragonfly can move all four wings in different directions at the same time.": 1,
    " And what we've learned can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers that can expand our vision of important and remote places.": 1,
    " We're giants, and we're unaware of things that are too small for us to see.": 1,
    "The electron microscope fires electrons, which creates images which can magnify things by as much as a million times.": 1,
    "This is the egg of a butterfly.": 1,
    " And there are unseen creatures living all over your body, including mites that spend their entire lives dwelling on your eyelashes, crawling over your skin at night.": 1,
    " Can you guess what this is?": 1,
    " Sharkskin.": 1,
    " The caterpillar's mouth.": 1,
    " the eye of a fruit fly.": 1,
    " an eggshell.": 1,
    " A flea.": 1,
    " A snail's tongue.": 1,
    " We think we do most of the animal kingdom, but there may be millions of tiny species waiting to be discovered.": 1,
    " A spider also has great secrets, because spider silk thread is pound for pound stronger than steel, but completely elastic.": 1,
    "This journey will take us all the way down to the nano world.": 1,
    " The silk is a hundred times thinner than human hair.": 1,
    " on their bacteria.": 1,
    " and near that bacteria 10 times smaller, a virus.": 1,
    " Inside of that, ten times smaller, three strands of DNA.": 1,
    " and nearing the limit of our most powerful microscopes, single carbon atoms.": 1,
    " With the tip of a powerful microscope, we can actually move atoms and begin to create amazing nano devices.": 1,
    " Some could one day patrol our body for all kinds of diseases and clean out clogged arteries along the way.": 1,
    " tiny chemical machines of the future can one day perhaps repair DNA.": 1,
    " We are on the threshold of extraordinary advances, born of our drive to unveil the mysteries of life.": 1,
    " So under an endless rain of cosmic dust, the air is full of pollen, microdiamonds and jewels from other planets, and supernova explosions.": 1,
    " People go about their lives surrounded by the unseeable.": 1,
    " knowing that there's so much around us we can see forever changes our understanding of the world.": 1,
    "And by looking at unseen worlds, we recognize that we exist in the living universe.": 1,
    " And this new perspective creates wonder and inspires us to become explorers in our own backyards.": 1,
    " Who knows what waits to be seen and what new wonders will transform our lives.": 1,
    " We'll just have to see.": 1
