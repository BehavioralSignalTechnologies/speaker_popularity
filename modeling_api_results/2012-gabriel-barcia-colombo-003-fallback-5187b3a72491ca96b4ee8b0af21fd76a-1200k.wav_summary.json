    " I love to collect things.": 1,
    "Ever since I was a kid, I've had massive collections of random stuff.": 1,
    "Everything from bizarre hot sauces from all around the world to insects that I've captured and put in jars.": 1,
    " Now, it's no secret because I like collecting things that I love the Natural History Museum and the collections of animals at the Natural History Museum in dioramas.": 1,
    "These to me are like living sculptures, right, that you can go and look at, and they memorialize a specific point of time in this animal's life.": 1,
    " So I was thinking about my own life and how I'd like to memorialize my life, you know, for the ages, and also the lives of my friends.": 1,
    "But the problem with this is that my friends aren't quite keen on the idea of me taxidermying them.": 1,
    " So instead, I turned to video, and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize someone and to capture a specific moment in time.": 1,
    "So what I did was I filmed six of my friends, and then, using video mapping and video projection, I created a video sculpture, which was these six friends": 1,
    " projected into jars.": 1,
    " So now I have this collection of my friends I can take around with me wherever I go.": 1,
    "And this is called Anamalia Cordata from the Latin nomenclature for a human being classification system.": 1,
    "So this piece memorializes my friends in these jars.": 1,
    " and they actually move around.": 1,
    " So this is interesting to me, but it lacked a certain human element.": 1,
    " It's a digital sculpture.": 1,
    "So I wanted to add an interaction system.": 1,
    "So what I did was I added a proximity sensor so that when you get close to the people in jars, they react to you in different ways.": 1,
    "You know, just like people on the street when you get too close to them.": 1,
    "Some people reacted in terror.": 1,
    " Others react and ask you for help.": 1,
    " and some people hide from you.": 1,
    " So this is really interesting to me, this idea of taking video off the screen and putting it in real life, and also adding interactivity to sculpture.": 1,
    " So over the next year, I documented 40 of my other friends and trapped them in jars as well and created a piece known as garden, which is literally a garden of humanity.": 1,
    " But something about the first piece, the Anamalia Cordata piece, kept coming back to me.": 1,
    "This idea of interaction with art.": 1,
    "And I really like the idea of people being able to interact and also being challenged by interacting with art.": 1,
    " So I wanted to create a new piece that actually forced people to come and interact with something.": 1,
    "The way I did this was actually by projecting a 1950s housewife into a blender.": 1,
    " This is a piece called Blend.": 1,
    "And what it does is it actually makes you implicit in the work of art.": 1,
    "You may never experience the entire thing yourself.": 1,
    "You can walk away, you can just watch as this character stands there in the blender and looks at you.": 1,
    "Or you can actually choose to interact with it.": 1,
    " So if you do choose to interact with the piece.": 1,
    " and you press the Blender button, it actually sends this character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment.": 1,
    " By doing that, you are now part of my piece.": 1,
    "You like the people that are trapped in my work.": 1,
    " have become part of my work as well.": 1,
    " But, but...": 1,
    " This seems a bit unfair, right?": 1,
    "I put my friends in jars.": 1,
    "I put this character, this sort of endangered species character in a blender.": 1,
    "But I've never done anything about myself.": 1,
    "I've never really memorialized myself.": 1,
    "So I decided to create a piece, which was a self-portrait piece.": 1,
    " This is sort of a self-portrait taxidermy time capsule piece called A Point Just Passed, in which I project myself on top of a time card punch clock.": 1,
    "And it's up to you.": 1,
    "If you want to choose to punch that punch card clock, you actually age me.": 1,
    "So I start as a baby.": 1,
    " And then if you punch the clock, you'll actually transform the baby into a toddler.": 1,
    "And then from a toddler, I'm transformed into a teenager.": 1,
    "From a teenager, I'm transformed into my current self.": 1,
    "From my current self, I'm turned into a middle-aged man.": 1,
    " and then from there into an elderly man.": 1,
    " And if you punch the punch card clock 100 times in one day,": 1,
    " The piece goes black and is not to be reset until the next day.": 1,
    "So in doing so, you're erasing time.": 1,
    " You're actually implicit in this work, and you're erasing my life.": 1,
    "So I like this about interactive video sculpture, that you can actually interact with it, that all of you can actually touch an artwork and be part of the artwork yourselves.": 1,
    "And hopefully one day, I'll have each and every one of you trapped in one of my jars.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
