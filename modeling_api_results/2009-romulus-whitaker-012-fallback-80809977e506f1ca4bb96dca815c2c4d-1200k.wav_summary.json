    " I want you to put off your preconceptions, your preconceived fears and thoughts about reptiles, because that's the only way I'm going to get my story across to you.": 1,
    " And by the way, if I come across as a sort of rabid hippie conservationist, it's purely a figment of your imagination.": 1,
    " Okay, we are actually the first species on earth to be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival.": 1,
    " And I know we've all seen images enough to make us numb of the tragedies that were perpetuating on the planet.": 1,
    "We're kind of like greedy kids using it all up, aren't we?": 1,
    " And today is a time for me to talk to you about water.": 1,
    "It's not only because we like to drink lots of it, and its marvelous derivatives, beer, wine, etc.": 1,
    " And of course, watch it fall from the sky and flow in our wonderful rivers.": 1,
    " but for several other reasons as well.": 1,
    "When I was a kid growing up in New York, I was smitten by snakes the same way most kids are smitten by tops, marbles, cars, trains, cricket balls, and my mother.": 1,
    " brave lady was partly to blame, taking me to the New York Natural History Museum, buying me books on snakes, and then starting this infamous career of mine, which...": 1,
    " has culminated in, of course, arriving in India 60 years ago, brought by my mother Doris Norden and my stepfather Ram Chettupadhyay.": 1,
    "It's been a roller coaster ride.": 1,
    " Two animals, two iconic reptiles, really captivated me very early on.": 1,
    "One of them was this remarkable ghariel, this crocodile which grows to almost 20 feet long in the northern rivers.": 1,
    " and this charismatic snake, the King Cobra.": 1,
    "What my purpose of the talk today really is to sort of indelibly scar your minds with these charismatic and majestic creatures because": 1,
    " This is what you will take away from here, a reconnection with nature, I hope.": 1,
    " The King Cobra is quite remarkable for several reasons.": 1,
    "What you're seeing here is very recently shot images in a forest nearby here.": 1,
    " of a female king cobra making her nest.": 1,
    "Here's a limbless animal capable of gathering a huge mound of leaves and then laying her eggs inside to withstand five to ten meters of rain.": 1,
    " in order that the eggs can incubate over the next 90 days and hatch into little baby king cobras.": 1,
    "So she protects her eggs, and after three months,": 1,
    " the babies finally do hatch out.": 1,
    "The majority of them will die, of course.": 1,
    "There's very high mortality in little baby reptiles who are just 10, 12 inches long.": 1,
    " My first experience with King Cobras was in 72 at a magical place called Agumbe in Karnataka, this state.": 1,
    "And it is a marvelous rainforest.": 1,
    "And this first encounter was kind of like the": 1,
    " the Maasai boy who kills the lion to become a warrior.": 1,
    "It really changed my life totally and it brought me straight into the conservation fray.": 1,
    " And I ended up starting this research and education station in Agumbe, which you're all of course invited to visit.": 1,
    " This is basically a base wherein we're trying to gather and learn virtually everything about the biodiversity of this incredibly complex forest system.": 1,
    " and try to hang on to what's there, make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean.": 1,
    "And of course, having a good time too.": 1,
    "You can almost hear the drums, you know, of the throbbing back in that little...": 1,
    " cottage where we stay when we're there.": 1,
    "It was very important for us to get through to the people and through the children is usually the way to go.": 1,
    "They're fascinated with snakes.": 1,
    "They haven't got that": 1,
    " You know, that steely thing that you end up either fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way.": 1,
    "They're interested and it really works to start with them.": 1,
    " This gives you an idea of the size of some of these snakes.": 1,
    "This was an average-sized king cobra, about 12 feet long.": 1,
    "And it actually crawled into somebody's bathroom and was hanging around there for two or three days.": 1,
    "The people of this part of India worshiped the king cobra.": 1,
    " and they didn't kill it, they called us to catch it and we've caught more than a hundred King Corbus over the last three years and relocated them in nearby forests.": 1,
    " But in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures was for us to actually insert a small radio transmitter inside the snake and we were able to follow them and find out their secrets.": 1,
    " where the babies go after they hatch.": 1,
    "And remarkable things like this you're about to see.": 1,
    "This was just a few days ago in Agumbe.": 1,
    "I had the pleasure of": 1,
    " being close to this large king cobra who had caught a venomous pit viper and it does it in such a way that it doesn't get bitten itself.": 1,
    " And King Corpus feed only on snakes.": 1,
    "And this was kind of a tidbit for it, what we'd say a vare or a idli or something like that.": 1,
    " usually they eat something a bit larger.": 1,
    "In this case, a rather strange and inexplicable activity happened over the last breeding season, wherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra": 1,
    " didn't mate with it, actually killed it and swallowed it.": 1,
    "We're still trying to explain and come to terms with what is the evolutionary advantage of this.": 1,
    " But they do also a lot of other remarkable things.": 1,
    "This is again something that by virtue of the fact that we had a radio transmitter in one of the snakes, this male snake, 12 feet long, met another male king cobra, and they did this incredible ritual combat dance.": 1,
    " It's very much like the rutting of mammals, including humans, sorting out our differences, but gentler, no biting allowed.": 1,
    "It's just a wrestling match, but a remarkable activity.": 1,
    " Now, what are we doing with all this information?": 1,
    "What's the point of all this?": 1,
    "Well, the king cobra is literally a keystone species in these rainforests.": 1,
    " And our job is to convince the authorities that these forests have to be protected.": 1,
    "And this is one of the ways we do it, by learning as much as we can about something so remarkable and so iconic.": 1,
    " in the rainforest there in order to help protect trees, animals, and of course the water sources.": 1,
    "You've all heard perhaps of Project Tiger, which started back in the early 70s.": 1,
    " which was in fact a very dynamic time for conservation.": 1,
    "We were piloted, I could say, by a highly autocratic stateswoman, but who also had an incredible passion for environment.": 1,
    " And this is the time when Project Tiger emerged.": 1,
    "And just like Project Tiger, our": 1,
    " activities with the king cobra is to look at a species of animal that we protect its habitat and everything within it.": 1,
    "So the tiger is the icon and now a king cobra is a new one.": 1,
    " All the major rivers in South India are sourced in the Western Ghats, the chain of hills running along the west coast of India.": 1,
    " it pours out millions of gallons every hour and supplies drinking water to at least three hundred million people.": 1,
    " washes many, many babies and, of course, feeds many, many animals, both domestic and wild, produces thousands of tons of rice.": 1,
    " And what do we do?": 1,
    "How do we respond to this?": 1,
    "Well, basically, we dam it.": 1,
    "We pollute it.": 1,
    "We pour in pesticides, weedicides, fungicides.": 1,
    "You drink it.": 1,
    " in peril of your life.": 1,
    "And the thing is, it's not just big industry.": 1,
    "It's not misguided river engineers who are doing all this.": 1,
    "It's us.": 1,
    "It seems that our citizens find the best way to dispose of garbage are in water sources.": 1,
    " Okay, now going north, very far north, north central India, the Chambal River is where we have our base, and this is the home of the gharial, this incredible crocodilian.": 1,
    " It is an animal which has been on the earth for just about 100 million years.": 1,
    "It survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off.": 1,
    " It has remarkable features, even though it grows to 20 feet long.": 1,
    "Since it eats only fish, it's not dangerous to human beings.": 1,
    "It does have big teeth, however, and you know, it's kind of hard to convince people when an animal has big teeth that it's a harmless creature.": 1,
    " But we actually, back in the early 70s, did surveys and found that GARRIEL were": 1,
    " extremely rare, and in fact, if you see the map, the range of their original habitat was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan to the Irrawaddy in Burma, and now it's just limited to a couple of spots in Nepal and India.": 1,
    " In fact, at this point, there's only 200 breeding area left in the wild.": 1,
    " Starting in the mid-70s when, you know, conservation was at the fore, we were actually able to start projects which were basically government-supported to collect eggs from the wild from the few remaining nests and release 5,000 baby garyl back to the wild.": 1,
    " And pretty soon we were seeing sites like this.": 1,
    "I mean, it's just incredible to see bunches of gharial basking on the river again.": 1,
    "But complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt.": 1,
    " And sure enough, with all the other pressures on the river, like sand mining, for example, very, very heavy cultivation all the way down to the riverside, not allowing the animals to breed anymore.": 1,
    " We were looking at even more problems building up for the Gario, despite the early good intentions.": 1,
    " There are nests hatching along the riverside, producing hundreds of hatchlings.": 1,
    "It's just an amazing sight.": 1,
    "And this was actually just taken last year.": 1,
    " But then the monsoon arrives, and unfortunately, downriver there's always a dam, there's always a barrage, and they get washed down to their doom.": 1,
    " Luckily, there is still a lot of interest.": 1,
    "My pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN, the Madras Snake Park and NGO, the World Wildlife Fund, the Wildlife Institute of India, State Forest Departments, and the Ministry of Environment, we all work together on stuff.": 1,
    " But it's possibly and definitely not enough.": 1,
    "So for example, in the winter of 2007 and 2008, there was this incredible die-off of gharial in the Chambal River.": 1,
    "Suddenly, dozens of gharial": 1,
    " appearing on the river dead.": 1,
    "Why?": 1,
    "How could it happen?": 1,
    "This is a relatively clean river.": 1,
    "The Chambal, if you look at it, clear water.": 1,
    "People scoop water out of the Chambal and drink it.": 1,
    "Something you wouldn't do in most North Indian rivers.": 1,
    " So in order to try to find out the answer to this, we got veterinarians from all over the world working with Indian vets to try to figure out what was happening.": 1,
    "I was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside and we actually looked through": 1,
    " all their organs and try to figure out what was going on and it came down to something called gout which as a result of kidney breakdown is actually uric acid crystals throughout the body and": 1,
    " worse in the joints, which made the garyo unable to swim and it's a horribly painful death.": 1,
    " Just down river from the Chambal is the filthy Yamuna River, the sacred Yamuna River.": 1,
    "I hate to be so ironic and": 1,
    " sarcastic about it, but it's the truth.": 1,
    "It's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine.": 1,
    "It flows down through Delhi, Mathura, Agra and gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine.": 1,
    " So it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial was something in the food chain, something in the fish they were eating.": 1,
    "And once the toxin is in the food chain, everything is affected, including us.": 1,
    " because these rivers are the lifeblood of people all along their course.": 1,
    "In order to try to answer some of these questions, we again turn to technology, to biological technology, in this case again telemetry,": 1,
    " putting radios on Tengariel and actually following their movements.": 1,
    "They're being watched every day as we speak to try to find out what this mysterious toxin is.": 1,
    " The Chambal River is an absolutely incredible place.": 1,
    "It's a place that's famous to a lot of you who know about the bandits, the dacoits who used to": 1,
    " work up there, and there still are quite a few around, but Phoolan Devi was one, which actually Sheikh Kapoor made an incredible movie, The Bandit Queen, which I urge you to see.": 1,
    "You get to see the incredible landscape as well.": 1,
    " But again, heavy fishing pressures.": 1,
    "This is one of the last repositories of the Ganges River dolphin, various species of turtles, thousands of migratory birds.": 1,
    " and fishing causing problems like this, and then now the whole sort of new elements of human intolerance for river creatures like the gharial means that instead of": 1,
    " If they don't drown in the net, then they simply cut their beaks off.": 1,
    "Animals like the Ganges River dolphin, which is just down to a few left and is also critically endangered.": 1,
    "So who's next?": 1,
    "Us?": 1,
    " because we are all dependent on these water sources.": 1,
    "So we all know about the Narmada River, the tragedies of dams, the tragedies of huge projects which displace people and wreck river systems without providing livelihoods,": 1,
    " and development just basically going berserk for a double figure growth index basically.": 1,
    "So we're not sure where this story is going to end, whether it's got a happy or sad ending, and climate change is certainly going to": 1,
    " turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads.": 1,
    " We're still working hard at it.": 1,
    "We've got a good team of people working up there.": 1,
    "And the thing is, the decision makers, the folks in power, they're up in their bungalows and so on in Delhi and the city capitals.": 1,
    "They're all supplied with plenty of water.": 1,
    "It's cool.": 1,
    " But out on the rivers there's still millions of people who are in really bad shape and it's a bleak future for them.": 1,
    " So we have our Ganges and Yamuna cleanup project.": 1,
    "We've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it and nothing to show for it.": 1,
    "Incredible.": 1,
    " So people talk about political will during the die-off of the guerrilla.": 1,
    "We did galvanize a lot of action.": 1,
    "Government cut through all the red tape and we got foreign vets over.": 1,
    "It was great.": 1,
    "So we can do it.": 1,
    " But if you stroll down to the Yamuna, or to the Gomti in Lucknow, or to the Adiyar River in Chennai, or the Mulamutta River in Pune, just see what we're capable of doing to a river.": 1,
    "It's sad.": 1,
    " But I think the final note really is that": 1,
    " We can do it.": 1,
    "The corporates, the artists, the wildlife nuts, the good old everyday folks can actually bring these rivers back.": 1,
    " And the final word is that there's a king cobra looking over our shoulders.": 1,
    "And there's a gharial looking at us from the river.": 1,
    " And these are powerful water totems.": 1,
    "And they're going to disturb our dreams until we do the right thing.": 1,
    "Namaskar.": 1,
    " Thanks, Ron.": 1,
    " Thanks a lot.": 1,
    "You know, most people are terrified of snakes, and there might be quite a few people here who would be very glad to see the last king cobra bite the dust.": 1,
    "I mean, do you have those conversations with people?": 1,
    "How do you really get them to care?": 1,
    " I take the sort of humble approach, I guess you could say.": 1,
    "I don't say that snakes are huggable exactly.": 1,
    "It's not like the teddy bear.": 1,
    "But I sort of...": 1,
    " There's an innocence in these animals and when the average person looks at a cobra going like that they say my god look at that angry dangerous creature I look at it.": 1,
    " as a creature who is totally frightened of something so dangerous as a human being.": 1,
    "And that is the truth.": 1,
    "And that's what I try to get across.": 1,
    " That incredible footage you showed of the pit viper being killed, you're saying that hasn't been filmed before?": 1,
    " Yeah, this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it, for one thing.": 1,
    "As I said, it's just like a little snack for him, you know.": 1,
    "Usually they eat larger snakes like rat snakes or even cobras.": 1,
    "But this guy who we're following right now is in the deep jungle.": 1,
    " And whereas other king cobras very often come into the human interface, you know, the plantations to find big rat snakes and stuff, this guy specializes in pit vipers.": 1,
    "And the guy who's working there with me now is from Maharashtra.": 1,
    " He said, I think he's after the Nasha.": 1,
    " Now the Nasher means the high.": 1,
    "Whenever he eats a pit viper, he gets this little venom rush.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
