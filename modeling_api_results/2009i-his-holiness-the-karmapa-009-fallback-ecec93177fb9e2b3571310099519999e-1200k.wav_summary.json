    " That's all.": 14,
    "Thank you.": 4,
    " So, thank you very much.": 3,
    " Thank you.": 2,
    " Yes, sir.": 2,
    " That's it.": 2,
    "Yes.": 2,
    " And then, that's why I said that,": 1,
    " The way I feel right now is that all of the other speakers have said exactly what I wanted to say.": 1,
    " And it seems that the only thing left for me to say is to thank you all for your kindness.": 1,
    " But maybe in the spirit of appreciating the kindness of you all, I could share with you a little story about myself.": 1,
    " I would like to say a few words on behalf of the people of Lengue.": 1,
    " Ah.": 1,
    " Pajji, I am willing to give up my life for you.": 1,
    "I am willing to give up everything for you.": 1,
    " And then they say, I don't know.": 1,
    "I don't know.": 1,
    " From the time I was very young onward, I was given a lot of different responsibilities.": 1,
    "And it always seemed to me when I was young that everything was laid out before me.": 1,
    "All of the plans for me were already made.": 1,
    " I was given the clothes that I needed to wear and told where I needed to be, given these very precious and holy-looking robes to wear with the understanding that it was something sacred or important.": 1,
    " I don't understand this world": 1,
    " And the searching group.": 1,
    " Isn't it?": 1,
    " And then you do.": 1,
    " I don't know if it's true or not, but I think it's true.": 1,
    "I don't know if it's true or not, but I think it's true.": 1,
    "I think it's true.": 1,
    " But before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me, I was living in eastern Tibet with my family, and when I was seven years old, all of a sudden, a search party arrived at my home.": 1,
    " they were looking for the next Karmapa and I noticed they were talking to my mom and dad and the news came to me that they were telling me that I was the Karmapa.": 1,
    " And these days, people ask me a lot, how did that feel?": 1,
    "How did that feel when they came and whisked you away and your lifestyle completely changed?": 1,
    " And what I mostly say is that at that time it was a pretty interesting idea to me.": 1,
    "I thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with.": 1,
    " I mean,": 1,
    " And in ASEAN, traditional kashmata, luksu, sugyun kata, luksu, thangpo gye yi de be, gombya, nanglo, tig suyi, tig nanglo, ya de che.": 1,
    " Some of the...": 1,
    " But it didn't turn out to be so fun and entertaining as I thought it would have been.": 1,
    "I was placed in a pretty strictly controlled environment.": 1,
    " immediately a lot of different responsibilities in terms of my education and so forth were heaped upon me.": 1,
    " I was separated largely from my family, including my mother and father.": 1,
    "I didn't have many personal friends to spend time with, but I was expected to perform these prescribed duties.": 1,
    " So it turned out that my fantasy about an entertaining life of being the Karmapa wasn't going to come true.": 1,
    "It more felt to be the case to me that I was being treated like a statue and I was to sit in one place": 1,
    " like a statue would.": 1,
    " Okay, thank you.": 1,
    " Khyent.": 1,
    " Even...": 1,
    " That's all the play with the summer.": 1,
    "Okay": 1,
    " Nevertheless, I felt that even though I've been separated from my loved ones, and of course now I'm even further away, when I was 14 I escaped from Tibet and became even": 1,
    " further removed from my mother and father, my relatives, my friends and my homeland, but": 1,
    " Nevertheless, there's no real sense of separation from me and my heart in terms of the love that I feel for these people.": 1,
    " I feel still a very strong connection of love for all of these people and for the land.": 1,
    " I would like to thank all of you for being here today.": 1,
    " This is the end of the presentation.": 1,
    " And I still do get to keep in touch with my mother and father, albeit infrequently.": 1,
    "I talk to my mother once in a blue moon on the telephone.": 1,
    " And my experience is that when I'm talking to her, with every second that passes during our conversation, the feeling of love that binds us is bringing us closer and closer together.": 1,
    " That's the end of the video.": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1,
    " And then we will get started with that.": 1,
    " And then": 1,
    " So, we need to be very careful.": 1,
    " So those were just a few remarks about my personal background and in terms of other things that I wanted to share with you in terms of ideas.": 1,
    " I think it's wonderful to have a situation like this where so many people from different backgrounds and places can come together, exchange their ideas, and form relationships of friendship with each other.": 1,
    " And I think that's symbolic of what we're seeing in the world in general, that the world is becoming smaller and smaller, and that all of the peoples in the world are enjoying more opportunities for connection.": 1,
    " That's wonderful, but we should also remember that we should have a similar process happening on the inside, along with outward development and increase of opportunity.": 1,
    " There should be inward development and deepening of our heart connections as well as our outward connections.": 1,
    " So, we spoke and we heard some about design this week.": 1,
    "I think that it's important for us to remember that we need to keep pushing forward on the endeavor of the design of the heart.": 1,
    " We heard a lot about technology this week and it's important for us to remember to invest a lot of our energy in improving the technology of the heart.": 1,
    " This is the most important part of my life.": 1,
    "I don't know how many years I will live.": 1,
    " So even though I'm somewhat happy about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world, still I feel a sense of impediment when it comes to": 1,
    " the ability that we have to connect with each other on a heart to heart or a mind to mind level.": 1,
    "I feel that there are some things that are getting in the way.": 1,
    " Intelligent.": 1,
    " Afghanistan.": 1,
    "That's all.": 1,
    " My relationship to this concept of heart to heart connection or mind to mind connection is an interesting one because as a spiritual leader I'm always attempting to open my heart to others and": 1,
    " offer myself up for heart to heart and mind to mind connections in a genuine way with other people.": 1,
    "But at the same time, I've always been advised that I need to emphasize intelligence over the heart to heart connections because": 1,
    " being someone in a position like mine, if I don't rely primarily on intelligence, then something dangerous may happen to me.": 1,
    "So it's an interesting paradox at play there, but...": 1,
    " I had": 1,
    " a really striking experience once when a group from Afghanistan came to visit me and we had a really interesting conversation.": 1,
    " Mm.": 1,
    " So that's it.": 1,
    "I'll see you next time.": 1,
    " Yes.": 1,
    " And then, uh, the, the,": 1,
    " But because of this, we have to be very careful with our phone calls.": 1,
    " So, the German language, the German language, the German language, the German language,": 1,
    " Lama Pinsu, on the other hand, chik chik chik, self-tonga chik liya.": 1,
    "That dee, buddhan dee chang dee chen dee, dee dao dee deen deen, self-tonga chik.": 1,
    " So we ended up talking about the Bamiyan Buddhas, which as you know were destroyed some years ago in Afghanistan.": 1,
    " But the basis of our conversation was a different approach to spirituality on the part of the Muslim and Buddhist traditions.": 1,
    " Of course, in Muslim, because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry, you don't find as many physical representations of divinity.": 1,
    " or of spiritual liberation as you do in the Buddhist tradition where of course there are many statues of the Buddha that are highly revered.": 1,
    " So we were talking about the differences between the traditions and what many people perceived as the tragedy of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas, but I offered the suggestion that perhaps we could look at this in a positive way.": 1,
    " What we saw in the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was some": 1,
    " the depletion of matter, some solid substance falling down and disintegrating, maybe we could look at that to be more similar to the falling of the Berlin Wall.": 1,
    " where a divide that had kept two types of people apart had collapsed and opened up a door for further communication.": 1,
    " So I think that in this way, it's always possible for us to derive something positive that can help us understand one another better.": 1,
    " Hmm, did they induce that now?": 1,
    " I know.": 1,
    " I think it is very important for us to have a good relationship with each other.": 1,
    "I think it is very important.": 1,
    " That's right.": 1,
    " So with regard to the development that we've been talking about here at this conference, I really feel that": 1,
    " The development that we make shouldn't create a further burden for us as human beings, but should be used to": 1,
    " improve our fundamental lifestyle of how we live in the world.": 1,
    " So, I think that's a very good question.": 1,
    " natural resources.": 1,
    " Motivation.": 1,
    " Because if you don't have a mind, you don't know what you're doing.": 1,
    "You don't know what to do.": 1,
    " So, so,": 1,
    " So that's the main reason why I'm here today.": 1,
    " Of course I rejoice in the development and the growth and the rise of the noble land of India, the great country of India.": 1,
    " But at the same time, I think, as some of us have acknowledged, we need to be aware that some aspects of this rise are": 1,
    " coming at the cost of the very ground on which we stand.": 1,
    " So as we are climbing the tree, some of the things that we're doing in order to climb the tree are actually undermining the tree's very root.": 1,
    " What I think it comes down to is a question of not only having information of what's going on, but paying attention to that.": 1,
    " and letting that shift our motivation to become more sincere and genuinely positive.": 1,
    " We have heard this week about the horrible sufferings, for example, that so many women of the world are enduring day to day.": 1,
    " We have that information, but what often happens to us is that we don't really choose to pay attention to it.": 1,
    "We don't really choose to allow that to cause there to be a shift in our heart.": 1,
    " So I think the way forward for the world, one that will bring the path of outer development in harmony with": 1,
    " the real root of happiness is that we allow the information that we have to really make a change in our heart.": 1,
    " Today, you knew Santa.": 1,
    " as happiness digs out.": 1,
    " That's why I said that if you want to be a good teacher, you have to be a good teacher.": 1,
    "If you want to be a good teacher, you have to be a good teacher.": 1,
    " So, I would like to say thank you very much.": 1,
    " So I think this sincere motivation is very important for our future well-being, our deep sense of well-being as humans.": 1,
    " And I think that means sinking in to whatever it is you're doing now.": 1,
    "Whatever work you're trying to do now to benefit the world, sink into that.": 1,
    "Get a full taste of that.": 1,
    " Today, we are here at the Nyingma Kasyarini, at the Debted Conference, where we are going to talk about the Tantrayama Rinpoche.": 1,
    " Other guys are not paying attention.": 1,
    "Impressive.": 1,
    " That's why I think it's important for us to learn from each other.": 1,
    " So since we've been here this week, we've taken millions of breaths collectively and perhaps": 1,
    " we haven't witnessed any course changes happening in our lives.": 1,
    "We often miss the very subtle changes, and I think that sometimes we": 1,
    " develop grand concepts of what happiness might look like for us, but that if we pay attention, we can see that there are little symbols of happiness in every breath that we take.": 1,
    " Thank you so much.": 1,
    " And that's it.": 1,
    " Then you have to be done.": 1,
    "I told you, you have to be done.": 1,
    " That's what I'm trying to say.": 1,
    " So I would like to thank all of you.": 1,
    " So every one of you who has come here is so talented and you have so much to offer to the world.": 1,
    " I think it would be a good note to conclude on then, to just take a moment to appreciate how fortunate we are to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas and really form a strong aspiration.": 1,
    " and energy within ourselves that we will take the good that has come from this conference, the momentum, the positivity, and we will spread that and plant it in all of the corners of the world.": 1,
    " I'm here.": 1,
    "That's me.": 1,
    "That's it.": 1,
    " Tomorrow is mine.": 1,
    " Talk.": 1,
    "Just like that.": 1,
    " Lakshmi has worked incredibly hard, even in inviting me, let alone everything else that she has done to make this happen.": 1,
    " And I was somewhat resistant at times, and I was also very nervous throughout this week.": 1,
    "I was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth, and people would ask me why.": 1,
    "I would tell them it's because I have to talk tomorrow.": 1,
    " And so Lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that, but I very much appreciate the opportunity she's given me to be here.": 1,
    " That's how I want to do it.": 1,
    "To you, everyone.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
