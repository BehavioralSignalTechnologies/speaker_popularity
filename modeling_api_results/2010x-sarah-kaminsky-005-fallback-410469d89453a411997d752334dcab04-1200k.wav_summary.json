    " Je suis la fille d'un faussaire.": 1,
    " Not just any fake.": 1,
    "When we hear fake, we often understand mercenaries, fake coins, fake paintings.": 1,
    "My father is not one of those people.": 1,
    " For 30 years of his life, he has made fake papers.": 1,
    "Never for himself, always for others, and to help the persecuted and oppressed.": 1,
    " Let me introduce you.": 1,
    "This is my father when he was 19 years old.": 1,
    " During World War II, when he was 17 years old, he found himself propelled into a fake paper laboratory.": 1,
    "He quickly became the expert in fake papers of the Resistance.": 1,
    " And here, the story is not trivial, it is that after liberation, he continued to make fake papers until the 70s.": 1,
    "When I was little, I didn't know anything about all this, of course.": 1,
    "It's me in the middle who is crying.": 1,
    " I grew up in the Parisian suburbs and I was the cadet of a family of three children.": 1,
    "I had a normal dad, like the others, apart from the fact that he was 30 years older, that he was especially old enough to be my grandfather.": 1,
    " In any case, he was a photographer, he was a street educator, and he always taught us to obey the law strictly.": 1,
    "And of his life before, when he was a faucer, of course he never talked about it.": 1,
    " But there was an episode that I'm going to tell you that may have been able to put me to sleep.": 1,
    "I was in high school.": 1,
    " And I had a bad grade, which happened rather rarely.": 1,
    "In any case, I decided to hide it from my parents.": 1,
    "And to do this, I thought I was going to falsify their signature.": 1,
    " I attacked the signature of my mother because my father's signature is absolutely infallible.": 1,
    "So for a little while, I took a bunch of leaves, I trained, I trained, I trained until I got the right hand, and I started acting.": 1,
    " A little later, while searching in my notebook, my mother found the copy and she immediately saw that the signature was false.": 1,
    "I got yelled at like never before, I went to hide in my room, to hide under the blanket, and I waited for my father to come home from work with, we can say, a lot of apprehension.": 1,
    " I heard him come in.": 1,
    "I stayed under the covers.": 1,
    "He came into my room.": 1,
    " He sat on the corner of the bed and didn't say anything, so I took off my head under the blankets and when he saw me, he burst into laughter.": 1,
    "He burst into laughter and couldn't stop, and he had the blanket in his hand and he said to me, but finally Sarah, you could have applied, you see that she is too small.": 1,
    " Indeed, she is a bit small.": 1,
    " I was in Algeria.": 1,
    "There I heard that my father was a mujahid, that means a fighter.": 1,
    "And then later in France I left him in my ears to listen to the conversations of the adults.": 1,
    " and I heard all kinds of things about my father's life before, and I heard that he had done the Second World War, that he had done the Algerian War.": 1,
    " And in my head I thought that war was being a soldier.": 1,
    "And knowing my father, and that he was a pacifist and not violent, I still had a hard time imagining him with a helmet and a rifle.": 1,
    "Indeed, I was far from the story.": 1,
    " Un jour, alors que mon p\u00e8re constituait un dossier pour qu'on obtienne tous la nationalit\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise, j'ai vu passer des documents qui m'ont interpell\u00e9.": 1,
    " This is mine.": 1,
    "I signed it yesterday.": 1,
    "But the document that I saw that was going to help us to form our file, it was a document that came from the army and that thanked me.": 1,
    " my father for his work that he had done for the secret services.": 1,
    "So suddenly I said to myself, wow, my father is a secret agent, that would be very James Bond.": 1,
    "And I wanted to ask him questions that he did not answer.": 1,
    " And later, I told myself that one day I would have to question him.": 1,
    "And I was myself the mother of a little boy when I told myself that it was time, that he absolutely had to talk to us.": 1,
    " I had just become a mother, he was 77 years old, and suddenly I was very scared.": 1,
    "I was afraid that he would take away his silences, his secrets.": 1,
    " And I managed to convince him that it was important for us, but maybe also for the others, to share his story.": 1,
    "And he decided to tell it to me, and I made a book about it, which I will read to you shortly.": 1,
    "So, his story.": 1,
    "My father was born in Argentina.": 1,
    " He had parents of Russian origin.": 1,
    "And his whole family came to live in France in the 1930s.": 1,
    "His parents were Jewish.": 1,
    " so Russian, and especially very poor.": 1,
    "So at the age of 14, my father had to work.": 1,
    "And with his only diploma, the certificate of primary education, he found himself hired in a dye shop.": 1,
    " And that's where he discovered something absolutely magical for him, and when he talks about it, it's fascinating.": 1,
    "It's the magic of coloring chemistry.": 1,
    " At that time it was war, and his mother was murdered when he was 15 years old.": 1,
    "And it coincided with the moment when he threw himself into chemistry because it was the only comfort to his sadness.": 1,
    " All day long, he asked his boss a lot of questions to gain more knowledge, and at night, at the blink of an eye, he practiced all his experiments, and he was particularly interested in the decoloration of the ink.": 1,
    " All this to tell you?": 1,
    " that if my father was a scavenger, in reality it was almost by chance.": 1,
    "So they were Jewish and chased.": 1,
    "Finally, his whole family was arrested and transported to the camp of Bransy and they managed to get an extremist out of their Argentinian papers.": 1,
    " Only they were outside, but still in danger, and there was always the big stamp on their papers.": 1,
    "It was his father who decided that they needed fake papers.": 1,
    "And my father had been raised in such respect for legality that he could have been persecuted for fake papers and he had never thought about it.": 1,
    " He was the one who went to the meeting with the man of the Resistance.": 1,
    "At the time, the papers were cartoned, they were filled by hand, and the job was displayed on them.": 1,
    " It was necessary for him to survive, for him to work.": 1,
    "He asked this man to paint him.": 1,
    "And suddenly, the man seemed very, very interested.": 1,
    "He began to paint, and he pulled out the ink stains.": 1,
    " Of course, he knew it.": 1,
    "And suddenly, the man explains that all resistance has a huge problem, including the most famous experts, they can't erase an ink, called indelible, the blue waterman ink.": 1,
    " And my father answered the tacotak that he knew exactly how to withdraw it.": 1,
    "So obviously, the man very impressed by this 17-year-old boy who gives him the tacotak formula, obviously recruited him.": 1,
    " And in fact, without knowing it, my father had just invented something that can be found today in the trunks of all schoolchildren.": 1,
    "I called it the eraser.": 1,
    " But it was only the beginning.": 1,
    "It was my father.": 1,
    "As soon as he arrived at the lab, although he was the youngest, he immediately saw that there was a problem in terms of fake paper manufacturing.": 1,
    "In fact, all the movements were trying to be falsified.": 1,
    " But there were more and more requests because it was difficult to make existing papers.": 1,
    "He said he had to make them, he launched the printing, he launched the photographing.": 1,
    " He started to reproduce tampons, he started to invent all sorts of things.": 1,
    "With equipment, he invented a centrifuge with a bicycle wheel.": 1,
    "All this, in any case, he had to do it because he was absolutely stunned by the performance.": 1,
    "He had done a simple calculation.": 1,
    " In one hour, he made 30 false papers.": 1,
    "If he slept an hour, 30 people would have gone.": 1,
    "So much so that this feeling of responsibility of the life of others, when he was only 17,": 1,
    " And also this guilt of being a survivor, since he was out of the camp when his friends stayed, he kept it all his life.": 1,
    " And this may also explain that for 30 years, he continued to make fake papers and at the cost of all sacrifices.": 1,
    "I would like to talk about sacrifices because there were several.": 1,
    "There were obviously financial sacrifices.": 1,
    " Because he always refused to be paid.": 1,
    "Because being paid meant being a mercenary.": 1,
    "Because if he accepted to be paid, he couldn't say yes or no, depending on whether the cause seemed right to him or not.": 1,
    "So much so that he was a photographer during the day, loitering at night for 30 years, and loitering all the time.": 1,
    " And then there were sentimental sacrifices.": 1,
    "How to live with a woman while having so many secrets?": 1,
    "How to explain to her what we are going to do at night in the laboratory, every night?": 1,
    " Obviously, there was another type of family sacrifice that I understood later.": 1,
    "One day, my father introduced me to my sister.": 1,
    " He explained to me that I also had a brother, and the first time I saw them I was 3 or 4 years old, and they were 30 years older than me.": 1,
    "Today they are 60 years old, both of them.": 1,
    " Yeah.": 1,
    " And for the needs of writing the book, I was questioned by my sister, and I wanted to know who was my father, who was the father she knew.": 1,
    "And she explained to me that this father she had,": 1,
    " He told them that he would pick them up on Sunday to take them for a walk.": 1,
    "And that he was waiting for them, that they were almost never coming.": 1,
    "He said, I'm going to call you.": 1,
    "They didn't call.": 1,
    "And then they didn't come.": 1,
    "And then...": 1,
    " And then one day he completely disappeared.": 1,
    "And then time passed and it was said that he had surely forgotten them in the first place.": 1,
    "And then as time always passed, after almost two years they said to each other, finally maybe our father is dead.": 1,
    " And in fact, I understood!": 1,
    " The fact of asking all these questions to my father brought back a past that he didn't want to talk about because it was painful.": 1,
    "And while my half-sister and half-brother thought they were abandoned, even orphans,": 1,
    " My father made fake papers.": 1,
    " And if he didn't tell them, it was to protect them, of course.": 1,
    "After liberation, he made fake papers to allow the rescapers of the camps to emigrate to Palestine before the creation of Israel.": 1,
    "And then, because he was an anti-colonialist convinced, he made fake papers for Algerians during the Algerian War.": 1,
    " And then, after the Algerian War, within international resistance movements, the name started to circulate.": 1,
    "And the whole world came knocking at its door.": 1,
    " In Africa, there were countries fighting for their independence.": 1,
    "Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Angola.": 1,
    "And then my father allied himself with the anti-apartheid party of Nelson Mandela.": 1,
    "He made fake papers for black South Africans persecuted.": 1,
    " There was also Latin America.": 1,
    "My father came in aid to the dictatorships of Saint Domingue Island, Haiti, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Salvador, Nicaragua, Colombia, Peru.": 1,
    " Uruguay, Chile and Mexico.": 1,
    " And then it was also the Vietnam War.": 1,
    "My father made fake papers for the American deserters who did not want to carry weapons against the Vietnamese.": 1,
    " And then Europe was not spared.": 1,
    "My father made the false papers for Franco's dissidents in Spain, also against Salazar in Portugal, and also against the dictatorship of the colonels in Greece.": 1,
    " Am I not false?": 1,
    " Only once.": 1,
    "It happened in May 1968.": 1,
    "My father watched the protests in May, but his heart was elsewhere, and his time too, because he had more than 15 countries to serve.": 1,
    " Once again, he accepted to make fake papers for someone you may recognize.": 1,
    " He was much younger at the time and my father agreed to make fake papers to allow him to come back and take the floor at a meeting.": 1,
    " And he told me that these fake papers were the most media and the least useful he had ever had to do in his life.": 1,
    "But what he accepted to do, although Daniel's life was not in danger, was...": 1,
    " Because it was a great opportunity to show the authorities that there is nothing more porous than a border, and that they don't have any ideas.": 1,
    " During my childhood, my father told me stories of very discreet heroes with unwavering utopias, who were able to accomplish miracles.": 1,
    " And these heroes, we didn't need an army behind them, no one would have followed them except a handful of men and women of conviction and courage.": 1,
    "And I understood later that it was his own story that my father told me to fall asleep.": 1,
    " I asked him if, in view of the sacrifices he had to make, he had already come to regret.": 1,
    "He said no.": 1,
    "He said that he would have been unable to look or suffer injustice without doing anything, and that he was convinced and that he remained convinced.": 1,
    " that another world is possible, a world where no one would need a greenhouse anymore.": 1,
    "My father is in the room today.": 1,
    "His name is Adolfo Kalinsky.": 1
