    " Last year, I went on my first book tour.": 1,
    "In 13 months, I flew to 14 countries and gave some 100 talks.": 1,
    " Every talk in every country began with an introduction, and every introduction began, alas, with a lie.": 1,
    " Taie Selassie comes from Ghana and Nigeria, or Taie Selassie comes from England and the States.": 1,
    "Whenever I heard this opening sentence, no matter the country that concluded it,": 1,
    " England, America, Ghana, Nigeria, I thought, but that's not true.": 1,
    "Yes, I was born in England and grew up in the United States.": 1,
    "My mom, born in England and raised in Nigeria,": 1,
    " currently lives in Ghana.": 1,
    "My father was born in Gold Coast, a British colony raised in Ghana, and has lived for over 30 years in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.": 1,
    "For this reason,": 1,
    " My introducers also called me multinational.": 1,
    "But Nike is multinational, I thought.": 1,
    " I'm a human being.": 1,
    "Then, one fine day, mid-tour, I went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark where I shared the stage with the writer Colin McCann.": 1,
    " We were discussing the role of locality in writing when suddenly it hit me.": 1,
    "I'm not multinational.": 1,
    "I'm not a national at all.": 1,
    "How could I come from a nation?": 1,
    " How can a human being come from a concept?": 1,
    "It's a question that had been bothering me for going on two decades, from newspapers, textbooks, conversations,": 1,
    " I'd learned to speak of countries as if they were eternal, singular, naturally occurring things.": 1,
    "But I wondered.": 1,
    " To say that I came from a country suggested that the country was an absolute, some fixed point in place and time, a constant thing.": 1,
    "But was it?": 1,
    " In my lifetime, countries had disappeared, Czechoslovakia appeared, Timor-Leste failed, Somalia.": 1,
    "My parents came from countries that didn't exist when they were born.": 1,
    " To me, a country, this thing that could be born, die, expand, contract, hardly seemed the basis for understanding a human being.": 1,
    " And so, it came as a huge relief to discover the sovereign state.": 1,
    "What we call countries are actually various expressions of sovereign statehood, an idea that came into fashion only 400 years ago.": 1,
    " When I learned this, beginning my master's degree in international relations, I felt a sort of surge of relief.": 1,
    "It was as I had suspected.": 1,
    "History was real.": 1,
    " Cultures were real, but countries were invented.": 1,
    "For the next 10 years, I sought to re- or undefine myself, my world, my work, my experience, beyond the logic of the state.": 1,
    " In 2005, I wrote an essay, What is an Afropolitan?": 1,
    "sketching out an identity that privileged culture over country.": 1,
    " It was thrilling how many people could relate to my experience, and instructional how many others didn't buy my sense of self.": 1,
    " How can Selassie claim to come from Ghana, one such critic asked, when she's never known the indignities of traveling abroad on a Ghanaian passport?": 1,
    " Now, if I'm honest, I knew just what she meant.": 1,
    "I've got a friend named Leila, who was born and raised in Ghana.": 1,
    " Her parents are third-generation Ghanaians of Lebanese descent.": 1,
    "Leila, who speaks fluent Shri, knows a kral like the back of her hand.": 1,
    " But when we first met, years ago, I thought, she's not from Ghana.": 1,
    "In my mind, she came from Lebanon, despite the patent fact that all her formative experience took place in Suburban Accra.": 1,
    " I, like my critics, was imagining some Ghana where all Ghanaians had brown skin or none held UK passports.": 1,
    " I'd fallen into the limiting trap that the language of coming from countries sets, the privileging of a fiction, the singular country, over reality, human experience.": 1,
    " Speaking with Carla McCann that day, the penny finally dropped.": 1,
    " All experience is local, he said.": 1,
    "All identity is experience, I thought.": 1,
    "I'm not a national, I proclaimed on stage.": 1,
    "I'm a local.": 1,
    " I'm multi-loco.": 1,
    "See, Thay Selassie comes from the United States, isn't the truth.": 1,
    "I have no relationship with the United States, all 50 of them.": 1,
    "Not really.": 1,
    " My relationship is with Brookline, the town where I grew up, with New York City, where I started work, with Lawrenceville, where I spend Thanksgiving.": 1,
    " What makes America home for me is not my passport or accent, but these very particular experiences and the places": 1,
    " they occur.": 1,
    "Despite my pride in ewe culture, the black stars and my love of Ghanaian food, I've never had a relationship with the Republic of Ghana writ large.": 1,
    " My relationship is with Accra, where my mother lives, where I go each year, with a little garden in Jovalu, where my father and I talk for hours.": 1,
    " These are the places that shape my experience.": 1,
    "My experience is where I'm from.": 1,
    "What if we asked, instead of, where are you from?": 1,
    "Where are you a local?": 1,
    " This would tell us so much more about who and how similar we are.": 1,
    "Tell me you're from France and I see what?": 1,
    "A set of clich\u00e9s.": 1,
    "Adichie's dangerous single story, the myth of the nation of France.": 1,
    " Tell me you're a local of Fez and Paris, better yet, C\u00f4te d'Or, and I see a set of experiences.": 1,
    "Our experience is where we're from.": 1,
    " So, where are you a loco?": 1,
    "I propose a three-step test.": 1,
    "I call these the three Rs.": 1,
    "Rituals, relationships, restrictions.": 1,
    " First, think of your daily rituals, whatever they may be.": 1,
    "Making your coffee, driving to work, harvesting your crops, saying your prayers.": 1,
    "What kind of rituals are these?": 1,
    "Where do they occur?": 1,
    " In what city or cities in the world do shopkeepers know your face?": 1,
    "As a child, I carried out fairly standard suburban rituals in Boston, with adjustments made for the rituals my mother brought from London and Lagos.": 1,
    " We took off our shoes in the house.": 1,
    "We were unfailingly polite with our elders.": 1,
    "We ate slow-cooked spicy food.": 1,
    "In snowy North America, ours were rituals of the Global South.": 1,
    " The first time I went to Delhi or to southern parts of Italy, I was shocked by how at home I felt the rituals were familiar.": 1,
    "Our number one.": 1,
    "Rituals.": 1,
    " Now, think of your relationships of the people who shape your days.": 1,
    "To whom do you speak at least once a week, be it face-to-face or on FaceTime?": 1,
    " Be reasonable in your assessment.": 1,
    "I'm not talking about your Facebook friends.": 1,
    "I'm speaking of the people who shape your weekly emotional experience.": 1,
    " My mother in Accra, my twin sister in Boston, my best friends in New York, these relationships are home for me.": 1,
    "Our number two, relationships.": 1,
    " We're local where we carry out our rituals and relationships, but how we experience our locality depends in part on our restrictions.": 1,
    " By restrictions, I mean, where are you able to live?": 1,
    "What passport do you hold?": 1,
    "Are you restricted by, say, racism from feeling fully at home where you live?": 1,
    " by civil war, dysfunctional governance, economic inflation, from living in the locality where you had your rituals as a child.": 1,
    "This is the least sexy of the Rs, less lyric than rituals and relationships.": 1,
    " But the question takes us past, where are you now, to why aren't you there and why?": 1,
    " Rituals, relationships, restrictions.": 1,
    "Take a piece of paper and put those three words on top of three columns.": 1,
    " then try to fill those columns as honestly as you can.": 1,
    "A very different picture of your life in local context, of your identity as a set of experiences may emerge.": 1,
    "So let's try it.": 1,
    " I have a friend named Olu.": 1,
    "He's 35 years old.": 1,
    "His parents, born in Nigeria, came to Germany on scholarships.": 1,
    "Olu was born in Nuremberg and lived there till age 10.": 1,
    "When his family moved to Lagos, he studied in London, then came to Berlin.": 1,
    " He loves going to Nigeria, the weather, the food, the friends, but hates the political corruption there.": 1,
    " Where is Olu from?": 1,
    "I have another friend named Udo.": 1,
    "He's also 35 years old.": 1,
    "Udo was born in Cordova.": 1,
    " in northwest Argentina, where his grandparents migrated from Germany, what is now Poland after the war.": 1,
    "Udo studied in Buenos Aires and nine years ago came to Berlin.": 1,
    " He loves going to Argentina, the weather, the food, the friends, but hates the economic corruption there.": 1,
    "Where is Udo from?": 1,
    " With his blonde hair and blue eyes, Udo could pass for German, but holds an Argentinian passport so needs a visa to live in Berlin.": 1,
    " that Uros from Argentina has largely to do with history, that he's a local of Buenos Aires and Berlin, that has to do with life.": 1,
    " Olu, who looks Nigerian, needs a visa to visit Nigeria.": 1,
    "He speaks Yoruba with an English accent and English with a German one.": 1,
    " To claim that he's not really Nigerian, though, denies his experience in Lagos, the rituals he practiced growing up, his relationship with family and friends.": 1,
    " Meanwhile, the Lagos is undoubtedly one of his homes.": 1,
    "Olu always feels restricted there, not least by the fact that he's gay.": 1,
    " Both he and Udo are restricted by the political conditions of their parents' countries from living where some of their most meaningful rituals and relationships occur.": 1,
    " To say Olu is from Nigeria and Udo from Argentina distracts from their common experience.": 1,
    "Their rituals, their relationships, and their restrictions are the same.": 1,
    " Of course, when we ask, where are you from, we're using a kind of shorthand.": 1,
    "It's quicker to say Nigeria than Lagos and Berlin.": 1,
    " And as with Google Maps, we can always zoom in closer from country to city to neighborhood, but that's not quite the point.": 1,
    " The difference between where are you from and where are you a local isn't the specificity of the answer, it's the intention of the question.": 1,
    " Replacing the language of nationality with the language of locality asks us to shift our focus to where real life occurs.": 1,
    " Even that most glorious expression of countryhood, the World Cup, gives us national teams comprised mostly of multi-local players.": 1,
    " As a unit of measurement for human experience, the country doesn't quite work.": 1,
    "That's why Olu says, I'm German, but my parents come from Nigeria.": 1,
    " The but in that sentence belies the inflexibility of the units, one fixed and fictional entity bumping up against another.": 1,
    " I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin suggests overlapping experiences, layers that merge together that can't be denied or removed.": 1,
    " You can take away my passport, but you can't take away my experience.": 1,
    "That I carry within me.": 1,
    "Where I'm from comes wherever I go.": 1,
    " To be clear, I'm not suggesting that we do away with countries.": 1,
    "There's much to be said for national history more for the sovereign state.": 1,
    "Culture exists in community and community exists in context.": 1,
    " Geography, tradition, collective memory, these things are important.": 1,
    "What I'm questioning is primacy.": 1,
    " All of those introductions on tour began with reference to nation, as if knowing what country I came from would tell my audience who I was.": 1,
    " What are we really seeking, though, when we ask where someone comes from?": 1,
    "And what are we really seeing when we hear an answer?": 1,
    "Here's one possibility.": 1,
    "Basically, countries represent power.": 1,
    " Where are you from?": 1,
    "Mexico, Poland, Bangladesh.": 1,
    "Less power.": 1,
    "America, Germany, Japan.": 1,
    "More power.": 1,
    "China, Russia.": 1,
    "Ambiguous.": 1,
    "It's ...": 1,
    " It's possible that without realizing it, we're playing a power game, especially in the context of multi-ethnic countries.": 1,
    "As any recent immigrant knows, the question, where are you from, or where are you really from, is often code for": 1,
    " Why are you here?": 1,
    "Then we have the scholar William DeReseret's writing of elite American colleges, quote, Students think that their environment is diverse if one comes from Missouri and another from Pakistan.": 1,
    " Never mind that all of their parents are doctors or bankers.\"": 1,
    "I'm with him.": 1,
    "To call one student American, another Pakistani, then triumphantly claim student body diversity,": 1,
    " ignores the fact that these students are locals of the same milieu.": 1,
    "The same holds true on the other end of the economic spectrum.": 1,
    " A Mexican gardener in Los Angeles and a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi have more in common in terms of rituals and restrictions than nationality implies.": 1,
    " Perhaps my biggest problem with coming from countries is the myth of going back to them.": 1,
    "I'm often asked if I plan to go back to Ghana.": 1,
    "I go to Accra every year, but I can't go back to Ghana.": 1,
    " It's not because I wasn't born there.": 1,
    "My father can't go back either.": 1,
    "The country in which he was born, that country no longer exists.": 1,
    " We can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it Something somewhere will always have changed most of all ourselves": 1,
    " people.": 1,
    "Finally, what we're talking about is human experience, this notoriously and gloriously disorderly affair.": 1,
    " In creative writing, locality bespeaks humanity.": 1,
    "The more we know about where a story is set, the more local color and texture, the more human the characters start to feel, the more relatable, not less.": 1,
    " The myth of national identity and the vocabulary of coming from confuses us into placing ourselves into mutually exclusive categories.": 1,
    "In fact, all of us are multi, multi local, multi layered.": 1,
    " to begin our conversations with an acknowledgement of this complexity brings us closer together, I think, not further apart.": 1,
    " So, the next time that I'm introduced, I'd love to hear the truth.": 1,
    "Tayyip Silasi is a human being like everybody here.": 1,
    " She isn't a citizen of the world, but a citizen of worlds.": 1,
    "She is a local of New York, Rome and Accra.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
