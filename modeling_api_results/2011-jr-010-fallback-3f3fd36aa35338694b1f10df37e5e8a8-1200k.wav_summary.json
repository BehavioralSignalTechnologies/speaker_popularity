    " you": 3,
    " A few weeks ago, I was in my studio in Paris and the phone rang and I heard, hey, JR, you won the TED Prize 2011.": 1,
    "You have to make a wish to save the world.": 1,
    " I was lost.": 1,
    "I mean, I can't save the world.": 1,
    "Nobody can.": 1,
    "The world is fucked up.": 1,
    "Come on.": 1,
    "You have dictators ruling the world.": 1,
    "Population is going by million.": 1,
    "There's no more fish in the sea.": 1,
    " The North Pole is melting.": 1,
    "And as the last state prize winner said, we're all becoming fat.": 1,
    " except maybe friends, people.": 1,
    "So, whatever.": 1,
    "So, I call back.": 1,
    " And I told her, look, Amy, tell the guys I just want to show up.": 1,
    "I can't do anything to save the world.": 1,
    "She said, hey, JR, you wish not to save the world but to change the world.": 1,
    "Oh, all right.": 1,
    " That's cool.": 1,
    "I mean, technology, politics, business do change the world.": 1,
    "Not always in a good way, but they do.": 1,
    "What about art?": 1,
    "Could art change the world?": 1,
    " I started when I was 15 years old, and at that time, I was not thinking about changing the world.": 1,
    "I was doing graffiti, writing my names everywhere, using the city as a canvas.": 1,
    " I was going in the tunnels of Paris on the rooftops with my friends.": 1,
    "Each trip was an excursion, was an adventure.": 1,
    "It was like leaving our mark on society to say I was here, you know, on the top of a building.": 1,
    " So when I found a cheap camera in the subway, I started documenting those adventures with my friend and give them back into photocopies.": 1,
    "Really small photos, just that size.": 1,
    " That's how, at 17 years old, I started pasting them.": 1,
    "And I did my first expo de rue, which means sidewalk gallery.": 1,
    "And I framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising.": 1,
    " I mean, the city is the best gallery I could imagine.": 1,
    "I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was, you know, nice enough to show it to people.": 1,
    "I would confront it directly with the public in the streets.": 1,
    " So that's Paris.": 1,
    "I would change, depending on the places where I would go, the title of the exhibition.": 1,
    " That's on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.": 1,
    "I was quite proud of that one.": 1,
    "Because I was just aiding, I was just up there on the top of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.": 1,
    "And when the photo left, you know, the frame was still there.": 1,
    " November 2005.": 1,
    "The streets are burning.": 1,
    "A large wave of riots had broken in the first projects of Paris.": 1,
    "Everyone was glued to the TV.": 1,
    " watching disturbing, frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood.": 1,
    " I mean, these kids without control.": 1,
    " showing Molotov cocktails, attacking the cops and the firemen, looting everything they could in the shops.": 1,
    "These were criminals, thugs, dangerous, destroying their own environment.": 1,
    " And then I saw it.": 1,
    "Could it be possible?": 1,
    "My photo on a wall.": 1,
    " Revealed by a burning car, a pasting I've done a year earlier, an illegal one, still there.": 1,
    "I mean, these were the faces of my friends.": 1,
    "I know those guys.": 1,
    "All of them are not angels, but they're not monsters either.": 1,
    " So it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes that back at me through the television.": 1,
    "So I went back there with a 28 millimeter lens.": 1,
    " It was the only one I had at that time, but with that length, you have to be as close as 10 inches from the person.": 1,
    "So you can do it only with that trust.": 1,
    " So I took full portraits of people from Lebowski.": 1,
    " They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves.": 1,
    " And then I pasted huge poster everywhere in the Bourgeois area of Paris with their name, age, even building number.": 1,
    " of these guys.": 1,
    " A year later, the exhibition was displayed in front of the City Hall of Paris.": 1,
    "And you go from the images who've been stolen and distorted by the media, who's now proudly taking over his own image.": 1,
    " That's where I realized the power of paper and glue.": 1,
    " So could art change the world?": 1,
    " A year later, I was listening to all the noise about the Middle East conflict.": 1,
    "At that time, trust me, they were only referring to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.": 1,
    " So with my friend Marco, we decided to go there and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis.": 1,
    "Are they so different?": 1,
    " When we got there, we just went in the street, started talking with people everywhere, and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media.": 1,
    " So we decided to take portraits of Palestinians and Israelis doing the same jobs.": 1,
    "Taxi driver, lawyer, cooks.": 1,
    " ask them to make a face as a sign of commitment.": 1,
    "Not a smile that really doesn't tell about who you are and what you feel.": 1,
    "They all accepted to be pasted next to the other.": 1,
    " I decided to paste in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities.": 1,
    "And on both sides of the wall, we launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever.": 1,
    "We called the project Face to Face.": 1,
    " The experts say no way.": 1,
    " The people will not accept.": 1,
    "The army will shoot you.": 1,
    "The Hamas will kidnap you.": 1,
    "You say, OK, let's try and push as far as we can.": 1,
    " I love the way that people will ask me, how big will be my photo?": 1,
    "Oh, it will be as big as your house.": 1,
    " When we did the wall, we did the Palestinian side, so we arrived with just a ladder, and we realized that they were not high enough, you know?": 1,
    "And so a Palestinian guy said, okay, calm down, no way, I'm going to find you a solution.": 1,
    "So he went to the Church of Nativity.": 1,
    " and bring back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born.": 1,
    " We did face to face with only six friends, two ladders, two brushes, a rented car, a camera, and 20,000 square feet of paper.": 1,
    " We had all sorts of help from all walks of life.": 1,
    " Okay, for example, that's Palestine.": 1,
    "We're in Ramallah right now.": 1,
    "We're pasting portraits, so both portraits, in the streets in a crowded market.": 1,
    " People come around us and start asking, what are you doing here?": 1,
    "Oh, we're actually doing an art project.": 1,
    "And we're placing an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job.": 1,
    "And those ones are actually two taxi drivers.": 1,
    "And then there was always a silence.": 1,
    " You mean you're pasting an Israeli face, doing a face right here?": 1,
    "Yeah, yeah, that's part of the project.": 1,
    "And then I would always leave that moment and we would ask them, so can you tell me who is who?": 1,
    " and most of them couldn't say.": 1,
    " We even pasted on Israeli military tower, and nothing happened.": 1,
    "You know when you paste an image, it's just paper and glue.": 1,
    "I mean, people can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it, even some are a bit higher for that, I agree.": 1,
    " The people in the street, they are the curator.": 1,
    "The rain and the wind will take them off anyway.": 1,
    "They are not meant to stay.": 1,
    "But exactly four years after, the photos, most of them are still there.": 1,
    " face-to-face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible.": 1,
    "And you know what?": 1,
    "Even easy.": 1,
    "We didn't push the limit, we just showed that they were further than anyone thought.": 1,
    " In the Middle East, I experienced my work in places with not much museums.": 1,
    "So directions in the street were, you know, kind of interesting.": 1,
    "So I decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there is zero museums.": 1,
    " You know, when you go on in these developing societies, women are the pillars of their community.": 1,
    "But the men are still the ones holding the streets.": 1,
    "So we're inspired to create a project where men": 1,
    " will pay tribute to women by posting their photos.": 1,
    " I call that project Women Are Heroes.": 1,
    " When I listened to all the stories everywhere I went on the continents, I couldn't always understand the complicated circumstances.": 1,
    " of their conflict.": 1,
    "I just observed.": 1,
    "Sometimes there was no words, no sentence, just tears.": 1,
    " I just took their pictures.": 1,
    " and paste them.": 1,
    " Women are heroes took me around the world.": 1,
    " Most of the places I went to, I decided to go there because I've heard about it through the media.": 1,
    "So, for example, in June 2008, I was watching TV in Paris.": 1,
    " And then I heard about this terrible thing that happened in Rio de Janeiro, in the first travel of Brazil named Providencia.": 1,
    "Three kids, that was three students, were controlled by the army because they were not carrying their papers.": 1,
    " And the army took them.": 1,
    "And instead of bringing them to the police station, they bring them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces.": 1,
    " I was shocked.": 1,
    "All Brazil was shocked.": 1,
    "I heard that it was one of the most violent favelas because the largest drug cartel controls it.": 1,
    "So I decided to go there.": 1,
    "When I arrived, I mean,": 1,
    " I didn't have any contact with any NGO.": 1,
    "There was none in place.": 1,
    "No association, no NGOs, nothing.": 1,
    "No eyes witnessed.": 1,
    "So we just walked around and we met a woman.": 1,
    " And I show her my book.": 1,
    "And she said, you know what?": 1,
    "We're hungry of culture.": 1,
    "We need culture up there.": 1,
    " So I went up and I started with the kids.": 1,
    " I just took a few photos of the kids and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them.": 1,
    "The day after I came back, they were already scratched.": 1,
    "But that's okay.": 1,
    "I wanted them to feel that the art belongs to them.": 1,
    " Then the next day, I held a meeting on the main square, and some women came.": 1,
    "They were all linked to the three kids that got killed.": 1,
    "There was the mother, the grandmother, the best friend.": 1,
    "They all wanted to share the story.": 1,
    " After that day, everyone in the Fabular gave me the green light.": 1,
    "I took more photos and we started the project.": 1,
    " The drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place, so I told them, you know what, I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons.": 1,
    "See that enough in the media.": 1,
    "What I want to show is the incredible life and energy I've been, you know, seeing around me the last few days.": 1,
    " So that's a really symbolic pasting, because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the CD.": 1,
    "And that's where the three kids got arrested.": 1,
    " And that's the grandmother of one of them.": 1,
    "And on that stairs, that's where the traffic can always stand and there's a lot of exchange of fire.": 1,
    "Everyone there understood the project.": 1,
    " And then we paste it everywhere, the whole hill.": 1,
    " What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in.": 1,
    "I mean, you should see that.": 1,
    "They would have to film us from a really long distance, you know, by helicopter, and then have a really long lens, and we would see ourselves on TV pasting.": 1,
    "And they would put a number, please call this number if you know what's going on in Providencia.": 1,
    " We just did a project and then left.": 1,
    " So the media were like, oh, so how can we know about the project?": 1,
    "So they had to go and find the woman, you know, and get an explanation from them.": 1,
    "So you create a bridge between the media and the anonymous woman.": 1,
    " We kept traveling.": 1,
    "We went to Africa, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Kenya.": 1,
    " In work on places like Moravia, people come straight to you.": 1,
    "I mean, they want to know what you're up to.": 1,
    "They keep asking you, what is the purpose of your project?": 1,
    "Are you an NGO?": 1,
    "Are you the media?": 1,
    "Art, just doing art.": 1,
    " Some people question, why is it in black and white?": 1,
    "Don't you have color in France?": 1,
    "They tell you, like, are these people all dead?": 1,
    "Some who understood the project will explain it to others.": 1,
    " And to a man who didn't understand, I heard someone say, you know, you've been here for a few hours trying to understand, discussing with your fellows.": 1,
    "During that time, you haven't think about what you're going to eat tomorrow.": 1,
    "This is art.": 1,
    " I think it's people's curiosity that motivates them to come into the project.": 1,
    "And then it becomes more.": 1,
    "It becomes a desire, a need, an element.": 1,
    " On this bridge that's in Moravia, ex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait of a woman that might have been raped during the war.": 1,
    "Women are always the first ones targeted during conflict.": 1,
    " This is Kibera, Kenya, one of the largest slums of Africa.": 1,
    "You might have seen images about the post-election violence that happened there in 2008.": 1,
    " This time we covered the roof of the houses, but we didn't use paper.": 1,
    " Paper doesn't prevent the rain from leaking inside the house.": 1,
    "Vinyl does.": 1,
    "Then art becomes useful.": 1,
    " So the people kept it.": 1,
    "You know what I love is that, for example, when you see the biggest eye there, there's so much houses inside.": 1,
    "And I went there a few months ago, photos are still there, and there was missing a piece of an eye.": 1,
    "So I asked the people, what happened?": 1,
    "Oh, the guy just moved.": 1,
    " It's there.": 1,
    " When the move was covered, a woman said as a joke, now God can see me.": 1,
    "When you look at Kibbera now, they look back.": 1,
    " Okay, India.": 1,
    "Before I start there, just so you know, each time we go in a place, we don't have authorization, so we set up like commandos.": 1,
    "You know, we're a group of friends, we arrive there and we try to place on the walls.": 1,
    "But there's places where you just can't place on the wall.": 1,
    " In India, it was just impossible to paste.": 1,
    "I heard culturally and because of the law, they would just arrest us at the first pasting.": 1,
    "So we decided to paste it white.": 1,
    " white on the wall.": 1,
    "So imagine, white guys pasting white papers.": 1,
    "So people would come to us and ask us, hey, what are you up to?": 1,
    "Oh, you know, we're just doing art, art.": 1,
    " Of course they were confused.": 1,
    "But you know how India has a lot of dust in the street?": 1,
    "And the more dust you would have going up in the air.": 1,
    " on the white paper, you can almost see that there's a sticky part, you know, like when you reverse a sticker.": 1,
    "So the more dust you have, the more it will reveal the photo.": 1,
    "So we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photo would get revealed by themselves.": 1,
    " So we didn't get caught this time.": 1,
    " Each project, that's a film from Women Are Heroes.": 1,
    " Okay, for each project we do a film.": 1,
    "And most of what you see here, that's a trailer for Moona Heroes.": 1,
    " It's images, photography, taken one after the others.": 1,
    " and the photo kept traveling even without us.": 1,
    " Hopefully you'll see the film and you'll understand the scape of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos.": 1,
    "Because that's a big part of it.": 1,
    "There's layers behind each photo, behind each image.": 1,
    "There's the story.": 1,
    " Women heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities, and the women kept that dynamic after we left.": 1,
    "For example, we did books, not for sale, that all the community would get.": 1,
    "But to get it, they would have to make it signed by one of the women.": 1,
    " We did that in most of the places.": 1,
    "We go back regularly.": 1,
    "And so in Providencia, for example, in the favela, we have a cultural center running there.": 1,
    "In Kibera, each year we cover more roofs.": 1,
    "Because, of course, when we left, the people say, you know, that was just at the edge of the project, say, what about my roof?": 1,
    " So we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project.": 1,
    " Really important point for me is that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors.": 1,
    "So I have no responsibility to anyone but myself and the subject.": 1,
    " And that is for me like one of the most important things in the work.": 1,
    "You know, I think today,": 1,
    " As much as important as the result is the way you do things, and that have always been a certain part of the world.": 1,
    "And what's interesting is that fine line that I have with images and advertising.": 1,
    "We just did some pasting in Los Angeles on another project in the last weeks.": 1,
    " and I even was invited to cover the Mocha Museum.": 1,
    " But yesterday, the city called them and said, look, you're going to have to tear it down, because this can be taken for advertising.": 1,
    "And because of the law, it has to be taken down.": 1,
    "But tell me, advertising for what?": 1,
    " The people I photographed were proud to participate to the project and to have their photo in their community.": 1,
    "But they asked me for a promise, basically.": 1,
    "They asked me, please, make our story travel with you.": 1,
    "So I did.": 1,
    "That's Paris.": 1,
    " That's Rio.": 1,
    "In each place we build exhibitions with the story and the story travel and you understand the full scape of the project.": 1,
    "That's London.": 1,
    "New York.": 1,
    " And today, they are with you in Long Beach.": 1,
    "All right.": 1,
    "Recently, I started a public art project where I don't use my artwork anymore.": 1,
    "I used Man Ray, Ellen Leavitt.": 1,
    " Giacomelli, other people that work.": 1,
    "It doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not.": 1,
    "The importance is what you do with the images.": 1,
    "The statement it makes where it's pasted.": 1,
    " So, for example, I posted the photo of the minaret in Switzerland a few weeks after they voted a law forbidding minarets in the country.": 1,
    " This image of three men wearing gas masks were taken in Chernobyl originally, and I pasted it in southern Italy, where the mafia sometimes buried the garbage under the ground.": 1,
    " In some way, art can change the world.": 1,
    "I mean, art is not supposed to change the world, to change practical things, but to change the perceptions.": 1,
    "Art can change the way we see the world.": 1,
    "Art can create an energy.": 1,
    " Actually, the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions, and then enables it to change the world.": 1,
    " When I do my work, I have two kinds of reaction.": 1,
    "People say, oh, why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan?": 1,
    "They would be really useful.": 1,
    "Or how can we help?": 1,
    " I presume that you belong to the second category.": 1,
    "And that's good because for that project, I'm going to ask you to take the photos and to paste them.": 1,
    " So now my wish is...": 1,
    " I wish for you to stand up for what you care about.": 1,
    " by participating in a global art project.": 1,
    "And together, we turn the world inside out.": 1,
    "And this starts right now.": 1,
    "Yes, everyone in the room.": 1,
    "Everyone watching.": 1,
    " I wanted that wish to actually start now.": 1,
    "So a subject you're passionate about, a person you want to tell the story, or even your own photo, tell me what you stand for.": 1,
    "Take the photo, the portraits.": 1,
    " upload it, I'll give you all the details, and I'll send you back your poster.": 1,
    "Join by groups and reveal things to the world.": 1,
    " There's full details on the website inside that project.net that is launching today.": 1,
    "What we see changes who we are.": 1,
    "When we act together, the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts.": 1,
    " So I hope that together we'll create something that the world will remember.": 1,
    "And this starts right now and depends on you.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
