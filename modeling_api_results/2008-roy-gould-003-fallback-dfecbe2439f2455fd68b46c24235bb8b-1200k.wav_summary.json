    " Less than a year from now, the world is going to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy which marks the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope.": 1,
    " In a few months, the world is also going to celebrate the launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research, which I think is going to have as profound an impact on the way we view the universe as Galileo did four centuries ago.": 1,
    " It's called the Worldwide Telescope.": 1,
    "And I want to thank TED and Microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention.": 1,
    "And I want to urge you, when you get a chance, to give it a closer look at the TED Lab downstairs.": 1,
    " the World Wide Telescope": 1,
    " takes the best images from the world's greatest telescopes on Earth and in space and has woven them seamlessly": 1,
    " to produce a holistic view of the universe.": 1,
    " It's going to change the way we do astronomy.": 1,
    "It's going to change the way we teach astronomy.": 1,
    "And I think most importantly, it's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe.": 1,
    " If we were having this TED meeting in our grandparents' day, that might not be so big a claim.": 1,
    " In 1920, for example, you weren't allowed to drink.": 1,
    "If you were a woman, you weren't allowed to vote.": 1,
    "And if you looked up at the stars in the Milky Way on a summer night, what you saw": 1,
    " was thought to be the entire universe.": 1,
    "In fact, the head of Harvard's observatory back then gave a great debate in which he argued that the Milky Way galaxy was the entire universe.": 1,
    "Harvard was wrong big time.": 1,
    " Of course, we know today that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy.": 1,
    "We can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe, all the way back in time, almost to the moment of the Big Bang itself.": 1,
    " we can see across the entire spectrum of light, revealing worlds that had previously been invisible.": 1,
    " We see these magnificent star nurseries where nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers and just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise.": 1,
    " We see alien worlds, we see alien solar systems, 300 now and still counting, and they're not like us.": 1,
    " We see black holes at the heart of our galaxy in the Milky Way and elsewhere in the universe where time itself seems to stand still.": 1,
    " But until now, our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented, and I think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us have fallen through the cracks.": 1,
    "And that's changing.": 1,
    " I want to just briefly mention three reasons why my colleagues and I in astronomy and in education are so excited about the World Wide Telescope and why we think it's truly transformative.": 1,
    " First, it enables you to experience the universe.": 1,
    "The World Wide Telescope for me is a kind of magic carpet that lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go.": 1,
    "Second,": 1,
    " You can tour the universe with astronomers as your guides.": 1,
    "And I'm not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you're seeing, but really": 1,
    " people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe, who can share their enthusiasm and can make the universe a welcoming place.": 1,
    " And third, you can create your own tours, you can share them with friends, you can create them with friends.": 1,
    "And that's the part that I think I'm most excited about, because I think that at heart we are all storytellers.": 1,
    "And in telling stories,": 1,
    " Each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way.": 1,
    "We're going to have a personal universe.": 1,
    "I think we're going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge.": 1,
    " Before I introduce the person responsible for the World Wide Telescope, I just want to leave you with this brief thought.": 1,
    "When I ask people, how does the night sky make you feel, they often say, oh, tiny.": 1,
    "I feel tiny and insignificant.": 1,
    " Well, our gaze fills the universe.": 1,
    "And thanks to the creators of the World Wide Telescope,": 1,
    " we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe.": 1,
    "I think the World Wide Telescope will convince you that we may be tiny, but we are truly, wonderfully significant.": 1,
    " I can't tell you what a privilege it is to introduce Curtis Wong from Microsoft.": 1,
    "Thank you all.": 1,
    " So what you're seeing here is a wonderful presentation, but it's one of the tours.": 1,
    "And essentially, this tour was one that was created earlier.": 1,
    "And the tours are all totally interactive, so that if I were to go somewhere, you may be watching a tour, and you can pause anywhere along the way.": 1,
    " You know, pull up other information.": 1,
    "There are lots of web and information sources about places you might want to go.": 1,
    "You can zoom in.": 1,
    "You can pull back out.": 1,
    "The whole resources are there available for you.": 1,
    " So Microsoft, this is a project that, you know, World Wide Telescope is dedicated to Jim Gray, who's our colleague, and a lot of his work that he did is really what makes this project possible.": 1,
    " It's a labor of love for us and our small team and we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe.": 1,
    "Basically kids of all ages like us.": 1,
    "And so World Wide Telescope will be available this spring.": 1,
    " It'll be a free download, thank you Craig Mundy, and it'll be available at the website WorldwideTelescope.org, which is something new.": 1,
    " What you've seen today is less than a fraction of 1% of what is in here.": 1,
    "And in the TED Lab, we have two of those created by a six-year-old named Benjamin that will knock your socks off.": 1,
    "So we'll see you there.": 1
