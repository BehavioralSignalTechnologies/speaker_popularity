    "It's well said.": 2,
    " Many of the tests are conducted while Eve is strapped into the wing because Eve's body is an integral part of the aircraft.": 1,
    " The wing has no steering controls, no flaps, no rudder.": 1,
    "Eve uses his body to steer the wing.": 1,
    " Well, he turns by just putting his head on the one or the other side, and sometimes he assists that with his hand, sometimes even with the leg.": 1,
    "He's acting as a human fuselage, so to say, and that's quite unique.": 1,
    " When he arches his back, he gains altitude.": 1,
    " When he pushes his shoulders forward, he goes into a dive.": 1,
    " There he goes.": 1,
    "There's Yves Wassi.": 1,
    " And I think the wing is open.": 1,
    "The wing is open.": 1,
    "So our first critical moment, it's open.": 1,
    "He is down.": 1,
    "Is he flying?": 1,
    " It looks like he's stabilized.": 1,
    "He's starting to make his climb.": 1,
    "There's that 90 degree turn you're talking about, taking him out.": 1,
    "He's out over the channel.": 1,
    " There is Yves Wassi.": 1,
    "There is no turning back now.": 1,
    "He is over the English Channel and underway.": 1,
    "Ladies and gentlemen, a historic flight has begun.": 1,
    " and what he's gonna do as he approaches the ground is pull down on those toggles to flare, slow himself down just a little bit, and then come in for a nice landing.": 1,
    " There he is.": 1,
    "Yves Wasee has landed in England.": 1,
    " And now it's in adding borrow.": 1,
    "If received.": 1,
    " And this equipment as well.": 1,
    "Yves, welcome.": 1,
    "This is quite amazing.": 1,
    "Those sequences were shot over the last three years in various moments of your activities.": 1,
    "There were many, many others.": 1,
    "So it's possible to fly almost like a bird.": 1,
    "What's this to be up there?": 1,
    " it's fun": 1,
    " I don't have feathers, but I feel like a bird sometimes.": 1,
    "It's really an unreal feeling because normally you have big things.": 1,
    " a plane around you, and when I strap just this little harness, this little wing, I have really the feeling to be a bird.": 1,
    "How did you start to become Jetman?": 1,
    " It was about 20 years ago when I did discover free falling.": 1,
    "When you go out of an airplane, you are almost naked, you take a position like that, and especially when you take a tracking position,": 1,
    " You have the feeling that you are flying.": 1,
    "And that's the nearest thing to the dream.": 1,
    "You have no machine around you.": 1,
    "You are just in the element.": 1,
    "It's very short.": 1,
    " and only in one direction.": 1,
    "So the idea was, okay, keep that feeling of freedom, but change the vector and increase the time.": 1,
    "What's your top speed?": 1,
    " It's about 300 kilometers per hour before a looping.": 1,
    "That means about 190 miles per hour.": 1,
    "And what's the weight of the equipment you're carrying?": 1,
    " When I exit full of kerosene, I'm about 55 kilos, I have 55 kilos on my back.": 1,
    " And you're not piloting.": 1,
    "There is no handle, no steering, nothing.": 1,
    "It's purely your body and the wings become part of the body, or vice versa.": 1,
    " That's really the goal because if you put steering, then you reinvent the airplane and I wanted to keep this freedom.": 1,
    " of movement and it's really like the kid playing to the airplane.": 1,
    "I want to go down like that and up I climb, I turn.": 1,
    "It's really pure flying.": 1,
    "It's not steering, it's flight.": 1,
    " What kind of training do you do personally for that?": 1,
    " Actually, I try to stay just fit.": 1,
    "I don't do a special physical training.": 1,
    " to keep my mobility through new activities, you know, so that I, for example, last winter I did begin with kite surfing, so new things, so you have to adapt.": 1,
    " Because this is, I'm quite an experienced manager of systems as pilot.": 1,
    "But this is really, you need 3DT, you need to be agile and also to adapt very fast.": 1,
    " Somebody in the audience asked me how does he breathe up there because you're going fast and you're up at 3,000 meters or so.": 1,
    " Okay, up to 3000 meters, it's not such a big problem with oxygen, but as you are, for example, bikers, they have the same speed.": 1,
    "Just with the helmet, it's integral helmet, it's really no problem to breath.": 1,
    " Describe for me the equipment, since we have it here.": 1,
    "Two meters span, auto-stable profile, four little engines, 22 kilos trust each, turbines with": 1,
    " working with kerosene, harness.": 1,
    " Parachute, my only instruments are altimeter and time.": 1,
    "I know I have about eight minutes fuel, so just check before it's finished.": 1,
    " Yeah, that's all.": 1,
    "Two parachute, that means if I have a problem with the first one I pull, I still have the possibility to open the second one.": 1,
    " And this is my life.": 1,
    "That's the real important thing about safety.": 1,
    "I did use that during these last 15 years about 20 times.": 1,
    " never with that type of wing but at the beginning I can release": 1,
    " my wing when I am in a spin.": 1,
    "We saw the 2009 crossing of the Gibraltar Strait where you lost control and then you dive down into the clouds and in the ocean.": 1,
    " So that was one of those cases where you left the wings go, right?": 1,
    "Yeah, I did try in clouds, but you lose completely orientation.": 1,
    "So I did try to take again a climb.": 1,
    " attitude I thought okay I will go out but most probably I did something like that the next thing something that is not very safe in image but you don't you feel great but you have not": 1,
    " You have not the right attitude.": 1,
    "So the next thing I saw was just blue, it was the sea.": 1,
    "I have also audible altimeter, so I was at my minimum altitude.": 1,
    " In that vector, fast, so pull that.": 1,
    "And then I did open my parachute.": 1,
    " Exactly.": 1,
    "There is a rescue parachute for the wing for two reasons.": 1,
    "So I can repair afterwards and especially that nobody take that.": 1,
    " This is risky stuff indeed, right?": 1,
    "People have died trying to do this kind of things and you don't look like a crazy guy, you're a Swiss airline pilot, so you're rather a checklist kind of guy.": 1,
    " I assume you have standards?": 1,
    "Yeah, I have no checklist for that.": 1,
    "Okay, let's not tell your employer.": 1,
    " No, that's really two worlds.": 1,
    "Civil aviation is something that we know very well.": 1,
    "We have 100 years of experience.": 1,
    " and you can adapt really precisely.": 1,
    "With that, I have adapted to something new that means improvise.": 1,
    " So it's really a play between these two approaches, something that I know very well.": 1,
    "These principles, for example, we have two engines on an Airbus.": 1,
    " with only one engine, you can fly.": 1,
    "So plan B, always plan B in a fighter, you have an ejection seat.": 1,
    "That's my ejection seat.": 1,
    "So I have the approach of a professional pilot with": 1,
    " the respect of a pioneer in front of Mother Nature.": 1,
    "What happens if one of the engines stops?": 1,
    " I do a roll and then I stabilize and according to my altitude I continue on two or three engines, it's sometimes possible.": 1,
    " according, it's quite complicated to explain, but according at which regime I was, I can continue in two.": 1,
    " and try to get a nice place to land and then I open my parachute.": 1,
    "So the beginning of the flight is actually you jump off a plane or a helicopter and you go on a dive and you accelerate the engines and then you basically take off mid-air somewhere.": 1,
    " And then the landing as we have seen arriving on this side of the channel is through a parachute.": 1,
    "So just as a curiosity, where did you land when you flew over the Grand Canyon?": 1,
    " Did you land on the rim down at the bottom?": 1,
    "Yeah, it was down on the bottom and I came back afterwards on the sled of the helicopter back.": 1,
    "But it was too stony and full of cactus on top.": 1,
    " That's exactly why I asked the question.": 1,
    "And also the currents are quite funny there.": 1,
    "There is a big thermal activity, big difference in altitude also, so it was much safer for me to land.": 1,
    " at the bottom.": 1,
    "So I feel right now many people in the audience are asking, okay, when are you developing a double seater so they can fly with you?": 1,
    "I have a standard answer.": 1,
    "Have you ever seen tandem birds?": 1,
    " Perfect answer.": 1,
    " Yves, one last question.": 1,
    "What's next for you?": 1,
    "What's next for Jetman?": 1,
    "First to instruct a younger guy.": 1,
    "I want to share it, to do formation flights.": 1,
    " I plan to start from a cliff, like catapulted from a cliff.": 1,
    "So instead of jumping on a plane, yes?": 1,
    "Yes, with the final goal to take off, but with initial speed.": 1,
    " Really, I go step by step.": 1,
    "It seems a little bit crazy, but it's not.": 1,
    "It's possible to start already now.": 1,
    "It's just too dangerous.": 1,
    " Thanks, the increase of the technology, better technology, it will be safe.": 1,
    "And I hope it will be for everybody.": 1,
    "Yves, thank you very much.": 1,
