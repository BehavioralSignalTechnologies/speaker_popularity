    "Okay.": 3,
    "I lied!": 2,
    "I did a terrible thing!": 2,
    " So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl, if you say a word often enough, it becomes you.": 1,
    "And having grown up in a segregated city, Baltimore, Maryland, I sort of used that idea to go around America with a tape recorder.": 1,
    "Thank God for technology.": 1,
    " to interview people thinking that if I walked in their words, which is also why I don't wear shoes when I perform, if I walked in their words that I could sort of absorb America, I was also inspired by Walt Whitman who wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him.": 1,
    " These four characters are going to be from that work that I've been doing for many years now and well over, I don't know, a couple thousand people I've interviewed.": 1,
    "Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel?": 1,
    " that old radio man.": 1,
    "So I thought he would be the perfect person to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history.": 1,
    "You know, he was born": 1,
    " Born in 1912, the year the Titanic sank, greatest ship ever built, hits the tip of an iceberg, and bam, it went down, it went down, and I came up.": 1,
    "Well, some century.": 1,
    " So this is his answer about a defining moment in American history.": 1,
    " Defining moment in American history.": 1,
    "I don't think there's one.": 1,
    "You can't say Hiroshima.": 1,
    "That's a big moment.": 1,
    "I can't think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment.": 1,
    "The gradual slippage.": 1,
    " Slippage is the word used by the people in Watergate.": 1,
    "Moral slippage.": 1,
    "It's a gradual kind of thing, combination of things.": 1,
    "You see, we also have the technology.": 1,
    "I say less and less the human touch.": 1,
    "Oh, let me tell you a funny little play on it.": 1,
    " The Atlanta airport is a modern airport.": 1,
    "And as you leave the gate, there are these trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination.": 1,
    "And these trains are smooth and they're quiet.": 1,
    " And they're efficient.": 1,
    "And there's a voice on the train.": 1,
    "You know, the voice was a human voice.": 1,
    "You see, in the old days, we had robots.": 1,
    "Robots imitated humans.": 1,
    "Now, we have robots.": 1,
    " Humans imitating robots.": 1,
    "So we got this voice on this train.": 1,
    "Can course one, Omaha, Lincoln.": 1,
    "Can course two, Dallas, Fort Worth.": 1,
    "Same voice, just as the train is about to go.": 1,
    " A young couple rush in, and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors.": 1,
    "And that voice, without losing a beat, says, because of late entry, we're delayed 30 seconds.": 1,
    " Just then, everybody's looking at this couple with hateful eyes, and the couple's going like this, you know, shrinking.": 1,
    "Well, I'd happen to have a couple of drinks.": 1,
    " Before boarding, I do that to steal my nerves and soul.": 1,
    "I imitate a train call, holding my hand on my, George Orwell, your time has come.": 1,
    " You see?": 1,
    "Well, some of you are laughing.": 1,
    "Everybody laughs when I say that, but not on this train.": 1,
    "Silence.": 1,
    "And so suddenly, they're looking at me.": 1,
    "So here I am with a couple, the three of us, shrinking at the foot of Calvary, about to be up, you know.": 1,
    " Just then, I see a baby, a little baby in the lap of a mother.": 1,
    "I know it's Hispanic because she's speaking Spanish to her companion.": 1,
    " So I'm going to talk to the baby.": 1,
    "So I say to the baby, holding my hand over my mouth, because my breath must be 100.": 1,
    "Proof!": 1,
    " I say to the baby, sir or madam, what is your considered opinion of the human species?": 1,
    " And her baby looks you all the way, babies look at you clearly, starts laughing, starts busting out with this crazy little laugh.": 1,
    "I said, thank God for a human reaction we haven't lost yet.": 1,
    " But you see, the human touch, you see, is disappearing.": 1,
    "You know, you see, you've got to question the official truth.": 1,
    "You know, the thing that was so great about Mark Twain, you know, we honor Mark Twain, but we don't read him.": 1,
    " We read Huck Finn, of course.": 1,
    "We read Huck Finn, of course.": 1,
    "I mean, Huck, of course, was tremendous.": 1,
    "Remember that great scene on the raft?": 1,
    "Remember what Huck did?": 1,
    "You see, here's Huck.": 1,
    "He's a little kid.": 1,
    "He's had no schooling, but there's something in him.": 1,
    " And the official truth, the truth was, the law was, that a black man was a property was a thing, you see.": 1,
    "And Huck is on the raft.": 1,
    " with a property named Jim, a slave seat.": 1,
    "And he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids and steal them from the woman who owns them.": 1,
    "And Hex says, oh my gosh, that woman, that woman never did me any harm.": 1,
    " Oh, he's going to steal, he's going to steal, going to do a terrible thing.": 1,
    "Just then, two slavers caught up, guys chasing slaves looking for a gym.": 1,
    "Anybody up on that raft with you?": 1,
    " Yeah?": 1,
    " Is he black or white?": 1,
    " White!": 1,
    "And they go off!": 1,
    "And Alex says, Oh my God!": 1,
    "Oh my God!": 1,
    "Why do I feel so good?": 1,
    " But you see, the goodness of Huck, that stuff that Huck's been made of, you see, all been buried, it's all been buried.": 1,
    "So the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.": 1,
    "So you ask about a defining moment, ain't no defining moment in American history for me.": 1,
    "It's an accretion of moments that add up.": 1,
    " to where we are now, where trivia becomes news, and more and more, less and less awareness of the pain of the other.": 1,
    " I don't know if you could use this or not, but I was quoting Wright Morris, writer from Nebraska, who says, we're more and more into communications and less and less into communication.": 1,
    " Okay, kids, I gotta scram.": 1,
    "Gotta go see my cardiologist.": 1,
    "And that studs Turkle.": 1,
    " So...": 1,
    " talk about risk-taking.": 1,
    "I'm going to do somebody that nobody likes.": 1,
    "You know, most actors want to do characters that are likeable and": 1,
    " Well, not always, but the notion, especially at a conference like this, I like to inspire people.": 1,
    "But since this was called risk-taking, I'm doing somebody who I never do because she's so unlikable that one person actually came backstage and told me to take her out of the show she was in.": 1,
    " And I'm doing her because I think we think of risk at a conference like this as a good thing.": 1,
    "But there's certain other connotations to the word risk.": 1,
    "And the same thing about the word nature.": 1,
    "What is nature?": 1,
    " Maxine Green, who's a wonderful philosopher, who's his oldest studs, and was the head of a philosophy, great big philosophy kind of organization,": 1,
    " I went to her and asked her what are the two things that she doesn't know that she still wants to know.": 1,
    "And she said, well, personally, I still feel like I have to curtsy when I see the president of my university.": 1,
    " And I still feel as though I've got to get coffee for my male colleagues, even though I've outlived most of them.": 1,
    "And she said, and then intellectually, I don't know enough about the negative imagination, and September 11th certainly taught us that that's a whole area we don't investigate.": 1,
    " This piece is about a negative imagination.": 1,
    "It raises questions about what nature is, what mother nature is, and about what a risk can be.": 1,
    "And I got this": 1,
    " in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women, everything I do is word for word off of a tape and I title things because I think people speak in organic poems and this is called A Mirror to Her Mouth and this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins.": 1,
    " I began to learn how to cover it up.": 1,
    " Because I didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home.": 1,
    "I want everybody to think we were a normal family.": 1,
    "I mean, we had all the materialistic things.": 1,
    "But that didn't make my children pain any less.": 1,
    " that didn't make their fears subside.": 1,
    " I ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes and busted lips and bruises.": 1,
    "I didn't handle more excuses.": 1,
    "And he beat me too.": 1,
    "But that didn't change the fact that it was a nightmare for my family.": 1,
    "It was a nightmare.": 1,
    " And I failed them dramatically because I allowed it to go on and on and on.": 1,
    "But the night that Maisha got killed and the intensity just grew and grew and grew until one night we came home.": 1,
    " from getting drugs.": 1,
    "And he got angry with Maisha and he started beating her and he put her in a bathtub.": 1,
    " Oh, he would use a belt.": 1,
    "He had a belt because he had this war perverted thing that Maisha was having sex with her little brother and they was fondling each other.": 1,
    "That would be his reason.": 1,
    "I'm just talking about the particular night that she died.": 1,
    " And so he put her in the bathtub.": 1,
    "And I was in the bedroom with the baby.": 1,
    "And four months before this happened, four months before Maisha died, I thought I could really fix this man.": 1,
    "So I had a baby by him, insane.": 1,
    " thinking if I gave him his own kid, he would leave mine alone.": 1,
    "And it didn't work.": 1,
    "Didn't work.": 1,
    "And I ended up with three children, Houston, Maisha, and Dominic, who was four months old when I came to jail.": 1,
    " And I was in the bedroom, like I said, he had her in the bathroom.": 1,
    "And every time he hit her, she would fall.": 1,
    " and she would hit her head on the top.": 1,
    " It happened continuously, repeatedly.": 1,
    "I could hear it.": 1,
    " But I dared not to move.": 1,
    "I didn't move.": 1,
    "I didn't even go and see what was happening.": 1,
    "I just sat there and listened.": 1,
    " And then he put her in a hallway.": 1,
    " It all just sat there.": 1,
    " And so she sat there for about four or five hours.": 1,
    " And then he told her, get up.": 1,
    " And when she got up, she said she couldn't see.": 1,
    " Her face was bruised.": 1,
    "She had a black eye.": 1,
    "All around her head was just swollen.": 1,
    "Her head was about two sizes of its own size.": 1,
    " I told them let her go to sleep.": 1,
    " He let her go to sleep.": 1,
    " The next morning she was dead.": 1,
    " He went in to check on her for school, and he got very excited.": 1,
    "He said, she won't breathe.": 1,
    " I knew immediately that she was dead.": 1,
    "I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead, so I went and I put a mirror to her mouth.": 1,
    "There was no thing, nothing.": 1,
    " coming out of her mouth.": 1,
    "He said, he said, he said, we can't find, we can't let nobody find out about this.": 1,
    "He said, you gotta help me.": 1,
    "I agree, I agree.": 1,
    " I mean, I've been keeping a secret for years and years and years, so it just seemed like second hand to me just to keep on keeping it a secret.": 1,
    " So we went to the mall and we told the police that we had like lost her, that she was missing.": 1,
    " We told the security guard.": 1,
    " that she was missing.": 1,
    " But she wasn't missing.": 1,
    " And we told the security guard what we had put on her.": 1,
    "We went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing that we had told the security guard that we had put on her.": 1,
    " And then we got the baby and my other child and we drove out to like I-95.": 1,
    " I was so petrified and so numb, all I could look.": 1,
    " was in a rear view mirror.": 1,
    " And he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway.": 1,
    " M\u00e3o, tchau!": 1,
    " I let that happen too.": 1,
    " So that's an investigation of the negative imagination.": 1,
    " Most of my work, when I started this project called On the Road to Search for American Character with my tape recorder, I thought that I was going to go around America and find it in all its aspects, bull riders, cowboys.": 1,
    " pig farmers, drum majorettes, but I sort of got tripped on race relations because my first big show was a show about a race riot.": 1,
    " And so I went to both two race riots.": 1,
    "One of them was the Los Angeles riot.": 1,
    "And this next piece is from that because this is what I would say I've learned the most about race relations from this piece.": 1,
    " It's a kind of an aria, I would say, in the many tapes that I have.": 1,
    "Everybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happened because four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King who was captured on videotape technology.": 1,
    " It was played all over the world.": 1,
    "Everybody thought the four cops would go to jail.": 1,
    "They did not, so there were riots.": 1,
    "And what a lot of people forget is there was a second trial ordered by George Bush Sr.": 1,
    " That trial came back with two cops going to jail and two cops declared innocent.": 1,
    "I was at that trial and I mean people just danced in the streets because they were afraid it was going to be another riot.": 1,
    "This explosion of joy that this verdict could come back this way.": 1,
    " So there was a community that didn't, the Korean Americans, whose stores had been burned to the ground.": 1,
    "And so this woman, Mrs. Young Sun Han, I suppose, will have taught me the most that I have learned about race, and she asks also a question": 1,
    " that Studs talks about this notion of the official truth, to question the official truth.": 1,
    "So what she's questioning here, she's taking a chance and questioning what justice is in society, and this is called Swallowing the Bitterness.": 1,
    " I used to believe America was the best.": 1,
    "I watched in Korea.": 1,
    " many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie.": 1,
    "I never saw any poor man, any black.": 1,
    " Until 1992, I used to believe America was the best.": 1,
    "I still do.": 1,
    "I don't deny that because I am a victim.": 1,
    " But at the end of 92, when we were in such turmoil and having all the financial problems and all the mental problems, I began to really realize": 1,
    " that Koreans are completely left out of this society and we are nothing.": 1,
    " Why?": 1,
    "Why do we have to be left out?": 1,
    "We didn't qualify for medical treatment, no food stamp, no GI.": 1,
    " No car, no welfare, anything.": 1,
    "Many African Americans who never work got minimum amount of money to survive.": 1,
    "We didn't get any because we have a car.": 1,
    " We'll be right back.": 1,
    " and a house.": 1,
    "And we are high tax payers.": 1,
    " Where do I find the justice?": 1,
    " Okay?": 1,
    "Many African Americans probably think they won by the trial.": 1,
    "I was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict and all the day they were having a party.": 1,
    " They said everything, all of South Central, all the churches.": 1,
    "And they said, well, finally justice has been done and this is society.": 1,
    " Well, what about victims' rights?": 1,
    "They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants.": 1,
    " They have a lot of respect as I do for Dr. Martin King.": 1,
    " He is the only model for black community.": 1,
    "I don't care just Jackson.": 1,
    " He is the model of nonviolence, nonviolence.": 1,
    "And they would all like to be in his spirit.": 1,
    "But what about 1992?": 1,
    " They destroyed innocent people.": 1,
    " And I wonder if that is really justice for them to get their rights in that way.": 1,
    " I was swallowing the bitterness, sitting here alone and watching them.": 1,
    "They became so hilarious.": 1,
    " But I was happy for them.": 1,
    "I was glad for them.": 1,
    "At least they got something back okay.": 1,
    " Let's just forget about Korean victims and other victims who were destroyed by them.": 1,
    " They fought for their rights.": 1,
    " For over two centuries, and maybe because they sacrificed other minorities, Hispanic, Asian, we would suffer more.": 1,
    " in the mainstream, that's why I understand, that's why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict, but I wish that...": 1,
    " I wish that I could be part of the enjoyment.": 1,
    "I wish that I could live together with black people.": 1,
    " But after the riot, it's too much difference.": 1,
    " The fire is still there.": 1,
    "How do you say it?": 1,
    "Igniting, igniting, igniting fire, igniting fire.": 1,
    " It's still there.": 1,
    "It can burst out anytime.": 1,
    " Mrs. Young-Sun Han.": 1,
    " The other reason that I don't wear shoes is just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up and get into the feet of somebody walking really in somebody else's shoes.": 1,
    " And I told you that in, you know, I didn't give you the year, but in 79, I thought that I was gonna go around and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that, and I got sidetracked on race relations.": 1,
    "Finally, I did find a bull rider two years ago.": 1,
    " And I've been going to the rodeos with him, and we've bonded.": 1,
    "And he's the lead in an op-ed I did about the Republican convention.": 1,
    "He's a Republican.": 1,
    "I won't say anything about my party affiliation, but...": 1,
    " Anyway, so this is my dear, dear Brent Williams and this is on toughness in case anybody needs to know about being tough for the work that you do.": 1,
    "I think there's a real lesson in this and this is called toughness.": 1,
    " Oh.": 1,
    " Well, I'm an optimist.": 1,
    "I mean, basically, I'm an optimist.": 1,
    "I mean, you know, I mean, it's like my wife, Jolie, and her family's always saying, you know, you ever think he's just a born loser?": 1,
    "Seems like he has so much bad luck, you know, but then,": 1,
    " When that bull stepped on my kidney, you know, I didn't lose my kidney.": 1,
    "I could have lost my kidney.": 1,
    "I kept my kidney.": 1,
    "So I don't think I'm a born loser.": 1,
    "I think that's good luck.": 1,
    " And I mean funny things like this happen.": 1,
    "I was in the, I was in the doctor's office last Cascade and there was a Reader's Digest October 2002.": 1,
    "It was like seven ways to get lucky.": 1,
    "And it says if you want to get lucky, you know, you got to be around positive people.": 1,
    " And I mean like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here and talk to me She's like she's just talking she's just being nice to you.": 1,
    "She's not gonna do that": 1,
    " And then you called me up and you said you want to come out here and interview me.": 1,
    "And she went and looked you up on the internet.": 1,
    "She said look who she is.": 1,
    "You're not even going to be able to answer her questions.": 1,
    " And she was saying, you're going to make me look like an idiot because I've never been to college and I wouldn't be talking professional anything.": 1,
    "I said, well, look, the woman talked to me four hours.": 1,
    "If I wasn't talking and she wanted me to talk, I don't think she would even come out here.": 1,
    " confidence?": 1,
    "Well I think I ride more out of uh out of determination than confidence.": 1,
    "I mean confidence is like you know you've been on that bull before you know you can ride him.": 1,
    "I mean confidence is kind of like being cocky but in a good way.": 1,
    " But determination, you know, that's like just, you know, fuck the form, get the horn.": 1,
    " That's tough heatin' in the movie Eight Seconds.": 1,
    "I mean, like, Pat O'Mealy always said when I was a boy, he'd say, you know, you got more tried than any kid ever seen, and trying to termination's the same thing.": 1,
    "Termination's like you're gonna hang on that bull even if you're ridin' upside down.": 1,
    "Termination's like you're gonna ride": 1,
    " till your head hits the back of the dirt.": 1,
    " freedom, we'll have to beat a rodeo.": 1,
    " Beauty.": 1,
    " I don't think I know what beauty is.": 1,
    "Well, you know, I guess I have to be the rodeo, too.": 1,
    "I mean, look how we are, the ruffy family, piling around, shaking hands, resting around me.": 1,
    "It's like, you know, racking up all kinds.": 1,
    " Our credit cards are on entry fees and gas.": 1,
    "We ride together.": 1,
    "We eat together.": 1,
    "We sleep together.": 1,
    "I mean, I can't even imagine what it's going to be like the last day I rode here.": 1,
    "I mean, I'll be all right.": 1,
    " I mean, I have them ranch and everything, but I just didn't even want to think about the day that comes.": 1,
    "I mean, I guess it'd just be like the day my brother died.": 1,
    " Toughness?": 1,
    " Well, we was in West Jordan, Utah, and this bull shoved my face right through the metal chutes.": 1,
    "And I busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital.": 1,
    "And they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out.": 1,
    "And I had to go and ride in a rodeo that night, so I didn't want them to put me under anesthesia.": 1,
    " These are whatever you call it.": 1,
    "And so they sewed my face up and then they had straightened out my nose and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose and": 1,
    " went up through my brains and felt like it was coming out the top of my head and everybody said that it should have killed me but it didn't because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain.": 1,
    " But the good thing was, once they shoved those rods up there and straightened my nose out, I could breathe.": 1,
    "And I haven't been able to breathe since I broke my nose in the high school rodeo.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " my way up.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
