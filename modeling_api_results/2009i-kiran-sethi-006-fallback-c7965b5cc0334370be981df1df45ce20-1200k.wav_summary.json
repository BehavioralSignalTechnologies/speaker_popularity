    " Contagious is a good word.": 1,
    "Even in the times of H1N1, I like the word.": 1,
    " Laughter is contagious, passion is contagious, inspiration is contagious.": 1,
    "We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers.": 1,
    " But for me, what was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something I call the I can bug.": 1,
    " So the question is, why only them?": 1,
    "In a country of a billion people and some, why so few?": 1,
    "Is it luck?": 1,
    "Is it chance?": 1,
    "Can we all not systematically and consciously get infected?": 1,
    " So in the next eight minutes, I would like to share with you my story.": 1,
    "I got infected when I was 17, when as a student of the design college, I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas, challenged me, and had lots of cups of chai with me.": 1,
    " And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt and how contagious that feeling was.": 1,
    "I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.": 1,
    " So when I started Riverside School 10 years ago, it became a lab.": 1,
    "A lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the eye-can bug.": 1,
    " And I uncovered that if learning is embedded in real world context, that is if you blur the boundaries between school and life, then children go through a journey of aware, where they can see the change.": 1,
    " Enable, be changed, and then empower.": 1,
    "Lead the change.": 1,
    "And that directly increased student well-being.": 1,
    "Children became more competent and less helpless.": 1,
    " But this is all common sense.": 1,
    "So I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at Riverside.": 1,
    "A little background.": 1,
    "When my grade five was learning about child rights, they were made to roll incense sticks, agarbattis, for eight hours": 1,
    " to experience what it means to be a child laborer.": 1,
    "They transform them.": 1,
    "What you will see is their journey and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world.": 1,
    " that's them rolling and in two hours after their backs broke they were changed and once that happened": 1,
    " They were out in the city convincing everybody that child labour just had to be abolished.": 1,
    " And look at Raghav, that moment when his face changes because he's been able to understand that he has shifted that man's mindset.": 1,
    " That can happen in a classroom.": 1,
    " So when Raghav experienced that, he went from teacher told me to I am doing it.": 1,
    "And that's the I can mind shift.": 1,
    "And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured.": 1,
    " But we had parents who said, OK, making our children good human beings is all very well, but what about math and science and English?": 1,
    "Show us the grades.": 1,
    "And we did.": 1,
    "The data was conclusive.": 1,
    " When children are empowered, not only do they do good, they do well.": 1,
    "In fact, very well.": 1,
    " As you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over 2000 schools in India, Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India in math, English and science.": 1,
    " So it worked.": 1,
    "It was now time to take it outside Riverside.": 1,
    "So on August 15th, Independence Day 2007, the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad.": 1,
    " Now it was not about Riverside School.": 1,
    "It was about all children.": 1,
    "So we were shameless.": 1,
    "We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police, the press.": 1,
    " businesses and basically said when are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resides in every child?": 1,
    "When will you include the child in the city?": 1,
    " Basically, open your hearts and your minds to the child.": 1,
    "So how did the city respond?": 1,
    "Since 2007, every other month, the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood.": 1,
    " Here was a city telling its child, you can.": 1,
    "A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.": 1,
    " So, the busy streets closed down, we've had the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us and it gets taken over by children.": 1,
    "They are skating, they are doing street plays.": 1,
    " They are playing all free for all children.": 1,
    " Approach is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier and we plan to extend this to other parts of the city.": 1,
    "Let's just give free time.": 1,
    " and Ahmedabad got the first child friendly zebra crossing in the world.": 1,
    "When a city gives to the children, in the future the children will give back to the city.": 1,
    " And because of that, Ahmedabad is known as India's first child-friendly city.": 1,
    " So you're getting the pattern.": 1,
    "First 200 children at Riverside, then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad and growing.": 1,
    "It was time now to infect India.": 1,
    " So on August 15th, again, Independence Day 2009, empowered with the same process, we empowered 100,000 children to say,": 1,
    " I can.": 1,
    "How?": 1,
    "We designed a simple toolkit, converted into eight languages, and reached 32,000 schools.": 1,
    " We basically gave children a very simple challenge.": 1,
    "We said, take one idea, anything that bothers you, choose one week, and change a billion lives.": 1,
    " And they did.": 1,
    "Stories of change poured in from all over India, from Nagaland in the east to Jhunjhunu in the west, from Sikkim in the north to Krishnagiri in the south.": 1,
    " children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems, right from loneliness, to filling potholes on the street, to alcoholism, and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages in Rajasthan.": 1,
    " I mean, it was incredible, basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say, you can, then they will.": 1,
    "Infection in India.": 1,
    " This is in Rajasthan, a rural village.": 1,
    "First time, a rally in a street play in a rural school.": 1,
    "Unheard of.": 1,
    " to tell their parents why literacy is important.": 1,
    " And look at what their parents did.": 1,
    " If this program started, it would have been great for us.": 1,
    "If our children hadn't studied, where would we have taught them?": 1,
    "I am very happy that my school children have done this.": 1,
    "From now on, I will not do anything like this.": 1,
    "Nothing will happen to me.": 1,
    "Nothing will happen to my children.": 1,
    " An inner city school in Hyderabad.": 1,
    " It's 581, A, 55.": 1,
    "Let's start with 55.": 1,
    "Girls and boys, aren't I right about going out?": 1,
    "Pretty difficult, but they did it.": 1,
    " I am very happy that these young boys are doing so well.": 1,
    "Today they are cleaning the society, tomorrow they will go to Hyderabad.": 1,
    " Hyderabad will change, India will change.": 1,
    "It was a revelation for me.": 1,
    "It doesn't strike me that they had so much insight here.": 1,
    "Thank you ladies and gentlemen for an option.": 1,
    " We have some wonderful paintings for you, for a very good cause.": 1,
    "The money you give us will be used to buy your paintings.": 1,
    "Are you ready ladies and gentlemen?": 1,
    "Are you ready?": 1,
    " The Charter of Compassion stands right here.": 1,
    "Street plays, auctions, petitions.": 1,
    "I mean, they were changing lives.": 1,
    " It was incredible.": 1,
    "So how can we still stay immune?": 1,
    "How can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement?": 1,
    " I know it's obvious, but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change, Gandhiji.": 1,
    "Seventy years ago, it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of WeCan.": 1,
    " So today, who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in India?": 1,
    " Last I heard the preamble still said, we the people of India, right?": 1,
    "So if not us, then who?": 1,
    "If not now, then when?": 1,
    "Like I said, contagious is a good word.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
