    " has spent the last years trying to resolve two enigmas.": 1,
    "Why is productivity so disappointing": 1,
    " in all the companies where I work for, I have worked with more than 500 companies, despite all the technological advances, computers, IT, communications, telecommunications, the internet.": 1,
    " Enigma number two, why is there so little engagement at work?": 1,
    "Why do people feel so miserable, even actively disengaged?": 1,
    " disengaging their colleagues, acting against the interest of their company.": 1,
    " despite all the affiliation events, the celebration, the people initiatives, the leadership development programs to train managers on how to better motivate their teams.": 1,
    " At the beginning, I thought there was a chicken and egg issue.": 1,
    "Because people are less engaged, they are less productive.": 1,
    "Or vice versa, because they are less productive, we put more pressure and they are less engaged.": 1,
    " But as we are doing our analysis, we realize that there was a common root cause to these two issues that relates in fact to the basic pillars of management.": 1,
    " The way we organize is based on two pillars.": 1,
    "The hard structure process systems, the soft feelings, sentiments, interpersonal relationships.": 1,
    " Traits personality and whenever a company reorganize restructure Re-engineer go through a cultural transformation program.": 1,
    "It uses these two pillars now": 1,
    " We try to refine them, we try to combine them.": 1,
    "The real issue is, and this is the answer to the two enigmas, these pillars are obsolete.": 1,
    " Everything you read in business books is based either on one or the other or their combination.": 1,
    "They are obsolete.": 1,
    "Why does it work?": 1,
    "How do they work when you try to use these approaches in front of the new complexity of business?": 1,
    " The hard approach basically is that you start from strategy, requirements, structure, process, system, KPI, scorecards, committees, headquarters, hubs, clusters, you name it.": 1,
    " I forgot all the metrics, incentives, committees, middle offices and interfaces.": 1,
    "What happens?": 1,
    "Basically, on the left, you have more complexity, the new complexity of business.": 1,
    "We need quality, cost.": 1,
    " Reliability speed and every time there is a new requirement.": 1,
    "We use the same approach We create dedicated structure process systems basically to deal with the new complexity of business": 1,
    " The hard approach creates just complicatedness in the organization.": 1,
    "Let's take an example.": 1,
    "An automotive company.": 1,
    " The engineering division is a five-dimensional matrix.": 1,
    "If you open any cell of the matrix, you find another 20-dimensional matrix.": 1,
    "You have Mr. Noise, Mr. Petrol Consumption, Mr. Anticoagent Properties.": 1,
    " Any new requirement, you have a dedicated function in charge of aligning engineers against the new requirement.": 1,
    "What happens when the new requirement emerges?": 1,
    " Some years ago a new requirement appeared on the marketplace the length of the warranty period So therefore the new requirement is Reparability making cars easy to repair.": 1,
    "Otherwise when you bring the car to the": 1,
    " garage to fix the light if you have to remove the engine to access the lights.": 1,
    "The car will have to stay one week in the garage instead of two hours and warranty budget will explode.": 1,
    "So what was the solution using the hard approach?": 1,
    " If Reparability is a new requirement, the solution is to create a new function, MrReparability.": 1,
    "And MrReparability creates the Reparability process.": 1,
    " with a Reparability Scorecard, with Reparability Metrics and eventually Reparability Incentive that came on top of 25 other KPIs.": 1,
    " What percentage of these people is variable compensation?": 1,
    "20% at most.": 1,
    "Divided by 26 KPIs, reparability makes a difference of 0.8%.": 1,
    " What difference did it make in their actions?": 1,
    "Their choice is to simplify zero.": 1,
    "But what a cost for zero impact, Mr. Reparability, Process, CoreCard, Evaluation, Coordination with the 25 other coordinators to have zero impact.": 1,
    " Now, in front of the new complexity of business, the only solution is not drawing boxes with reporting lines.": 1,
    "It is basically the interplay, how the parts work together, the connections.": 1,
    " the interactions, the synapses.": 1,
    "It is not the skeleton of boxes, it is the nervous system of adaptiveness and intelligence.": 1,
    " You know, you could call it cooperation, basically.": 1,
    "Whenever people cooperate, they use less resources.": 1,
    "In everything.": 1,
    "You know, the reparability issue is a cooperation problem.": 1,
    " When you design cars, please take into account the needs of those who will repair the cars in the after sales garages.": 1,
    " When we don't cooperate, we need more time, more equipment, more systems, more teams.": 1,
    " When procurement, supply chain, manufacturing don't cooperate, we need more stock, more inventories, more working capital.": 1,
    "Who will pay for that?": 1,
    "Shareholders?": 1,
    "Customers?": 1,
    "No, they will refuse.": 1,
    "So who is left?": 1,
    " the employee who have to compensate through their super individual efforts for the lack of cooperation, stress, burnout, their overwhelmed accidents.": 1,
    "No wonder they disengage.": 1,
    " How do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation?": 1,
    " the hard.": 1,
    "In banks, when there is a problem between the back office and the front office, they don't cooperate.": 1,
    "What is the solution?": 1,
    "They create a middle office.": 1,
    " What happens one year later?": 1,
    "Instead of one problem between the back and the front, now I have two problems.": 1,
    "Between the back and the middle, and between the middle and the front.": 1,
    "Plus I have to pay for the middle office.": 1,
    " The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation.": 1,
    "It can only add new boxes, new bones in the skeleton.": 1,
    " The soft approach to make people cooperate, we need to make them like each other, improve interpersonal feelings.": 1,
    "The more people like each other, the more they will cooperate.": 1,
    "It is totally wrong.": 1,
    " It is even counterproductive.": 1,
    "Look, at home I have two TVs.": 1,
    "Why?": 1,
    "Precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife.": 1,
    " not to have to impose trade-offs to my wife.": 1,
    "And why I try not to impose trade-offs to my wife?": 1,
    "Precisely because I love my wife.": 1,
    " If I didn't love my wife, one TV will be enough.": 1,
    "You will watch my favorite football game.": 1,
    "If you're not happy, here is the book or the door.": 1,
    " The more we like each other, the more we avoid the real cooperation that would strain our relationships by imposing tough trade-offs.": 1,
    "And we go for a second TV or we escalate the decision above for arbitration.": 1,
    " Definitely, these approaches are obsolete.": 1,
    " to deal with complexity, to enhance the nervous system, we have created what we call the smart simplicity approach based on simple rules.": 1,
    "Simple rule number one, understand what others do.": 1,
    " What is their real work?": 1,
    "We need to go beyond the boxes.": 1,
    " the job descriptions beyond the surface of the container to understand the real content.": 1,
    "Me, designer, if I put a wire here, I know that it will mean that you will have to remove the engine to access the lights.": 1,
    " Second, you need to reinforce integrators.": 1,
    "Integrators are not middle offices.": 1,
    "They are managers, existing managers that you reinforce so that they have power and interest to make others cooperate.": 1,
    " How can you reinforce your managers as integrators?": 1,
    "By removing layers.": 1,
    "When there are too many layers, people are too far from the action.": 1,
    "Therefore, they need KPIs, metrics.": 1,
    "They need poor proxies.": 1,
    " for reality.": 1,
    "They don't understand reality, and they add the complicatedness of matrix KPIs.": 1,
    "By removing rules, the bigger we are, the more we need integrators.": 1,
    "Therefore, the less rules we must have to give discretionary": 1,
    " Power to managers.": 1,
    "And we do the opposite.": 1,
    "The bigger we are, the more rules we create, and we end up with the encyclopedia Britannica of rules.": 1,
    "You need to increase the quantity of power so that you can empower everybody to use their judgement.": 1,
    " their intelligence.": 1,
    "You must give more cards to people so that they have the critical mass of cards.": 1,
    " to take the risk to cooperate, to move out of insulation, otherwise they will withdraw, they will disengage.": 1,
    "These rules, they come from game theory and organizational sociology.": 1,
    "You can increase the shadow of the future.": 1,
    " create feedback loops that expose people to the consequences of their actions.": 1,
    "This is what the automotive company did when they saw that Mr. Reparability had no impact.": 1,
    " They said to the design engineers, now in three years, when the new car is launched on the market, you will move to the after-sales network and become in charge of the warranty budget.": 1,
    "And if the warranty budget explodes,": 1,
    " it will explode in your head.": 1,
    " much more powerful than 0.8% variable compensation.": 1,
    " you need also to increase reciprocity.": 1,
    " by removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient.": 1,
    "When you remove these buffers,": 1,
    " You hold me by the nose, I hold you by the ear.": 1,
    "We will cooperate.": 1,
    "Remove the second TV.": 1,
    "There are many second TVs that work.": 1,
    "They don't create value, they just provide.": 1,
    " dysfunctional self-sufficiency.": 1,
    "You need to reward those who cooperate and blame those who don't cooperate.": 1,
    "The CEO of the Lego Group.": 1,
    " J\u00fcrgen Wittner's top has a great way to use it.": 1,
    "He says, blame is not for failure.": 1,
    "It is for failing to help or ask for help.": 1,
    " it changes everything.": 1,
    "Suddenly it becomes in my interest to be transparent on my real weaknesses, my real forecast, because I know I will not be blamed if I fail, but if I fail to help or ask for help.": 1,
    " When you do this, it has a lot of implications on organizational design.": 1,
    " You stop drawing boxes, dotted lines, full lines.": 1,
    "You look at the interplay.": 1,
    "It has a lot of implications on financial policies that we use.": 1,
    " on human resource management practices.": 1,
    "When you do that, you can manage complexity, the new complexity of business without getting complicated.": 1,
    "You create more value.": 1,
    " with lower cost.": 1,
    "You simultaneously improve performance and satisfaction at work because you have removed the common root cause that hinders both, complicatedness.": 1,
    "This is your battle, business leaders.": 1,
    " The real battle is not against competitors.": 1,
    "This is rubbish, very abstract.": 1,
    "When do we meet competitors to fight them?": 1,
    " The real battle is against ourselves, against our bureaucracy, our complicatedness.": 1,
    "Only you can fight, can do it.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
