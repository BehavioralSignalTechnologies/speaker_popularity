    " I was asked by Wilson Art International, a plastic laminate company, which makes the largest plastic laminate company in the world, and they asked me to": 1,
    " design a trade show booth for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York.": 1,
    " in 2000.": 1,
    "So looking at their three main markets for their product, which were basically transportation design, interiors, and furniture.": 1,
    " We came up with a solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it and trying to portray Laminate and a trailer in kind of a fresh new contemporary look.": 1,
    " When this trailer showed up at my shop in Berkeley, I'd actually never stepped foot in an Airstream trailer or any other trailer.": 1,
    "So I can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can optimize it.": 1,
    " in its most idealistic fashion.": 1,
    "I decided I had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of Airstream.": 1,
    " What I discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces and that the shell": 1,
    " was originally conceived as a lightweight, modern, futuristic, high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway.": 1,
    " the interiors were completely out of sync with that.": 1,
    "In fact, it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin.": 1,
    "That seemed": 1,
    " really like a crisis to me that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape and about travel and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell.": 1,
    " We really needed to do some archaeology in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic in an Airstream trailer and what feels": 1,
    " like it has true purpose and utility.": 1,
    "We stripped out all the vinyl and zolotone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell.": 1,
    " We took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing.": 1,
    "I literally": 1,
    " drew on the walls of the trailer, mocked it up in cardboard.": 1,
    "We'd come in and cut, decide things were wrong, pull it out, put it back in.": 1,
    "The main goal was to smooth out the interior": 1,
    " and begin to speak about motion and mobility and independence.": 1,
    "The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you're designing there's actually no logical place to stop and start materials.": 1,
    " because of the continuous form of the trailer, there's no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together where you can change materials and shapes.": 1,
    "So that became a challenge.": 1,
    " compounding that, the material of choice, laminate, that I was trying to highlight only bends in two dimensions.": 1,
    "It's a compound curve interior.": 1,
    "What I had to devise was a way of": 1,
    " fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell.": 1,
    "What I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float": 1,
    " over the aluminum shell and what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way and that the casework wouldn't": 1,
    " break up the space.": 1,
    "They also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin so they function as an electrical chase.": 1,
    "So that's the trailer pretty much finished.": 1,
    " That trailer led to another commission to participate in what's called Tokyo Designers Block, and it's a week of furniture design events in Tokyo in October.": 1,
    " Teruo Kurosaki, who owns a furniture company called E-Day, he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo.": 1,
    "He said,": 1,
    " he would like to make a real trailer functioning and we would sell that one.": 1,
    "Trailer number two, you have a blank slate.": 1,
    "You can do anything you want.": 1,
    " We came up with a fantasy scenario of a DJ traveling around the states that would collect records and go on tours.": 1,
    "This trailer housed": 1,
    " Two turntables, mixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system.": 1,
    "It's got a huge couch that fits quite a few people and basically we've had a great time with this.": 1,
    " And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel and escape in an idiosyncratic sense.": 1,
    "So a lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for Airstream.": 1,
    " This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream.": 1,
    "They came to me and said, well, what can we do to freshen this thing up?": 1,
    "And do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers?": 1,
    " rock climbers would use these things.": 1,
    "And I said, well, not in that interior.": 1,
    "But anyway, I went out to Airstream.": 1,
    " about six times during this process of building this prototype, and it's called the Bambi prototype.": 1,
    "I thought finally, oh yeah, great, big company, I'm gonna work with somebody with money for...": 1,
    " tooling and molding and I walked into their prototype facility and it's exactly like my shop only bigger and same tools same thing so the problem became and they set this dilemma to me that": 1,
    " You have to design the interior using only our existing technology.": 1,
    "And there's no money for tooling or molding.": 1,
    " The trailers themselves are actually hand built.": 1,
    "All the case work is hand scribed in uniquely.": 1,
    "So you can't just cut a hundred parts for a hundred trailers.": 1,
    "You have to cut them big and every single one is hand fit.": 1,
    "They didn't want to go to a componentized.": 1,
    " system.": 1,
    " And there it is, that's the Bambi 16.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
