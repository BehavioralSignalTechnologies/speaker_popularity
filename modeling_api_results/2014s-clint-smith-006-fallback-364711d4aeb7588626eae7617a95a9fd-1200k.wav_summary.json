    " Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.": 1,
    "in a 1968 speech where he reflects upon the civil rights movement states, in the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.": 1,
    " As a teacher, I've internalized this message.": 1,
    "Every day all around us, we see the consequences of silence manifest themselves in the form of discrimination, violence, genocide, and war.": 1,
    " In the classroom, I challenge my students to explore the silences in their own lives through poetry.": 1,
    "We work together to fill those spaces, to recognize them, to name them, to understand that they don't have to be sources of shame.": 1,
    " In an effort to create a culture within my classroom where students feel safe sharing the intimacies of their own silences, I have four core principles posted on the board that sits in the front of my class, which every student signs at the beginning of the year.": 1,
    " Read critically, write consciously, speak clearly, tell your truth.": 1,
    " I find myself thinking a lot about that last point.": 1,
    "Tell your truth.": 1,
    " And I realized that if I was going to ask my students to speak up, I was going to have to tell my truth and be honest with them about the times where I failed to do so.": 1,
    " So I tell them that growing up, as a kid in a Catholic family in New Orleans,": 1,
    " During Lent, I was always taught that the most meaningful thing one could do was to give something up, sacrifice something you typically indulge in to prove to God you understand his sanctity.": 1,
    " I've given up soda, McDonald's, french fries, french kisses, and everything in between.": 1,
    " But one year, I gave up speaking, figured the most valuable thing I could sacrifice was my own voice, but it was like I hadn't realized that I had given that up a long time ago.": 1,
    " I spent so much of my life telling people the things they wanted to hear instead of the things they needed to.": 1,
    "Told myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience because I still had to figure out being my own, so sometimes": 1,
    " I just wouldn't say anything.": 1,
    "Appeasing ignorance with my silence, unaware that validation doesn't need words to endorse its existence.": 1,
    "When Christian was beat up for being gay, I put my hands in my pocket and walked with my head down as if I didn't even notice": 1,
    " Couldn't use my locker for weeks because the bolt on the lock reminded me of the one I put on my lips when the homeless man on the corner looked at me with eyes up, merely searching for an affirmation that he was worth seeing.": 1,
    " I was more concerned with touching the screen of my apple than actually feeding him one when the woman at the fundraising gala said, I'm so proud of you.": 1,
    "It must be so hard teaching those poor, unintelligent kids.": 1,
    "I bit my lip.": 1,
    " because apparently we needed her money more than my students needed their dignity.": 1,
    "We spend so much time.": 1,
    " listening to the things people are saying.": 1,
    " that we rarely pay attention to the things they don't.": 1,
    " Silence is the residue of fear.": 1,
    "It is feeling your flaws, gut-wrenching guillotine, your tongue.": 1,
    "It is the air retreating from your chest because it doesn't feel safe in your lungs.": 1,
    "Silence is Rwandan genocide.": 1,
    "Silence is Katrina.": 1,
    "It is what you hear.": 1,
    " when there aren't enough body bags left.": 1,
    "It is the sound after the noose is already tied.": 1,
    "It is charring.": 1,
    "It is chains.": 1,
    "It is privilege.": 1,
    "It is pain.": 1,
    "There is no time to pick your battles.": 1,
    " When your battles have already picked you, I will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision.": 1,
    "I will tell Christian that he is a lion, a sanctuary of bravery and brilliance.": 1,
    "I will ask that homeless man what his name is and how his day was because sometimes all people want to be": 1,
    " is human.": 1,
    "I will tell that woman that my students can talk about transendentalism like their last name was Thoreau.": 1,
    "And just because you watch one episode of The Wire doesn't mean you know anything about my kids.": 1,
    "So this year, instead of giving something up,": 1,
    " I will live every day as if there were a microphone tucked under my tongue, a stage on the underside of my inhibition.": 1,
    "Because who has to have a soapbox when all you've ever needed": 1,
    " is your voice.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
