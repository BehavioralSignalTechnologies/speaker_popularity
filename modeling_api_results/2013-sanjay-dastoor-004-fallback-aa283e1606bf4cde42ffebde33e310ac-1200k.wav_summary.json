    " Today I'm going to show you an electric vehicle.": 1,
    " that weighs less than a bicycle.": 1,
    " that you can carry with you anywhere.": 1,
    " that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in 15 minutes, and you can run it for 1,000 kilometers on about a dollar of electricity.": 1,
    " But when I say the word electric vehicle, people think about vehicles.": 1,
    "They think about cars and motorcycles and bicycles and the vehicles that you use every day.": 1,
    " But if you come about it from a different perspective, you can create some more interesting, more novel concepts.": 1,
    "So we built something.": 1,
    "I've got some of the pieces in my pocket here.": 1,
    "So this is the motor.": 1,
    " This motor has enough power to take you up the hills of San Francisco at about 20 miles per hour, about 30 kilometers an hour.": 1,
    "And this battery...": 1,
    " This battery right here has about six miles of range, or 10 kilometers, which is enough to cover about half of the car trips in the US alone.": 1,
    " But the best part about these components is that we bought them at a toy store.": 1,
    "These are from remote control airplanes.": 1,
    "And the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently,": 1,
    " you can really change things.": 1,
    "So today we're going to show you one example of how you can use this.": 1,
    "Pay attention to not only how fun this thing is, but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco.": 1,
    " So I'm going to show you what this thing can do.": 1,
    " It's really maneuverable.": 1,
    "You have a handheld remote, so you can pretty easily control acceleration, braking, going reverse if you'd like.": 1,
    "Also have braking.": 1,
    " It's incredible just how light this thing is.": 1,
    "I mean this is something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go.": 1,
    " So I'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles.": 1,
    "This uses 20 times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car.": 1,
    " which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build, but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use in terms of your transportation.": 1,
    "So instead of looking at": 1,
    " large amounts of energy needed for each person in this room to get around in a city.": 1,
    "Now you can look at much smaller amounts and more sustainable transportation.": 1,
    "So next time you think about a vehicle, I hope like us you're thinking about something new.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
