    " This is where I live.": 1,
    "I live in Kenya, at the south part of the Nairobi National Park.": 1,
    "Those are my dad's cows at the back, and behind the cows, that's the Nairobi National Park.": 1,
    " Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south where I live, which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely.": 1,
    " So predators like lions, follow them.": 1,
    "And this is what they do.": 1,
    " They kill our livestock!": 1,
    " It's one of the cows which was killed at night and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead and I felt so bad because it was the only bull we had.": 1,
    " My community, the Maasai, we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land, for adding them, and that's why we value them so much.": 1,
    " So I grew up hating land so much.": 1,
    " The morons are the warriors who protected our community and the livestock.": 1,
    " and they are also upset about this problem.": 1,
    " So they kill their lands.": 1,
    "It's one of the six lands which are killed in Nairobi.": 1,
    " And I think this is where the Nairobi National Park learns a few.": 1,
    " So a boy from 6 to 9 years old in my community is responsible for his dad's cause.": 1,
    "And that's the same thing which happened to me.": 1,
    "So I had to find a way of solving this problem.": 1,
    " And the first idea I got was to use fire, because I thought Lance was scared of fire.": 1,
    " But I came to realize that that didn't really help because it was even helping the lens to see through the caution.": 1,
    " So I didn't give up.": 1,
    "I continued.": 1,
    "And the second idea I got was to use a scarecrow.": 1,
    "I was trying to trick the lambs that I was standing near the caution.": 1,
    "The lambs are very clever.": 1,
    " They will come the first day, and they see the scarecrow, and they go back.": 1,
    "But the second day, they'll come and say, this thing is not moving here.": 1,
    "It's always here.": 1,
    "So it jumps in and kills the animals.": 1,
    " So one night I was walking around the car shed with a torch and that day the lens didn't come.": 1,
    "And I discovered that the lens was afraid of a moving light.": 1,
    "So I had an idea.": 1,
    " Since I was a small boy, I used to work in my room for the whole day.": 1,
    " And I even took apart my mom's new radio.": 1,
    "And that day, she almost killed me.": 1,
    "But I learned a lot about electronics.": 1,
    " So, I got a old car battery.": 1,
    " and indicate a box.": 1,
    "It's a small device found in a motorcycle.": 1,
    "And it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left, it blinks.": 1,
    "And I've got a switch.": 1,
    "I can switch on the lights on and off.": 1,
    " And that's a small touch from a broken flashlight.": 1,
    " So I set up everything.": 1,
    "As you can see, the solar panel charges the battery, and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box.": 1,
    "I call it a transformer.": 1,
    "And the indicator box": 1,
    " makes the lines to flush.": 1,
    "And as you can see, the bulbs face outside because that's where the lines come from.": 1,
    " And that's how he looks to lions when they come at night.": 1,
    "The lights flash and trick lions that I was walking around the couch, but I was sleeping in my bed.": 1,
    " Thanks.": 1,
    " So I set it up in my home two years ago, and since then, you have never experienced any problem with the lens.": 1,
    "And my neighboring homes heard about this idea.": 1,
    "One of them was this grandmother.": 1,
    " She had a lot of animals being killed by lions.": 1,
    "And she asked me if I can put the lights for her.": 1,
    "And I said, yes.": 1,
    "So I put the lights.": 1,
    "You can see at the back, those are the land lights.": 1,
    " Since now, I've set up seven bombers around my community and they're really working.": 1,
    " And my idea is also being used now in all over Kenya.": 1,
    " for scaring other predators like hyenas.": 1,
    " Leopards and also it's also being used to scare elephants away from people's farms.": 1,
    " Because of this invention, I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited about this.": 1,
    "My new school now is coming in and helping.": 1,
    " by fundraising and creating an awareness.": 1,
    " I even took back my friends to my community and were installing the lights to the homes which don't have and I'm teaching them how to put them.": 1,
    " So, one year ago, I was just a boy in the Savannah grassland, hiding my father's cows, and I used to see planes flying over, and I told myself that one day I'll be there inside.": 1,
    " And here I am today.": 1,
    "I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for third.": 1,
    "So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up.": 1,
    " I used to wear the lance, but now because my invention is serving my father's cause and the lance, we are able to stay with the lance without any conflict.": 1,
    " Surely, it means my language.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1,
    " You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.": 1,
    "So, you've got the scholarship.": 1,
    "You're working on other electrical inventions.": 1,
    "What's the next one on your list?": 1,
    " My next invention is I want to make an electric fence.": 1,
    "But I know electric fences are already invented, but I want to make mine.": 1,
    " You already tried it once, right?": 1,
    "I've tried it before, but I stopped because it gave me a shock.": 1,
    " in the trenches.": 1,
    "Richard Tereri, you are something else.": 1,
    "We're going to cheer you on every step of the way, my friend.": 1,
    "Thank you so much.": 1
