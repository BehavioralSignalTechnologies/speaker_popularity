    " So I grew up in Limpopo, on the border of Limpopo and Limpumalanga, little town called Mutetema.": 1,
    "Water and electricity supply are as unpredictable as the weather.": 1,
    " And growing up in these tough situations, at the age of 17, I was relaxing with a couple of friends of mine in winter, and we were sunbathing.": 1,
    "The Limpopo sun gets really hot in winter.": 1,
    " So, as we were sunbathing, my best friend next to me says, man, why doesn't somebody invent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don't have to bath?": 1,
    " And I sat and I was like, man, I'll buy that.": 1,
    "So I went home and I did a little research and I found some very shocking statistics.": 1,
    " Over 2.5 billion people in the world today do not have proper access to water and sanitation.": 1,
    "450 million of them are in Africa and 5 million of them are in South Africa.": 1,
    " Various diseases thrive in this environment, the most drastic of which is called trachoma.": 1,
    "Trachoma is an infection of the eye due to dirt getting into your eye.": 1,
    " Multiple infections of trachoma can leave you permanently blind.": 1,
    "The disease leaves 8 million people permanently blind each and every year.": 1,
    " The shocking part about it is that to avoid being infected with trachoma, all you have to do is wash your face.": 1,
    "No medicine, no pills, no injections.": 1,
    " So after seeing these shocking statistics, I thought to myself, okay, even if I'm not just doing it for myself and the fact that I don't want to boss, I at least need to do it to try to save the world.": 1,
    " So, with my trusty little speed, my Nokia 6234 cell phone, I didn't have a laptop, I didn't have internet much, except for the 20-rand internet cafe.": 1,
    " I did research on Wikipedia, on Google about lotions, creams, the compositions, the melting points, the toxicities.": 1,
    "I did high school science.": 1,
    "And I wrote down a little formula on a piece of paper.": 1,
    "And it looked like the KFC special spice, you know?": 1,
    " I was like, okay, so we've got the formula ready, now we need to get this thing into practice.": 1,
    "Fast forward four years later.": 1,
    " After having written a 40-page business plan on the cell phone, having written my patent on the cell phone, I'm the youngest patent holder in the country.": 1,
    " I can't say any more than that.": 1,
    "I had invented dry bath, the world's first bath substituting lotion.": 1,
    "You literally put it on your skin and you don't have to bath.": 1,
    " So after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources I had, went to university, met a few people, got it into practice, and we have a fully functioning product that's ready to go to the market.": 1,
    "It's actually available on the market.": 1,
    " So, we learned a few lessons in commercializing and making dry bath available.": 1,
    " One of the things we learned was that poor communities don't buy products in bulk.": 1,
    "They buy products on demand.": 1,
    "A person in Alex doesn't buy a box of cigarettes.": 1,
    "They buy one cigarette each day, even though it's more expensive.": 1,
    " So we package dry bath in these innovative little sachets.": 1,
    "You just snap them in half and you squeeze it out.": 1,
    "And the cool part is one sachet substitutes one bath for five rand.": 1,
    " After creating that model, we also learned a lot in terms of implementing the product.": 1,
    "We realized that even rich kids from the suburbs really want Drybot.": 1,
    " At least once a week.": 1,
    " Anyway, we realized that we could save 80 million liters of water on average each time they skipped a bath, and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas, two hours more for school, two hours more for homework, two hours more to just be": 1,
    " a kid.": 1,
    "After seeing that global impact, we narrowed it down to our key value proposition, which was cleanliness and convenience.": 1,
    "Dry bath is a rich man's convenience and a poor man's lifesaver.": 1,
    " Having put the product into practice, we're actually now on the verge of selling the product onto a multinational to take it to the retail market.": 1,
    "And one question I have for the audience today is, on the gravel roads of Limpopo,": 1,
    " With an allowance of 50 Rand a week, I came up with a way for the world not to bust.": 1,
    "What's stopping you?": 1,
    " I'm not done yet.": 1,
    " And another key thing that I learned a lot throughout this whole process, last year Google named me as one of the brightest young minds in the world.": 1,
    "I'm also currently the best student entrepreneur in the world, the first African to get that accolade.": 1,
    " And one thing that really puzzles me is I did all of this just because I didn't want to pass.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
