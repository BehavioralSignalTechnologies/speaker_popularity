    " As a boy, I loved cars.": 1,
    "When I turned 18, I lost my best friend to a car accident.": 1,
    " like this.": 1,
    " And then I decided I'd dedicate my life to saving 1 million people every year.": 1,
    "Now, I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report, but I need to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars.": 1,
    " I saw the concept first in the Dakar Grand Challenges, where the US government issued a prize to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert.": 1,
    "And even though a hundred teams were there, these cars went nowhere.": 1,
    " So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.": 1,
    "We built the hardware, the software.": 1,
    "We made it learn from us.": 1,
    "And we set it free in the desert.": 1,
    " And the unimaginable happened.": 1,
    "It became the first car to ever return from a double grand challenge, winning Stanford $2 million.": 1,
    " yet I still haven't saved a single life.": 1,
    " Since our workers focused on building driving cars, they can drive anywhere by themselves.": 1,
    "Any street in California.": 1,
    "We've driven 140,000 miles.": 1,
    " Our cars have sensors in which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving.": 1,
    " It's the perfect driving mechanism.": 1,
    "We've driven in cities, like in San Francisco here.": 1,
    "We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1.": 1,
    " You've encountered joggers, busy highways, tall booths, and this is without a person in the loop.": 1,
    "The car just drives itself.": 1,
    "In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles, people didn't even notice.": 1,
    " Mountain roads, day and night.": 1,
    " and even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco.": 1,
    " Sometimes our cars get so crazy, they even do little stunts.": 1,
    " Oh my god.": 1,
    " What?": 1,
    " It's so": 1,
    " No, I can't get my friend Harold back to life, but I can do something for all the people who died.": 1,
    "Did you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people?": 1,
    " And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error and can therefore be prevented by machines?": 1,
    " Do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we didn't rely on human precision on staying in the lane, but on robotic precision, and thereby drive a little bit closer together?": 1,
    " a little bit narrower lanes, and do away with all traffic jams on highways.": 1,
    " Do you realize that you, TED users, spend an average of 52 minutes per day in traffic wasting your time on your daily commute?": 1,
    " You could regain this time.": 1,
    " This is 4 billion hours wasted in this country alone, and it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted.": 1,
    " Now, I think there's a vision here, a new technology, and I'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
