    " The greatest irony in global health is that the poorest countries carry the largest disease burden.": 1,
    "If we say the countries of the globe in proportion to the subject of interest,": 1,
    " We see that sub-Saharan Africa is the worst hit region by HIV AIDS.": 1,
    "This is the most devastating epidemic of our time.": 1,
    " We also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease.": 1,
    "There are very few doctors, and quite frankly, these countries do not have the resources": 1,
    " that are needed to cope with such epidemics.": 1,
    "So what the Western countries, developed countries have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in third world countries who actually can't afford these medications.": 1,
    " And this has already saved millions of lives and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in sub-Saharan Africa.": 1,
    "But there is a fundamental problem that is": 1,
    " killing the efforts in fighting this disease because if you keep throwing drugs at people": 1,
    " who don't have diagnostic services, you end up creating a problem of drug resistance.": 1,
    "This is already beginning to happen in sub Saharan Africa.": 1,
    " The problem is that what begins as a tragedy in the third world could easily become a global problem.": 1,
    "And the last thing we want to see is drug resistant strains of": 1,
    " HIV popping up all over the world because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre-era of the carnage of HIV AIDS.": 1,
    " I experienced this first-hand as a high school student in Uganda.": 1,
    "This was in the 90s, during the peak of the HIV epidemic.": 1,
    " before there were any Arabs in sub-Saharan Africa.": 1,
    "And during that time I actually lost more relatives as well as the teachers who taught me to HIV AIDS.": 1,
    "So this became one of the driving passions of my life to help": 1,
    " find real solutions that could address these kinds of problems.": 1,
    "We all know about the miracle of miniaturization.": 1,
    "Back in the days computers used to fill this entire room.": 1,
    " and people actually used to work inside the computers.": 1,
    "But what electronic materialization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink": 1,
    " technology into a cell phone and I'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world in the third world countries.": 1,
    " The good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological laboratories.": 1,
    "So right now we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories": 1,
    " onto microfluidic chips.": 1,
    "I was very lucky to come to the U.S.": 1,
    "right after high school and was able to work on this technology and develop some devices.": 1,
    "This is a microfluidic chip that I developed.": 1,
    " A close look at how the technology works.": 1,
    "These are channels that are about the size of a human hair.": 1,
    "So you have integrated valves, pumps, mixers, and injectors so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system.": 1,
    " So what I plan to do with this technology is to actually take the current state of the technology and build an HIV kit in a microfluidic system.": 1,
    "So with one microfluidic chip, which is the size of an iPhone,": 1,
    " You can actually diagnose 100 patients at the same time.": 1,
    "For each patient, we will be able to do up to 100 different viral loads per patient.": 1,
    "And this is only done in four hours, 50 times faster than the current set of the art.": 1,
    " at a cost that will be 5 to 500 times cheaper.": 1,
    " than the current options.": 1,
    "So this will allow us to create personalized medicines in the third world at a cost that is actually achievable and make the world a safer place.": 1,
    "I invite your interest as well as your involvement": 1,
    " in driving this vision to a point of practical reality.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
