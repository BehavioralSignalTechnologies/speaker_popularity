    " I just came back from a community that holds a secret to human survival.": 1,
    " It's a place where women run the show, have sex to say hello, and play rules a day.": 1,
    "Where fun is serious business.": 1,
    "And no, this isn't Burning Man or San Francisco.": 1,
    " Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.": 1,
    "This is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of Congo.": 1,
    " Burnobos are, together with chimpanzees, your living closest relative.": 1,
    "That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived around 6 million years ago.": 1,
    " Now, chimpanzees are well known for their aggression.": 1,
    " But unfortunately, we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.": 1,
    " But Bonobos show us the other side of the coin.": 1,
    "While chimpanzees are dominated by big scary guys, Bonobo society is run by empowered females.": 1,
    " These guys have really worked something out since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet.": 1,
    " But unfortunately, bonobos are the least understood of the great apes.": 1,
    "They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle, and it has been very difficult to study them.": 1,
    " Dear Congo is a paradox, a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of darkness itself.": 1,
    " the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War.": 1,
    " Not surprisingly, this destruction also endangers bonobo survival.": 1,
    "Bush meat trade and forest laws means we couldn't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world.": 1,
    " And we're not even sure of that, to be honest.": 1,
    " Yet, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees.": 1,
    "Who are these cousins?": 1,
    " We know them as they make love not war apes.": 1,
    " since they have frequent, promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues.": 1,
    "Now, I'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanity's problems.": 1,
    " Since there's more to bonobo life than the Kama Sutra.": 1,
    " Bonobos like humans love to play throughout their entire lives.": 1,
    "Play is not just child's games.": 1,
    "For us and them, play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance.": 1,
    "It's where we learn to trust.": 1,
    " and where we learn about the rules of the game.": 1,
    " Play increases creativity and resilience.": 1,
    "And it's all about the generation of diversity.": 1,
    "Diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.": 1,
    " And when you watch vulnerable play, you're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter, dance and ritual.": 1,
    "Play is the glue that binds us together.": 1,
    " Now, I don't know how you play, but I want to show you a couple of unique clips, fresh from the wild.": 1,
    "First, it's a ball game, bonobo style.": 1,
    " And I do not mean football.": 1,
    "So here, we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game.": 1,
    " Have a look what she's doing.": 1,
    "It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, she's got him by the balls.": 1,
    " I think he's rather loving it here, right?": 1,
    " Yeah.": 1,
    " So sex play is common in both bonobos and humans.": 1,
    "And this video is really interesting because it shows...": 1,
    " This video is really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play, such as testicles, and also how play balls requires trust and fosters trust.": 1,
    " while at the same time being tremendous fun.": 1,
    "But play as a shapeshifter.": 1,
    " Footplay is a shapeshifter and it can take many forms, some of which are more quiet, imaginative, curious, maybe where wonder is discovered anew.": 1,
    " And I want you to see, this is Fuku, a young female, and she's quietly playing with water.": 1,
    "I think, like her, we sometimes play alone, and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds.": 1,
    " And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, drives us to interact.": 1,
    "And then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity.": 1,
    " So these are just small tasters into the insights that Bonobo gave us to our past and present.": 1,
    " But they also hold the secret for a future.": 1,
    "A future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world, through greater creativity and greater cooperation.": 1,
    " The secret is that play is the key to these capacities.": 1,
    "In other words, play is our adaptive wild card.": 1,
    "In order to adapt successfully to a changing world, we need to play.": 1,
    " But will we make the most of our playfulness?": 1,
    "Play is not frivolous.": 1,
    " plays essential.": 1,
    "For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just read in tooth and claw.": 1,
    "In times when it seems least appropriate to play, it might be the times when it's most urgent.": 1,
    " And so, my fellow primates, let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together as we rediscover creativity, fellowship, and wonder.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
