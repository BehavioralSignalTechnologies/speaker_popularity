    " The High Line is an old elevated rail line that runs for a mile and a half right through Manhattan.": 1,
    "And it was originally a freight line that ran down 10th Avenue.": 1,
    " And it became known as Death Avenue because so many people were run over by the trains that the railroad hired a guy on horseback to run in front and he became known as the West Side Cowboy.": 1,
    " But even with a cowboy, about one person a month was killed and run over.": 1,
    " So they elevated it.": 1,
    "They built it 30 feet in the air, right through the middle of the city.": 1,
    "But with the rise of interstate trucking, it was used less and less.": 1,
    "And by 1980, the last train rode, it was a trainload of frozen turkeys, they say at Thanksgiving.": 1,
    " from the meatpacking district, and then it was abandoned.": 1,
    "And I live in the neighborhood, and I first read about it in the New York Times in an article that said it was going to be demolished.": 1,
    " And I assumed someone was working to preserve it or save it, and I could volunteer, but realized no one was doing anything.": 1,
    "I went to my first community board meeting, which I'd never...": 1,
    " than to one before, and sat next to another guy named Joshua David, who was a travel writer.": 1,
    "And at the end of the meeting, we realized we were the only two people that were sort of interested in the project.": 1,
    "Most people wanted to tear it down.": 1,
    " So we exchanged business cards and we kept calling each other and decided to start this organization, Friends of the High Line.": 1,
    " And the goal at first was just saving it from demolition.": 1,
    "But then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it.": 1,
    "And what first attracted me or interested me was this": 1,
    " this view from the street, which is this steel structure, sort of rusty, this industrial relic.": 1,
    "But when I went up on top, it was a mile and a half of wildflowers running right through the middle of Manhattan.": 1,
    " you know, with views of the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty and the Hudson River.": 1,
    "And that's really where we started the idea of coalesced around, let's make this a park and let's have it be sort of inspired by this wildscape.": 1,
    " At the time, there was a lot of opposition.": 1,
    "Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down.": 1,
    "I'm going to fast forward through a lot of lawsuits and a lot of sort of community engagement.": 1,
    " Mayor Bloomberg came in office.": 1,
    "He was very supportive, but we still had to make the economic case You know, this was after 9-eleven the city was in tough times": 1,
    " So we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the case.": 1,
    "And it turns out we got those numbers wrong.": 1,
    "We thought it would cost $100 million to build.": 1,
    "So far it's cost about $150 million.": 1,
    " And the main case was this is going to make good economic sense for the city.": 1,
    "So we said over a 20 year time period, the value to the city and increased property values and increased taxes.": 1,
    " would be about 250 million.": 1,
    "That was enough.": 1,
    "It really got the city behind it.": 1,
    "It turns out we were wrong on that.": 1,
    "Now people estimate it's created about a half a billion dollars, or will create about a half a billion dollars.": 1,
    " and tax revenues for the city.": 1,
    "We did a design competition, selected a design team.": 1,
    "We worked with them to really create a design that was inspired by that sort of wildscape.": 1,
    " There's three sections.": 1,
    "We opened the first section in 2009.": 1,
    "It's been sort of successful beyond our dreams.": 1,
    "Last year we had about 2 million people, which is about 10 times what we ever estimated.": 1,
    " This is one of my favorite features in Section 1.": 1,
    "It's this amphitheater right over 10th Avenue.": 1,
    "And the first section ends at 20th Street right now.": 1,
    "The other thing, it's generated obviously a lot of economic value.": 1,
    " It's also inspired, I think, a lot of great architectures.": 1,
    "There's a point where you can stand here and see buildings by Frank Gehry, Jean Nouvel, Shigeru Ban, Neil Denari, and the Whitney is moving downtown.": 1,
    " and is building their new museum right at the base of the High Line and this has been designed by Rinzo Piano and they're going to break ground in May.": 1,
    " And we've already started construction on section two.": 1,
    "This is one of my favorite features, this flyover where you're eight feet off the surface of the High Line running through a canopy of trees.": 1,
    "The High Line used to be covered in billboards.": 1,
    " And so we've sort of taken a playful take where instead of framing advertisement, it's going to frame people and views of the city.": 1,
    "This was just installed last month.": 1,
    " And then the last section, it was going to go around the rail yards, which is the largest undeveloped site in Manhattan.": 1,
    "And the city has planned, for better or for worse, a 12 million square feet of development that the High Line is going to ring around.": 1,
    " But, you know, what really I think makes the Highline special is the people.": 1,
    "And honestly, even though I love the designs that we were building, I was always frightened that I wouldn't really love it because I fell in love with that wildscape.": 1,
    "And how could you recreate that magic?": 1,
    " But what I found is it's in the people and how they use it that to me makes it so special.": 1,
    "And just one quick example.": 1,
    " is I realized right after we opened that there were all these people holding hands on the High Line, and I realized New Yorkers don't hold hands.": 1,
    " We just don't do that outside.": 1,
    "But you see that happening on the High Line, and I think that's the power that public space can have to transform how people experience their city and interact with each other.": 1,
    "Thanks.": 1
