    " What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple request.": 1,
    "I'd like all of you to pause for a moment, you wretched weaklings, and take stock of your miserable existence.": 1,
    " Now, that was the advice that St.": 1,
    "Benedict gave his rather startled followers in the 5th century.": 1,
    "It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned 40.": 1,
    " Up until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior.": 1,
    "I was eating too much, I was drinking too much, I was working too hard, and I was neglecting my family.": 1,
    " And I decided that I would try and turn my life around.": 1,
    "In particular, I decided I would try to address the thorny issue of work-life balance.": 1,
    " So I stepped back from the workforce and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children.": 1,
    " But all I learned about work-life balance from that year was that I found it quite easy to balance work and life when I didn't have any work.": 1,
    " not a very useful skill, especially when the money runs out.": 1,
    "So I went back to work, and I've spent the seven years since struggling with": 1,
    " studying and writing about work-life balance.": 1,
    "I have four observations I'd like to share with you today.": 1,
    " The first is if society is to make any progress on this issue, we need an honest debate.": 1,
    "But the trouble is, so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance.": 1,
    " All the discussions about flexi time or dress down Fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue.": 1,
    " which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day-to-day basis with a young family.": 1,
    " Now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in.": 1,
    "And the reality of the society that we're in": 1,
    " is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation.": 1,
    " where they work long, hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't like.": 1,
    " And it's my contention that going to work on a Friday in jeans and t-shirt isn't really getting to the nub of the issue.": 1,
    " The second observation I'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren't going to solve this issue for us.": 1,
    " We should stop looking outside.": 1,
    "It's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead.": 1,
    " If you don't design your life, someone else will design it for you and you may just not like their idea of balance.": 1,
    " It's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation.": 1,
    " Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies, the abattoirs of the human soul as I call them.": 1,
    " I'm talking about all companies because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you as they can get away with.": 1,
    " It's in their nature, it's in their DNA, it's what they do.": 1,
    "Even the good, well-intentioned companies.": 1,
    "On the one hand, putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened.": 1,
    " On the other hand, it's a nightmare that just means you spend more time at the bloody office.": 1,
    " We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life.": 1,
    " The third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance.": 1,
    " Before I went back to work after my year at home, I sat down and I wrote out a": 1,
    " detailed step-by-step description of the ideal balanced day that I aspire to.": 1,
    " And it went like this.": 1,
    "Wake up, well rested, after a good night's sleep.": 1,
    " Have sex.": 1,
    " Walk the dog.": 1,
    "Have breakfast with my wife and children.": 1,
    "Have sex again.": 1,
    " Drive the kids to school on the way to the office.": 1,
    "Do three hours work.": 1,
    "Play sport with a friend at lunchtime.": 1,
    "Do another three hours work.": 1,
    "Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink.": 1,
    " drive home for dinner with my wife and kids, meditate for half an hour, have sex,": 1,
    " Walk the dog Have sex again Go to bed": 1,
    " How often do you think I had that day?": 1,
    " We need to be realistic.": 1,
    "You can't do it all in one day.": 1,
    "We need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life, but we need to elongate it": 1,
    " without falling into the trap of the I'll have a life when I retire.": 1,
    "When my kids have left home, my wife has divorced me, my health is failing, I've got no mates or interests left.": 1,
    " A day is too short after a retire is too long.": 1,
    "There's got to be a middle way.": 1,
    " A fourth observation, we need to approach balance in a balanced way.": 1,
    " A friend came to see me last year, and she doesn't mind me telling this story, a friend came to see me last year and said Nigel, I've read your book and I've realised that my life is completely out of balance.": 1,
    "It's totally dominated by work.": 1,
    " I work ten hours a day, I commute two hours a day.": 1,
    "All my relationships have failed.": 1,
    "There's nothing in my life apart from my work.": 1,
    "So I've decided to get a grip and sort it out.": 1,
    "So I've joined a gym.": 1,
    " Now I don't mean to mock, but being a fit 10 hour a day office rat isn't more balanced, it's more fit.": 1,
    " Lovely, though physical exercise may be.": 1,
    "There are other parts to life.": 1,
    "There's the intellectual side, there's the emotional side, there's the spiritual side.": 1,
    "And to be balanced,": 1,
    " I believe we have to attend to all of those areas, not just do 50 stomach crunches.": 1,
    " Now, that can be daunting, because people say, bloody hell mate, I haven't got time to get fit.": 1,
    "You want me to go to church and call my mother?": 1,
    " And I truly understand how that can be daunting.": 1,
    "But an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective.": 1,
    "My wife, who is somewhere in the audience today, called me up at the office.": 1,
    " and said, Nigel, you need to pick our younger son up, Harry, from school.": 1,
    "She had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening.": 1,
    "So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates.": 1,
    " We walked down to the local park, messed around on the swings, played some silly games.": 1,
    "I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe and we shared a pizza for tea.": 1,
    " then walked down the hill to our home and I gave him his bath and put him in his Batman pajamas.": 1,
    "I then read him a chapter of Roald Dahl's James and the Giant Peach.": 1,
    " I then put him to bed, tucked him in, gave him a kiss on his forehead, and said, good night, mate, and walked out of his bedroom.": 1,
    "As I was walking out of his bedroom, he said, Dad.": 1,
    "I went, yes, mate.": 1,
    "He went, Dad, this has been the best day of my life.": 1,
    " Ever.": 1,
    " I haven't done anything.": 1,
    " hadn't taken him to Disney World and bought him a PlayStation.": 1,
    "Now my point is, the small things matter.": 1,
    " Being more balanced doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life.": 1,
    "With the smallest investment in the right places, you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life.": 1,
    " Moreover, I think it can transform society.": 1,
    "Because if enough people do it, we can change society's definition of success.": 1,
    " away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins, to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like.": 1,
    " And that, I think, is an idea worth spreading.": 1
