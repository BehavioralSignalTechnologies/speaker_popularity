    " Okay.": 1,
    " Merci.": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1,
    "Thank you for your welcome.": 1,
    "This dive you just saw is a journey.": 1,
    "A journey between two inspirations.": 1,
    " A journey that begins between two inspirations, the last one before leaving, and the first one when I return to the surface.": 1,
    "This dive is a journey to the border of human limits, a journey to the unknown.": 1,
    " but it is also and above all an inner journey, where a lot of things happen, whether physiological or mental, and that's why I'm here today among you, to share this journey with you and bring you with me.": 1,
    " So we start with the last breath.": 1,
    " This last breath is slow, deep and intense.": 1,
    "I even finish with a maneuver called the carp, which allows me to store 1 to 2 liters of air in my lungs by compressing that air.": 1,
    " I leave the surface and I have about 10 liters of air in my lungs.": 1,
    " I just left the surface, and the first mechanism starts to work, the diving reflex.": 1,
    "Diving reflex, first of all, is the heart rate that will drop.": 1,
    " I'll go from 60-70 pulses per minute to 30-40 pulses per minute, almost instantly.": 1,
    " Second effect, we will have a peripheral vasoconstriction, that is to say that we will have the blood flows that will leave the extremities of the body to go to feed in priority the noble organs, the lungs, the heart and the brain.": 1,
    " This mechanism is innate.": 1,
    "I don't control it.": 1,
    "And you, if you put yourself in the water, even if you have never put your head in the water, you will have the same mechanism that will take place.": 1,
    "All human beings, we share.": 1,
    " It's the same property, and what is extraordinary is that we have in common this mechanism with marine mammals, all marine mammals, dolphins, whales, otaries, etc.": 1,
    "When they dive into apnea and go down in depth, they have this mechanism that starts.": 1,
    " in a much stronger way, and it works much better for them, of course.": 1,
    " That's absolutely fascinating.": 1,
    "I leave the surface and already I have a first push of nature that allows me to leave in full confidence.": 1,
    "I dive into the blue.": 1,
    " the pressure will slowly crush my lungs.": 1,
    "And because the air volume in my lungs makes me float, the more I go down, the more the pressure crushes my lungs, the less air volume there is.": 1,
    " plus mon corps chute facilement.": 1,
    "Et \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9, arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 35, 40 m\u00e8tres, je n'ai plus besoin de palmer.": 1,
    " My body is heavy and dense enough to fall freely into the depths, and we attack what we call the free fall phase.": 1,
    "The free fall phase is the best time to descend.": 1,
    "That's why I keep diving.": 1,
    " On se sent aspir\u00e9 par le fond.": 1,
    " And we don't need to do anything.": 1,
    "I go down from 35 meters to 123 meters without making any movement.": 1,
    "I let myself be appeased by the depth, and I have the feeling of flying underwater.": 1,
    "It's a completely amazing feeling, a feeling of freedom that is extraordinary.": 1,
    " And I slowly slide towards the bottom.": 1,
    "I pass the 40 meters, 50 meters, and between 50 and 60, a second physiological pallet intervenes.": 1,
    " but the lungs reach their residual volume.": 1,
    "The residual volume is the theoretical volume beyond which the lung is no longer supposed to be able to compress.": 1,
    "And the second phenomenon that occurs is blood shift.": 1,
    "In French, it's pulmonary erection.": 1,
    " I prefer bloodshifts.": 1,
    "So we're going to call it the bloodshift.": 1,
    "What's the mechanism of the bloodshift?": 1,
    "It's the lung wall that's going to gorge itself.": 1,
    " of blood, because of depression, to be able to stiffen and protect the entire thoracic cavity from the crushing, to prevent the two surface of the lungs from collapsing, sticking together.": 1,
    " And thanks to this phenomenon, which is also in common with marine mammals, I can continue to dive.": 1,
    "60 meters, 70 meters, I continue to fall, more and more quickly, because the pressure is crushing my body more and more.": 1,
    "And from 80 meters,": 1,
    " the pressure becomes much stronger and I start to feel it physically, I really start to feel the pressure.": 1,
    "You see what it looks like, it's not pretty, the diaphragm is completely in, the thoracic cage is in.": 1,
    " Mentally, it's true that something is happening.": 1,
    "We say to ourselves, well, it's not very pleasant.": 1,
    "What do we do?": 1,
    "If I have my terrestrial reflexes, what do we do when we have a constraint on Earth, when we have something unpleasant?": 1,
    "We want to resist.": 1,
    "We put ourselves in opposition.": 1,
    "We fight.": 1,
    " Under water, it doesn't work.": 1,
    "If you do that under water, you risk tearing your lungs.": 1,
    "You can spit blood, make an oedema, and the dive stops.": 1,
    "For a while.": 1,
    " So what you have to do with the mind is to say to yourself, nature is stronger, the element is stronger than me, I let the water crush me, I accept this pressure, and I let myself do it.": 1,
    " At this moment, I give my training to my body, my lungs, everything relaxes, I let go completely, and I let go totally.": 1,
    "And then the pressure crushes me, and it's not at all unpleasant.": 1,
    " I feel like a cocoon, I feel protected.": 1,
    "The dive can go on.": 1,
    "80 meters, 85 meters, 90 meters, 100 meters, 100 meters.": 1,
    " It's a mythical number.": 1,
    "It's a mythical number in all sports.": 1,
    "It's a mythical number in swimming, in athletics.": 1,
    "For us, for the athletes, it's a number that makes everyone dream.": 1,
    "Everyone wants to be able to go 100 meters deep one day.": 1,
    " And it's a rather symbolic figure for us because the doctors, the physiologists in the 70s had done their calculations.": 1,
    "They predicted that 100 meters was the limit beyond which the human body could not descend.": 1,
    "Beyond.": 1,
    "They predicted that the body imploded.": 1,
    " And then the little Frenchman, Jacques Mayol, you all know Jacques Mayol, the hero of the Grand Bleu, went through there and plunged 100 meters.": 1,
    " He even dived at 105 meters.": 1,
    "At the time, he dived in no limit, that is, he took a weight to go down faster and go up with a balloon, like in the movie The Great Blue.": 1,
    "Today, in no limit, we go at 200 meters.": 1,
    "I go at 123 meters using the only muscular strength.": 1,
    " And all of this is thanks to him.": 1,
    "Because he shook the ideas he received.": 1,
    "Because he swept from one side to the other.": 1,
    " All these beliefs of theory, all these mental limits that man is able to fix.": 1,
    "He showed that the body has infinite capacity for adaptation.": 1,
    "I continue my fall.": 1,
    "105, 110, 115, the front is approaching.": 1,
    " 120 meters, 123 meters.": 1,
    "I get to the bottom.": 1,
    "And now I'm going to ask you to participate a little and to put yourself in my shoes.": 1,
    "You're going to close your eyes.": 1,
    " And you can imagine, you arrive at 123 meters.": 1,
    " The surface is very, very, very far away.": 1,
    "You are all alone.": 1,
    " There's almost no more light.": 1,
    " It's cold, a glacial cold.": 1,
    "The pressure is completely overwhelming, 13 times bigger than on the surface.": 1,
    " And now I know you're thinking, what a horror!": 1,
    "What am I doing here?": 1,
    "He's completely insane!": 1,
    " Well, no.": 1,
    "That's not what I tell myself when I'm deep down.": 1,
    "When I'm deep down, I feel good.": 1,
    "I have a feeling of extraordinary well-being.": 1,
    "Maybe because I completely gave up all my tensions and let go.": 1,
    " I feel good and I don't feel like breathing.": 1,
    " However, there is something to be worried about.": 1,
    "I feel like a small dot, a drop of water floating in the middle of the ocean.": 1,
    "And each time, this image comes back to my mind.": 1,
    " It's called blue dot.": 1,
    "It means pale blue dot.": 1,
    "It's the little dot we see here.": 1,
    "Entered by the arrow.": 1,
    "Do you know what it is?": 1,
    " is the planet Earth.": 1,
    "The planet Earth was photographed by the Voyager probe 4 billion kilometers away.": 1,
    " And it shows that we, our home, are this little dot floating in the middle of nothingness.": 1,
    "That's the feeling I get when I'm at 123 meters deep.": 1,
    "I feel like a little dot, a grain of dust, star dust.": 1,
    " floating in the middle of the cosmos, in the middle of the void, in the middle of the immensity.": 1,
    "It's a fascinating sensation because I look up, down, left, right...": 1,
    " and I see the same thing, this infinite blue, very deep.": 1,
    "There is nowhere else on Earth where you can have this feeling of looking around you and having this same uniform vision.": 1,
    "It's extraordinary.": 1,
    " And at that moment, there's a feeling each time that comes back to me, and it's a feeling of humility.": 1,
    " I feel a lot of humility when I look at this picture.": 1,
    "And when I find myself at this depth, because I am nothing.": 1,
    "I am a little piece of nothing lost in this great whole.": 1,
    " And it's still completely fascinating.": 1,
    "I decide to go back to the surface because it's not my place.": 1,
    " My place is up there, on the surface, and I start climbing back up.": 1,
    " Going back up was quite a shock when I decided to go back up.": 1,
    " First of all, you have to make a huge effort to get rid of the bottom, because the bottom pulled me down.": 1,
    "It also pulls me up when I want to go back up, so you have to put it twice as hard.": 1,
    " Then, I am affected by another phenomenon, narcosis.": 1,
    "If you know this phenomenon, narcosis, what we call depth livery.": 1,
    "It's a phenomenon that occurs in bottle divers, but also in apneists, which is caused by nitrogen, which dissolves in blood.": 1,
    " and which sows a bit of confusion between the conscious and the unconscious.": 1,
    " There are a lot of thoughts that come, on the right, on the left, it passes, it turns around, I don't control anything anymore.": 1,
    "And you must not try to control, you must let it be.": 1,
    "You don't control anything.": 1,
    "The more you try to control, the more it becomes complicated to manage.": 1,
    " Third, the desire to breathe.": 1,
    "Because yes, I'm not a fish-man, I'm a human being, and the desire to breathe brings me back to this reality.": 1,
    "So, at 60-70 meters,": 1,
    " L'envie devient pr\u00e9sente.": 1,
    " With everything that's happening, it can be very easy to lose your feet and panic.": 1,
    " And now we can say to ourselves, where is the surface?": 1,
    "I want the surface, I want to breathe now.": 1,
    "But don't ever look at the surface, neither with your eyes, nor with your mind.": 1,
    " You have to stay.": 1,
    "Don't project yourself.": 1,
    "Never.": 1,
    "Stay in the present moment.": 1,
    "I keep my eyes right in front of me and the rope.": 1,
    "The rope is the link that brings me back to the surface.": 1,
    "And I stay focused on it, on the present moment.": 1,
    " Because if I want to be on the surface, I panic.": 1,
    "And if I panic, it's over.": 1,
    " The time accelerates.": 1,
    "And at 30 meters, that's it.": 1,
    "Deliverance, I'm not alone anymore.": 1,
    "My safety harnesses, my guardian angels.": 1,
    " me rejoigne.": 1,
    "Il part de la surface, on se retrouve \u00e0 30 m\u00e8tres et il m'escorte dans les derniers m\u00e8tres, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 potentiellement les probl\u00e8mes peuvent arriver.": 1,
    "Et \u00e0 chaque fois je me dis quand je les vois,": 1,
    " It's thanks to you.": 1,
    "It's thanks to them that I'm here.": 1,
    "It's thanks to my team.": 1,
    "It's a second reminder of humility.": 1,
    " Without them, without my team, without all the people around me, the adventure of the depths would be impossible.": 1,
    "The adventure of the depths is collective, above all.": 1,
    "And so I am happy to end this trip with them, because it is thanks to them that I am here.": 1,
    " 20 meters, 10 meters, my lungs slowly find their volume.": 1,
    "Archimedes' push comes with me to the surface.": 1,
    "5 meters before the surface, I start to blow the air to be able to only have to inhale as soon as I get to the surface.": 1,
    "And I get to the surface.": 1,
    " Whoa.": 1,
    " l'air rentre dans mes poumons c'est une renaissance, une d\u00e9livrance.": 1,
    " Because yes, it feels good, the journey is extraordinary, but yes, I need to feel these small molecules of oxygen that come back to feed my body.": 1,
    "It's an extraordinary sensation, but at the same time, it's a small trauma.": 1,
    " C'est un choc pour l'essence.": 1,
    "Vous imaginez ?": 1,
    "Je passe de l'obscurit\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du jour.": 1,
    "Je passe du quasi silence des profondeurs au brouhaha.": 1,
    " In terms of touch, I go from a soft touch of water to the air rubbing my face.": 1,
    "In terms of taste,": 1,
    " At the level of the odor, there is this air that swells in my lungs.": 1,
    "The lungs also deploy in turn.": 1,
    "They were completely crushed a minute and a half before, and there they deploy.": 1,
    " So all of this, it's quite a lot of things.": 1,
    "I need a few seconds to come to myself, to be present.": 1,
    " And yet, it has to be avoided because I have the judges in front of me who are there to validate my performance.": 1,
    "And I have to show them that I am in perfect physical integrity.": 1,
    "As you saw in the video, I do what is called the exit protocol.": 1,
    "As soon as I get out of the water, I have 15 seconds to remove my nose pinch.": 1,
    " make this sign and say I'm OK.": 1,
    "In addition, we ask for bilingualism.": 1,
    "And everything I just did, it's not nice.": 1,
    " Once the protocol is finished, I have the white card of the judges and here is the explosion of joy.": 1,
    "And I can finally really enjoy what just happened.": 1,
    " So the journey I just described is the extreme version of the apnea.": 1,
    "Apnea is not just that, it's far from being just that.": 1,
    " And for two or three years, I've been trying to show a different side of apnea.": 1,
    "Because when we talk about apnea, in the media, we only talk about competitions, about records.": 1,
    "And apnea isn't just that.": 1,
    "Apnea is being in the water, being well in the water.": 1,
    " And Lapn\u00e9e is extremely aesthetic, it's very poetic, it's very artistic.": 1,
    "So we decided, with my partner, to make films to try to show another face.": 1,
    " and to make you want to go in the water.": 1,
    "I'm going to show you these images and I'm going to make my conclusion on these images.": 1,
    " It's a patchwork of beautiful images on the water.": 1,
    " And to tell you that if you ever try to stop breathing, you will realize that stopping breathing is also stopping thinking.": 1,
    "It's calming your mind.": 1,
    " Our mind, in the 21st century, is put to the test.": 1,
    "We are overwhelmed all the time.": 1,
    "We think 10,000 at a time.": 1,
    "We are agitated all the time.": 1,
    "And to be able to put ourselves in apnea is, at some point, to calm this mind.": 1,
    " Se mettre en appel\u00e9e dans l'eau, c'est avoir la chance de go\u00fbter \u00e0 l'apesanteur, \u00eatre sous l'eau, flotter, rel\u00e2cher compl\u00e8tement son corps.": 1,
    " all the tensions of his body.": 1,
    "It's the evil of the 21st century.": 1,
    "We have back pain, we have neck pain, we have pain everywhere because we are all so stressed, we are all not in tension.": 1,
    "You put yourself in the water, you let yourself float, as in space.": 1,
    " and you let yourself go completely.": 1,
    "Extraordinary sensation.": 1,
    "You finally find yourself face to face with your body and with your mind, with your mind.": 1,
    "Everything is at peace, all together.": 1,
    " Being in apnea, learning to do apnea is also learning to breathe well.": 1,
    " We breathe from our first breath to our birth, to our last breath.": 1,
    "Breathing is the rhythm of our life.": 1,
    "Learning to breathe better is learning to live better.": 1,
    " Being in apnea, in the sea, without going 100 meters, go 2-3 meters, put on a mask, put on a pair of palms, it's like looking at another world.": 1,
    " another universe, completely magical, see small fish, see algae, see fauna, flora, and be able to observe that in all discretion.": 1,
    "You slide under water, look, come back to the surface, leave no trace.": 1,
    " It's an extraordinary feeling to be able to work with the element like that.": 1,
    " And if I have to give the final word...": 1,
    " Faire de l'apn\u00e9e, se mettre dans l'eau, retrouver ce milieu aquatique, c'est se reconnecter.": 1,
    "Vous l'avez vu dans la pr\u00e9sentation, j'ai beaucoup parl\u00e9 de cette m\u00e9moire du corps": 1,
    " the millions of years of our aquatic origins, the day you dive back into the water,": 1,
    " for a few seconds, you will reconnect to these origins.": 1,
    "And I guarantee you that it's absolutely magical.": 1,
    "I encourage you to try.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
