    "I don't know what to do.": 10,
    " I don't know what to do.": 5,
    " you": 4,
    "I am a farmer.": 2,
    "I used to go to school with my parents.": 2,
    "Thank you.": 2,
    " I love trees and I'm very lucky because we live near a wonderful arboretum and Sundays usually I go there with my wife and now with my four year old and we climb in the trees, we play hide and seek.": 1,
    " The second school I was at.": 1,
    " had big trees too.": 1,
    "It had a fantastic tulip tree, I think was the biggest in the country.": 1,
    "And it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation around it, around the playing fields.": 1,
    " One day I was grabbed by some of my classmates and taken in the bushes.": 1,
    "I was stripped, I was attacked, I was abused and this came out of the blue.": 1,
    " Now the reason I say that, because afterwards I was thinking, when I went back into the school, I felt dirty, I felt betrayed, I felt ashamed.": 1,
    " Ah, but mainly I felt powerless.": 1,
    " And 30 years later I was sitting in an airplane next to a lady called Veronica who came from Chile and we were on a human rights tour and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured and": 1,
    " from my very privileged position, this was the only reference point that I had.": 1,
    "And it was an amazing learning experience, because for me human rights have been something": 1,
    " which I had, you know, part-time interest, but mainly it was something that happened to other people over there.": 1,
    " But I got a phone call from Bono in 1985 and as you know he's a great singer.": 1,
    " but he's a magnificent hustler.": 1,
    " Very hard guy to say no to, and he was saying, you know, it was after I'd done the Biko song, we're going to do a tour for Amnesty, you have to be on it, and really that was the first time that I'd been out and started meeting people": 1,
    " who'd watched their family being shot in front of them, who'd had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean.": 1,
    "And suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world.": 1,
    " And I couldn't really walk away in quite the same way before.": 1,
    "So I got involved with this tour, which was for Amnesty, and then in 1988 I took over Bono's job.": 1,
    " trying to learn how to hustle.": 1,
    "I didn't do it as well, but we managed to get Eusean Dorstein, Tracy Chapman, and Bruce Springsteen to go around the world for Amnesty, and it was an amazing experience.": 1,
    "And once again, I got": 1,
    " an extraordinary education and it was the first time really that I've met a lot of these people in the different countries and these human rights stories became very physical.": 1,
    " And again, I couldn't really walk away.": 1,
    " quite so comfortably.": 1,
    "But the thing that really amazed me that I had no idea was that you could suffer in this way and then have your whole experience, your story denied, buried,": 1,
    " and forgotten.": 1,
    " And it seemed that whenever there was a camera around...": 1,
    " or a video or film camera, it was a great deal harder to do for those in power.": 1,
    " to uh... bury the story rebox set up a foundation after these human rights tours and uh...": 1,
    " And there was a decision then, we made a proposal for a couple of years about trying to set up a division that was going to give cameras to human rights activists.": 1,
    " It didn't really get anywhere and then the Rodney King incident happened and people thought, okay, if you have a camera in the right place at the right time or perhaps the wrong time, depending who you are, then you can actually": 1,
    " start doing something and campaigning.": 1,
    " and being heard and telling people about what's going on.": 1,
    "So Witness was started in 92 and it's since given": 1,
    " cameras out in over 60 countries and we campaign with activist groups and help them tell their story and in fact": 1,
    " I would show you in a moment one of the most recent campaigns, and I'm afraid it's a story from Uganda.": 1,
    "And although we had a wonderful story from Uganda yesterday, this one isn't quite so good.": 1,
    "And in the north of Uganda": 1,
    " There are something like one and a half million internally displaced people, people who are not refugees in another country, but because of a civil war which has been going on for about 20 years, they have nowhere to live.": 1,
    " 20,000 kids have been taken away to become child soldiers and the International Criminal Court is going after five of the leaders of the": 1,
    " Now, what's it called?": 1,
    "I forget the name of the army.": 1,
    "It's the Lord's Resistance Army, I believe.": 1,
    "But the government also doesn't have a clean sheet, so if we could run the first video.": 1,
    " My name is Karmatigang.": 1,
    " When I was in Burma, I used to go to Burma with my family.": 1,
    " I am a very good person.": 1,
    "I am a very good person.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " When I was a child, I used to go to school with my parents.": 1,
    " So torture is not something that always happens on other soil.": 1,
    "In my country this week we've been looking at pictures of British soldiers beating up young Iraqis.": 1,
    " We've got Abu Ghraib, we've got Guantanamo Bay, and I had a driver on my way to Newark Airport, and he told me a story that in the middle of the night, 4 a.m., he'd been taken out of his home in Queens,": 1,
    " taken to a place in the Midwest that he was interrogated and tortured and returned to the street four weeks later.": 1,
    " because he was a Middle Eastern and he had the same name as one of the 9-11 pilots.": 1,
    " That may or may not be true.": 1,
    "I didn't think he was a liar though.": 1,
    "And I think if we look around the world": 1,
    " As well as the polar ice caps melting, human rights, which have been fought for many hundreds of years in some cases, are also eroding very fast.": 1,
    "And that is something that we need to": 1,
    " take a look at and maybe start campaigning for.": 1,
    "I mean, here to one of our partners was Van Jones and the Books Not Bars project.": 1,
    " They have managed with their footage in California to change the youth correction systems employed.": 1,
    " I think more humane methods are being looked at how you should lock up young kids and that's questionable to start off.": 1,
    " The story of Mr. Morales just down the road.": 1,
    " Excuse me, Mr. Gabriel, would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit?": 1,
    "No, not at all.": 1,
    "No problem.": 1,
    "Take your time.": 1,
    "But this surely": 1,
    " Whoever that man is, whatever he's done this is cruel and unusual punishment.": 1,
    " Anyway, Witness has been trying to arm the brave people who often put their lives at risk around the world with cameras.": 1,
    "And I'd like to show you just a little more of that.": 1,
    " Witness was born of technological innovation in the sense that the small portable DV cam was really what allowed it to come into being.": 1,
    " And we've also been trying to get computers out to the world so that groups can communicate much more effectively, campaign much more effectively.": 1,
    "But now we have the wonderful possibility": 1,
    " which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it.": 1,
    " because that is cheap, it's ubiquitous, and it's moving fast all around the world.": 1,
    "And it's very exciting for us, and so the dream is that we could have a world in which anyone": 1,
    " who has anything bad happen to them of this sort, has a chance of getting their story uploaded, being seen, being watched.": 1,
    " But did they really know that they can be heard?": 1,
    "That there would be a giant website, maybe a little like Google Earth, and you could fly over and find out the realities of what's going for the world's inhabitants in a way.": 1,
    " What this technology is allowing is really that a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face, that we can actually see who's dying of AIDS or who's being beaten up.": 1,
    " for the first time and we can hear their stories and in a way the blogger culture, if we can move that into these sort of fields, I think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways.": 1,
    " There could be a new movement growing up, rising from the ground, reaching for the light, and growing strong, just like a tree.": 1
