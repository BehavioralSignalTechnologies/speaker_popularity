    " So...": 1,
    " We humans have extraordinary potential for goodness.": 1,
    " but also an immense power to do harm.": 1,
    " Any tool can be used to build or to destroy.": 1,
    " That all depends on our motivation.": 1,
    "Therefore, it is all the more important to foster an altruistic motivation rather than a selfish one.": 1,
    " So now we indeed are facing many challenges in our times.": 1,
    " Those could be personal challenges.": 1,
    "Our own mind can be our best friend, our worst enemy.": 1,
    " There are also societal challenges, poverty in the midst of plenty, inequalities, conflict, injustice.": 1,
    "And then there are new challenges, which we don't expect.": 1,
    " 10,000 years ago, there was about five million human beings on Earth.": 1,
    " Whatever they could do, the Earth's resilience will soon heal human activities.": 1,
    " after the industrial and technological revolution, that's not the same anymore.": 1,
    "We are now the major agent of impact on our earth.": 1,
    "We enter the Anthropocene, the era of human beings.": 1,
    " So in a way, if we were to say we need to continue this endless growth, endless use of": 1,
    " material resources.": 1,
    "It's like saying, if this man was saying, and I heard a former head of state, I won't mention who, saying five years ago, we were at the edge of the precipice, today we made a big step forward.": 1,
    " So this edge.": 1,
    " is the same which has been defined by scientists as the planetary boundaries.": 1,
    "And with these, those boundaries taking care of a number of factors,": 1,
    " we can still prosper, humanity can still prosper for 150,000 years if we keep the same stability of climate as in the Holocene for the last 10,000 years.": 1,
    "But this depends": 1,
    " on choosing a voluntary simplicity, growing qualitatively, not quantitatively.": 1,
    "So in 1900, as you can see, we were well within the limits of safety.": 1,
    "Now,": 1,
    " In 1950 came the great acceleration.": 1,
    " Now hold your breath, not too long, to imagine what comes next, now.": 1,
    " we have vastly overrun some of the planetary boundaries.": 1,
    "Just to take biodiversity, at the current rate, in 2050, 30% of all species on earth will have disappeared.": 1,
    " Even if we keep that DNA in some fridge, that's not going to be reversible.": 1,
    " So here I am sitting in front of a 7,000 meters high, 21,000 feet glacier in Bhutan.": 1,
    "The third pole, 2,000 glaciers are melting fast, faster than the Arctic.": 1,
    " So what can we do in that situation?": 1,
    " Well.": 1,
    " However complex, politically, economically, scientifically, the question of the environment is, it simply boils down to a question of altruism versus selfishness.": 1,
    " I'm a Marxist of the Groucho tendency.": 1,
    " Groucho Marx said, why should I care for future generation?": 1,
    "What did they do for me?": 1,
    " Unfortunately, I heard...": 1,
    " The billionaire Stephen Forbes on Fox News said exactly the same thing, but seriously.": 1,
    "He was told about the rise of the ocean and he said, I find it absurd to change my behavior today for something that will happen in 100 years.": 1,
    " So if you don't care for future generation, just go for it.": 1,
    " So one of the main challenges of our times is to reconcile three times scale.": 1,
    "The short term of the economy, the ups and downs of the stock market, the end of the year accounts.": 1,
    "The midterm of the quality of life.": 1,
    " What is the quality every moment of our life and over 10 years and 20 years?": 1,
    " the long term of the environment.": 1,
    "When environmentally speak with economies, it's like a schizophrenic dialogue, completely incoherent, they don't speak the same language.": 1,
    " Not for the last 10 years, I went around the world meeting economists, scientists, neuroscientists, environmentalists, philosophers, thinkers in the Himalayas, all over the place.": 1,
    " It seems to me there's only one concept that can reconcile those three timescales.": 1,
    "It is simply having more consideration for others.": 1,
    " If you have more consideration for others, you will have a caring economics where finances are the service of society and not society as the service of finances.": 1,
    " You will not play at the casino with the resources that people haven't trusted you with.": 1,
    " If you are more considerate for others, you will make sure that you remedy to inequality, that you bring some kind of well-being within society, in education, at the workplace, otherwise.": 1,
    " a nation that is the most powerful and the richest, everyone is miserable, what's the point?": 1,
    "And if you are more consideration for others, you are not going to rank-sack that planet that we have.": 1,
    "And at current rate, we don't have three planets to continue that way.": 1,
    " So the question is, okay, altruism is the answer.": 1,
    "It's not just a noble ideal, but can it be a real pragmatic solution?": 1,
    " And first of all, does it exist?": 1,
    "True altruism?": 1,
    "Or are we so selfish?": 1,
    "So some philosophers thought that we were irremediably selfish.": 1,
    " But are we really all just like vascals?": 1,
    " That's good news, isn't it?": 1,
    " Many philosophers like Hobbes have said so.": 1,
    "Well, not everyone just looks like a rascal.": 1,
    "Or is man a wolf or man?": 1,
    "This guy doesn't seem too bad.": 1,
    " He's one of my friends in Tibet.": 1,
    "He's very kind.": 1,
    "So now, we love cooperation.": 1,
    "There's no greater joy than work together, isn't it?": 1,
    "And then not only humans.": 1,
    " And then, of course, there's the struggle for life, the survival of the feastness, social Darwinisms.": 1,
    " But in evolution, cooperation, though competition exists of course, cooperation has to be much more creative to go to an increased level of complexity.": 1,
    "We are super cooperators and we should even go further.": 1,
    " So now, on top of that, the quality of human relationship": 1,
    " The OCD did a survey among ten factors, including income, everything.": 1,
    "The first one that people said that meant for my happiness is quality of social relationship.": 1,
    "Not only in humans.": 1,
    " And look at those great grandmothers.": 1,
    " So now...": 1,
    " This idea that if you go deep within, we are irremediably selfish.": 1,
    "This is harm-chair science.": 1,
    "There is not a single sociological study, psychological study, ever shown that.": 1,
    "Why not the opposite?": 1,
    " My friend Daniel Batson spent her whole life putting people in the lab in very complex situations.": 1,
    "And of course, we have sometimes selfish and some people more than others.": 1,
    " But he found that systematically, no matter what, there's a significant number of people who do behave altruistically no matter what.": 1,
    " If you see someone deeply wounded, great suffering, you might just help out of empathic distress.": 1,
    "You can't stand it, so it's better to help than keep on looking at that person.": 1,
    "So he tested all that, and in the end he said,": 1,
    " Clearly, people can be altruistic, so that's good news.": 1,
    "And even further, we should look at the banality of goodness.": 1,
    " Look at here.": 1,
    "When we come out, we're not going to say, that's so nice.": 1,
    "There was no feast fight while those monks were speaking about altruism.": 1,
    "No, we expect that, isn't it?": 1,
    "If there was a feast fight, we will speak of that for months.": 1,
    " So the banality of goodness is something that doesn't attract your attention, but it exists.": 1,
    " Look at this.": 1,
    " Okay.": 1,
    " So some psychologists said, when I tell them I run 140 humanitarian projects in the Himalayas, that gives me so much joy.": 1,
    "They say, oh, I see.": 1,
    "You work for the warm glow.": 1,
    "This is not altruistic.": 1,
    "You just feel good.": 1,
    " You think this guy, when he jumped in front of the train, he thought, I'm going to feel so good when this is over.": 1,
    " But that's not the end of it.": 1,
    "They say, well, but when you interviewed him, he said, I had no choice.": 1,
    "I had to jump, of course.": 1,
    "He said, no choice.": 1,
    "Automatic behavior is neither selfish nor altruistic.": 1,
    "No choice.": 1,
    " Well, of course, this guy's not going to think for half an hour, should I give my hand, not give my hand.": 1,
    "He does it.": 1,
    "There is a choice, but it's obvious it's immediate.": 1,
    " And then also, he had a choice.": 1,
    " So now there are people who had choice, like Pastor Andre Tromey and his wife, and the whole village of Chambord-Soligno in France.": 1,
    "For the whole Second World War, they saved 3,500 Jews.": 1,
    " give them shelter, brought them to Switzerland against all odds at the risk of their life and that of their family.": 1,
    "So altruism does exist.": 1,
    "So what is altruism?": 1,
    " is the wish, may others be happy and find the cause of happiness.": 1,
    "Now, empathy is the affective resonance or cognitive resonance that tells you, this person is joyful, this person suffers.": 1,
    "But empathy enough is not sufficient.": 1,
    " If you keep on being confronted with suffering, you might have empathic distress, burnout.": 1,
    "So you need the greater sphere of loving kindness.": 1,
    " With Tanya Singer at the Max Planck Institute of Life Sick, we showed that the brain network for empathy and loving-kindness are different.": 1,
    "Now that's all well done, so we got that from": 1,
    " evolution through maternal care, parental love, but we need to extend that.": 1,
    "It can be extended even to other species.": 1,
    " Now, if we want a more altruistic society, we need two things, individual change and societal change.": 1,
    "So is individual change possible?": 1,
    "Two thousand years of contemplative studies said yes, it is.": 1,
    " Now, 15 years of collaboration with neuroscience and epigenetics is a yes.": 1,
    "Our brain changed when you train in altruism.": 1,
    " So I spent 120 hours in MRI machine.": 1,
    "This is the first time I went after two and a half hours.": 1,
    " And the results have been published in many scientific papers.": 1,
    "It shows without ambiguity that there are structural change and functional change in the brain when you train altruistic love.": 1,
    " Just to give you an idea, this is the meditators at rest on the left.": 1,
    "Meditation in compassion meditation, you see all the activity.": 1,
    "And then the control group at rest, nothing happened.": 1,
    "In meditation, nothing happened.": 1,
    "They have not been trained.": 1,
    " So do you need 50,000 hours of meditation?": 1,
    "No, you don't.": 1,
    "Four weeks, 20 minutes a day of caring mindfulness meditation already brings": 1,
    " a structural change in the brain compared to a control group.": 1,
    "That's only 20 minutes a day for four weeks.": 1,
    " Even with preschoolers, Richard Davidson did that in Madison.": 1,
    "Eight weeks program, gratitude, loving kindness, cooperation, mindful breathing.": 1,
    "You would say, oh, there's just preschoolers.": 1,
    "Look after eight weeks.": 1,
    " The pro-social behavior, that's the blue line.": 1,
    "And then comes the ultimate scientific test, the stickers test.": 1,
    " Before you determine for each child who is their best friend in the class, their least favorite child, an unknown child, and a sick child, and they have to give stickers away.": 1,
    " So before the intervention, they give most of it to their best friend.": 1,
    "Four, five years old, 20 minutes, three times a week.": 1,
    "After the intervention, no more discrimination.": 1,
    "The same amount of stickers to their best friend and their least favorite child.": 1,
    " That's something we should do in all the schools in the world.": 1,
    "Now, where do we go from there?": 1,
    " When the Dalai Lama heard that, he told Richard Davidson, you go 10 schools, 100 schools, the UN, the whole world.": 1,
    "So now where do we go from there?": 1,
    "Individual change is possible.": 1,
    " Now, do we have to wait for an altruistic gene to be in the human race?": 1,
    "That will take 50,000 years, too much for the environment.": 1,
    "Fortunately,": 1,
    " there is the evolution of culture.": 1,
    "Cultures, as specialists have shown, change faster than genes.": 1,
    "That's the good news.": 1,
    "Look, attitude towards war has dramatically changed over the years.": 1,
    " So now, individual change and cultural change mutually fashion each other, and yes, we can achieve a more altruistic society.": 1,
    "So where do we go from there?": 1,
    "Myself, I'll go back to the East.": 1,
    " Now we treat 100,000 patients a year in our projects.": 1,
    "We have 25,000 kids in school, 4% overhead.": 1,
    "Some people say, well, your staff works in practice, but does it work in theory?": 1,
    "So they call us a positive deviance.": 1,
    " So I also go back to my hermitage to find the inner resources to better serve others.": 1,
    "But on a more global level, what can we do?": 1,
    "We need treatings, enhancing cooperation.": 1,
    " Cooperative learning in the school instead of competitive learning.": 1,
    "Unconditional cooperation within corporation.": 1,
    "There can be some competition between corporations, but not within.": 1,
    " We need sustainable harmony.": 1,
    "I love this term.": 1,
    "Not sustainable growth anymore.": 1,
    "Sustainable harmony means now we reduce inequality in the future.": 1,
    " We do more with less and we continue to grow qualitatively, not quantitatively.": 1,
    "We need a caring economics.": 1,
    " The Homo economicus cannot deal with poverty in the midst of plenty, cannot deal with the common goods of the atmosphere of the ocean,": 1,
    " We need a caring economics.": 1,
    "If you say economics should be compassionate, this is not our job.": 1,
    "But if you say they don't care, that looks bad.": 1,
    " We need local commitment, global responsibility.": 1,
    " We need to extend altruism to the other 1.6 other species, sentient beings, our co-citizens in this world.": 1,
    "And we need to dare altruism.": 1,
    " So long life to the altruistic revolution.": 1,
    "Viva la revolution de altruismo.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
