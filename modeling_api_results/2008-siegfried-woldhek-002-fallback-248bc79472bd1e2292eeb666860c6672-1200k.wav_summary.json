    " Good morning.": 1,
    "Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci.": 1,
    "We're all familiar with his fantastic work, his drawings, his paintings, his inventions, his writings.": 1,
    " But we do not know his face.": 1,
    "Thousands of books have been written about him.": 1,
    "But there's controversy, and it remains about his looks.": 1,
    " Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians.": 1,
    "So what do you think?": 1,
    "Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it?": 1,
    "Let's find out.": 1,
    " Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him.": 1,
    "He drew people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everything.": 1,
    "But no faces.": 1,
    " I find that hard to believe.": 1,
    "His contemporaries made faces like the ones you see here, en face of three quarters.": 1,
    "So surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo must have made self-portraits from time to time.": 1,
    " So let's try to find him.": 1,
    "I think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us.": 1,
    " So I looked at all of his drawings, more than 700, and looked for male portraits.": 1,
    "There are about 120.": 1,
    "You see them here.": 1,
    " Which ones of these could be self-portraits?": 1,
    "Well, for that, they have to be done as we just saw, en face or three-quarters.": 1,
    "So we can eliminate all the profiles.": 1,
    " it also has to be sufficiently detailed.": 1,
    "So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized.": 1,
    " And we know from his contemporaries that Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man.": 1,
    "So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures.": 1,
    " And look what happens.": 1,
    "Only three candidates remain that fit the bill.": 1,
    "And here they are.": 1,
    " Yes, indeed the old man is there, as is this famous pen drawing of the home of Vitruvianes.": 1,
    "And lastly, the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted, the musician.": 1,
    " Before we go into these faces, I should explain why I have some right to talk about them.": 1,
    "I've made more than 1,100 portraits myself for newspapers over the course of 30 years only.": 1,
    " But there are 1100 and very few artists have drawn so many faces, so I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces.": 1,
    "Okay, now let's look at these three portraits and hold on to your seats because if we zoom in on those faces,": 1,
    " Remark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows, the long nose, the curved lips and the small well-developed chin.": 1,
    " I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that.": 1,
    "There was no reason why these portraits should look alike.": 1,
    "All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait, and look, they do are very similar.": 1,
    " Are they made in the right order?": 1,
    "The young men should be made first.": 1,
    "And as you see here from the years that they were created, it is indeed the case.": 1,
    "They are made in the right order.": 1,
    " What was the age of Leonardo at the time?": 1,
    "Does that fit?": 1,
    "Yes, it does.": 1,
    "He was 33, 38 and 63 when these were made.": 1,
    "So we have three pictures, potentially of the same person, of the same age as Leonardo at the time.": 1,
    " But how do we know it's him and not someone else?": 1,
    "Well, we need a reference.": 1,
    "And here's the only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted.": 1,
    " It's a statue made by Verrocchio of David for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15.": 1,
    "And if we now compare the face of the statue with the face of the musician.": 1,
    " you see the very same features again.": 1,
    "The statue is the reference and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three faces.": 1,
    "Ladies and gentlemen.": 1,
    " This story has not yet been published.": 1,
    "It's only proper that you hear it said, hear and see it first.": 1,
    "The icon of icons finally has a face.": 1,
    "Here he is, Leonardo da Vinci.": 1
