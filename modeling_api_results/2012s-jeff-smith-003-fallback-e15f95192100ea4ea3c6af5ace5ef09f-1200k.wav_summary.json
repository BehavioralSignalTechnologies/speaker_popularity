    " BJ was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future.": 1,
    "He had a vision.": 1,
    "When he got out, he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight.": 1,
    "And he was actually": 1,
    " working on merging his two passions into one vision.": 1,
    "He'd spent $10,000 to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars.": 1,
    " It was my first week in federal prison, and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV.": 1,
    "In fact, it was teaming with smart, ambitious men.": 1,
    " whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the CEOs who had wined and dined me six months earlier when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate.": 1,
    " Now, 95% of the guys that I was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside.": 1,
    "But when they talked about what they did,": 1,
    " They talked about it in a different jargon, but the business concepts that they talked about weren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton.": 1,
    "Promotional incentives, you never charge a first time user.": 1,
    " focus grouping, new product launches, territorial expansion.": 1,
    "But they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days.": 1,
    "For the most part, everyone was just trying to survive.": 1,
    " It's a lot harder than you might think.": 1,
    "Contrary to what most people think, taxpayers don't pay for your life when you're in prison.": 1,
    "You gotta pay for your own life.": 1,
    "You gotta pay for your soap, your deodorant.": 1,
    " toothbrush, toothpaste, all of it.": 1,
    "And it's hard for a couple of reasons.": 1,
    "First, everything's marked up 30 to 50% from what you'd pay in the street.": 1,
    "And second, you don't make a lot of money.": 1,
    "I unloaded trucks.": 1,
    "That was my full-time job, unloading trucks at a food warehouse.": 1,
    " for $5.25, not an hour, but per month.": 1,
    " So how do you survive?": 1,
    "We learn to hustle.": 1,
    " There's all kinds of hustles.": 1,
    "There's legal hustles.": 1,
    "You pay everything in stamps.": 1,
    "Those are the currency.": 1,
    "You charge another inmate to clean his cell.": 1,
    "There's sort of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell.": 1,
    " There's pretty illegal hustles.": 1,
    "You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell.": 1,
    "And there's very illegal hustles, which you get smuggled in.": 1,
    " drugs, pornography, cell phones.": 1,
    "And just as in the outer world, there's a risk-reward trade-off.": 1,
    "So the riskier the enterprise, the more profitable it can potentially be.": 1,
    "You want a cigarette in prison?": 1,
    "Three to five dollars.": 1,
    " You want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open and it's about as big as your head?": 1,
    "300 bucks.": 1,
    "You want a dirty magazine?": 1,
    "Well, it can be as much as $1,000.": 1,
    " So as you can probably tell, one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity.": 1,
    " whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse.": 1,
    " sculpting people's hair with toenail clippers.": 1,
    " or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs, prisoners learn how to make do with less.": 1,
    "And many of them want to take this ingenuity that they've learned to the outside.": 1,
    " and start restaurants, barbershops, personal training businesses.": 1,
    "But there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that, no rehabilitation at all in prison.": 1,
    "No one to help them write a business plan.": 1,
    " figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises, no access to the internet even.": 1,
    " And then when they come out, most states don't even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background.": 1,
    " So none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend within five years.": 1,
    " Look, I lied to the feds.": 1,
    "I lost a year of my life from it.": 1,
    "But when I came out,": 1,
    " I vowed that I was gonna do whatever I could to make sure that guys like the ones I was locked up with didn't have to waste any more of their life than they already had.": 1,
    " So I hope that you'll think about helping in some way.": 1,
    "The best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons.": 1,
    "Because if we don't,": 1,
    " They're not gonna learn any new skills that's gonna help them and they'll be right back.": 1,
    "All they'll learn on the inside is new hustles.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
