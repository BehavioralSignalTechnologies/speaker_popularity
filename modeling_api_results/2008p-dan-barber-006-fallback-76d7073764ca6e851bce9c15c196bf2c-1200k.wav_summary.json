    "Amazing.": 2,
    " I went to Spain a few months ago.": 1,
    " I had": 1,
    " the best foie gras of my life, the best culinary experience of my life.": 1,
    " Because what I saw, I'm convinced, is the future of cooking.": 1,
    " Ridiculous, right?": 1,
    "I mean foie gras and future of cooking, there's not a food today that's more maligned than foie gras, right?": 1,
    "I mean, it's crucified.": 1,
    "It was outlawed in Chicago for a while.": 1,
    "It's pending here in California and just recently.": 1,
    " in New York.": 1,
    "It's like if you're a chef and you put it on your menu, you risk being attacked.": 1,
    " Really, it happened here in San Francisco to a famous chef.": 1,
    "I'm not saying that": 1,
    " that there's not a rationale for being opposed to foie gras.": 1,
    "The reasons usually just whittle down to the gavage, which is the force feeding.": 1,
    "Basically, you take a goose or a duck and you...": 1,
    " you force feed a ton of grain down his throat.": 1,
    "More grain in a couple weeks than it would ever get in a lifetime.": 1,
    "It's liver.": 1,
    " expands by eight times.": 1,
    "Suffice to say, it's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming.": 1,
    "The problem for us chefs is that it's so freaking delicious.": 1,
    " I mean, I love the stuff.": 1,
    "It is fatty, it's sweet, it's silky, it's unctuous.": 1,
    " It makes everything else you put it with taste incredible.": 1,
    "Can we produce a menu that's delicious without Farga?": 1,
    "Yeah, sure.": 1,
    " You can also bike the Tour de France without steroids, right?": 1,
    " Yeah.": 1,
    " Not a lot of people are doing it, and for good reason.": 1,
    " So a couple months ago, a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy, Eduardo Souza.": 1,
    "Eduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras.": 1,
    " Natural Farga.": 1,
    "What's natural about Farga?": 1,
    " to take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall, geese and ducks gorge on food to prepare for the harsh realities of winter.": 1,
    " And the rest of the year, they're free to roam around Eduardo's land and eat what they want.": 1,
    "So no gavage, no force feeding, no factory-like conditions, no cruelty.": 1,
    " And it's shockingly not a new idea.": 1,
    "His great granddad started Pateria de Sousa in 1812.": 1,
    "And they've been doing it quietly ever since.": 1,
    " That is, until last year.": 1,
    " when Eduardo won the coup de coeur.": 1,
    " the coveted French gastronomic prize.": 1,
    " It's like the Olympics of food products.": 1,
    "He placed first for his foie gras.": 1,
    " Big, big problem.": 1,
    "As he said to me, that really pissed the French off.": 1,
    " Said it sort of gleefully.": 1,
    " It was all over the papers, and I read about it.": 1,
    "It was in Le Monde.": 1,
    "Spanish chef accused, and the French accused him, Spanish chef accused of cheating.": 1,
    "They accused him of paying off the judges.": 1,
    " They implicated, actually, the Spanish government.": 1,
    "Amazingly.": 1,
    "Huh?": 1,
    "Huge scandal for a few weeks.": 1,
    "Couldn't find a shred of evidence.": 1,
    "Look at the guy.": 1,
    "He doesn't look like a guy who's paying off French judges for his far out.": 1,
    " So die down, and then very soon afterwards, new controversy.": 1,
    " He shouldn't win because it's not foie gras.": 1,
    " It's not Fargad because it's not gavage.": 1,
    "It's all force feeding.": 1,
    "So by definition, he's lying and should be disqualified.": 1,
    " As funny as it sounds, articulating now and reading about it, actually, if you had, we had talked about it before, this controversy, I would have said, that's kind of true.": 1,
    "You know, foie gras, by definition, you know, force-feeding, it's gavage, and that's what you get when you...": 1,
    " when you want Fargo.": 1,
    " That is until I went to...": 1,
    " Eduardo's farm in Extremadura, 50 miles north of Sevilla, right on the Portugal border.": 1,
    "I saw firsthand a system that is incredibly complex and then, at the same time,": 1,
    " Everything beautiful in nature is utterly simple.": 1,
    " And he said to me, really from the first moment, my MO, my life's work.": 1,
    " is to give the geese what they want.": 1,
    "He repeated that about 50 times in the two days I was with him.": 1,
    "I'm just here to give the geese what they want.": 1,
    " Actually, when I showed up, he was lying down with the geese with his cell phone, taking pictures of them, like his children in the grass.": 1,
    "He's really just in love with it.": 1,
    "He's at one with it.": 1,
    "He's the goose whisperer.": 1,
    " And when I was speaking to him,": 1,
    " I thought, Mike, I'm speaking to you now, right?": 1,
    "But in the middle of my questions, my excited questions, because the more I got to know him and his system, the more excited this whole idea became.": 1,
    "He kept going like this to me.": 1,
    " And I thought, OK, excited Jew from New York, right?": 1,
    "I'm talking a little too aggressively, whatever.": 1,
    "So I slowed down.": 1,
    "And by the end of the day, I was like,": 1,
    " Eduardo, you know like this?": 1,
    "But he's still going like this.": 1,
    " And I figured it out.": 1,
    " And I'm speaking too loudly.": 1,
    " So I hushed my voice.": 1,
    "I kind of like asked these questions and chatted with them through a translator in kind of half whisper.": 1,
    " And he stopped doing this, and amazingly, the geese who were on the other side of the paddock when I was around, get the hell away from this kid, when I lowered my voice, they all came right up to us.": 1,
    " right up to us, like right up to here, right along the fence line.": 1,
    "And the fence line was amazing in and of itself.": 1,
    "This conception of fence that we have, it's totally backward with him.": 1,
    "The electricity on this fiberglass fence is only on the outside.": 1,
    " He rewired it.": 1,
    "He invented it.": 1,
    "I've never seen it.": 1,
    "Have you?": 1,
    "You fence in animals.": 1,
    "You electrify the inside.": 1,
    "He doesn't.": 1,
    "He electrifies only the outside.": 1,
    " Why?": 1,
    "Because he said to me that he felt like the geese, and he proved this actually, not just...": 1,
    " not just to concede, he proved this, that the geese felt manipulated when they were": 1,
    " when they are imprisoned in their little paddock.": 1,
    " even though they're imprisoned in this garden of Eden with figs and olives and everything else, he felt like they felt manipulated.": 1,
    "So he got rid of the electricity, got rid of the current on the inside, and kept it on the outside so to protect them against coyotes and other predators.": 1,
    " And what happened?": 1,
    "They ate, and he showed me on a chart how they ate about 20% more.": 1,
    " feed to feed their levers.": 1,
    " The landscape is incredible.": 1,
    "I mean, his farm is incredible.": 1,
    "It really is the Garden of Eden, this figs and olives and everything else there for the taking.": 1,
    "And it's the irony of irony is because extra madora, the area, what does extra madora mean?": 1,
    "Extra hard land.": 1,
    " Extra difficult, extra hard.": 1,
    "But over four generations, he and his family have literally transformed this extra hard land into a tasting menu.": 1,
    " of great delights for these geese.": 1,
    "And they are allowed to take whatever they want.": 1,
    "Another irony, the double irony, is that on the figs and the olives, Eduardo can make more money selling those than he can the foie gras.": 1,
    "He doesn't care.": 1,
    " He lets them take what they want and he says, usually it's about 50%.": 1,
    "They're very fair.": 1,
    "The other 50% he takes and he sells and he makes money on.": 1,
    "Part of the income for his farm.": 1,
    "A big part of his income for his farm.": 1,
    "But he never controls it.": 1,
    " They get what they want, they leave the rest for me and I sell it.": 1,
    "His biggest obstacle, really, was the marketplace, which demands these days bright yellow foie gras.": 1,
    " That's how I've been trained.": 1,
    "You want to look and see what good Fargah is.": 1,
    "It's got to be bright yellow.": 1,
    "It's the indication that is.": 1,
    " best foie gras.": 1,
    "Well, because he doesn't force feed, because he doesn't gavage tons of corn,": 1,
    " his livers were pretty gray, or they were.": 1,
    " But he found this wild plant called the lupin bush.": 1,
    "Lupin bush, it's all around extramodora.": 1,
    " He let it go to seed, he took the seeds, he planted it on his 30 acres, all around.": 1,
    "And the geese love the lupine bush, not for the bush, but for the seeds.": 1,
    "And when they eat the seeds, their foie gras turns yellow.": 1,
    " radioactive yellow, bright yellow.": 1,
    " of the highest quality foie gras yellow I've ever seen.": 1,
    " So I'm listening to all this, and I'm like...": 1,
    " Is this guy for real?": 1,
    "Is he making some of this up?": 1,
    "Because he seemed to have an answer for everything and it was always nature.": 1,
    "It was never him.": 1,
    " I don't know, I get a little weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves because they want you to look at themselves, but he deflected everything away from his ingenuity into": 1,
    " into working with his landscape.": 1,
    "So it's like, you know, here I am on the fence about this guy, but increasingly...": 1,
    " Eating up is every word.": 1,
    "And we're sitting there and I hear...": 1,
    " like from a distance, I look over, and he grabs my arm, and the translator says, ducks us under bushes, watch this, shh, says again, for the 500th time to me, shh, watch this.": 1,
    " squadron of geese come over and they're loud getting louder louder louder like really loud right over us and like airport traffic control": 1,
    " As they start to go past us, they're called back.": 1,
    "And they're called back and back and back.": 1,
    "And then they circle around.": 1,
    "And his geese are calling up now to the wild geese.": 1,
    "And the wild geese are calling down.": 1,
    " And it's getting louder and louder and then they circle and circle and they land.": 1,
    "And I'm just like, no way.": 1,
    " No way.": 1,
    "I look at Eduardo, who's near tears, looking at this.": 1,
    " And I say, you're telling me that your geese are calling to the wild geese to say, come for a visit?": 1,
    "And he says, no, no, no.": 1,
    "They come to stay.": 1,
    " Come to stay.": 1,
    " It's like the DNA of a goose is to fly south in the winter, right?": 1,
    "I said that.": 1,
    "I said, isn't that what they're put on this earth for?": 1,
    "Fly south in the winter and north when it gets warm?": 1,
    "I said, no, no, no.": 1,
    " Their DNA is to find the conditions that are conducive to life, to happiness.": 1,
    " They find it here.": 1,
    "They don't need anything more.": 1,
    " They stop, they mate with his domesticated geese, and his flock continues.": 1,
    " Think about that for a minute.": 1,
    "That's brilliant, right?": 1,
    "Imagine a hog farm in North Carolina and a wild pig comes upon a factory farm and decides to stay.": 1,
    " So how did it taste?": 1,
    "We finally got to taste it before I left.": 1,
    "He took me to his neighborhood restaurant and he served me some of his farra, confit farra.": 1,
    " It was incredible.": 1,
    "And the problem with saying that, of course, is that at this point, it risks hyperbole really easily.": 1,
    "And I'd like to make a metaphor, but I don't have one really.": 1,
    " I was drinking this guy's Kool-Aid so much, he could have served me goose feathers, and I would have been like, this guy's a genius.": 1,
    "I'm really in love with him at this point.": 1,
    " But it truly was the best foie gras of my life, so much so that I don't think I had ever really had foie gras until that moment.": 1,
    "I had something that was called foie gras.": 1,
    "But this was transformative, really transformative.": 1,
    "And I say to you,": 1,
    " I might not stick to this, but I don't think I'll ever serve foie gras on my menu again.": 1,
    " because of that.": 1,
    " Taste Experience with Eduardo.": 1,
    " It was sweet, it was anxious, it had all the qualities of foie gras, but it's fat, it had a lot of integrity.": 1,
    " a lot of honesty, and you could taste.": 1,
    " herbs, you could taste spices.": 1,
    "And I kept saying, I said, you know, I swear to God I tasted star anise.": 1,
    " I was sure of it.": 1,
    "And I'm not like some super taster, you know, but I like, I go, I can taste things.": 1,
    "There's a hundred percent, sorry, no.": 1,
    "And I started like going down the spices and finally I was like, okay, salt and pepper.": 1,
    " thinking he salted and peppered his liver.": 1,
    "But no, he takes the liver when he harvests the foie gras, he sticks them in this jar, and he confuses it.": 1,
    "No salt, no pepper, no oil, no spices.": 1,
    "What?": 1,
    " He said, we went back out for the final tour of the farm.": 1,
    "And he showed me the wild pepper plants and the plants that he made sure exist on his farm for salinity.": 1,
    " He doesn't need salt and pepper, and he doesn't need spices because he's got this potpourri of herbs and flavors.": 1,
    " that his geese love to gorge on.": 1,
    " I turned to him at the end of the meal, and it's a question I'd asked several times, and he hadn't answered me directly, but I said at the end of the meal, you know, look, you're in Spain.": 1,
    "Some of the greatest chefs in the world are in Spain.": 1,
    " preeminent chef of the world today, not that far from you.": 1,
    " How come you don't give him this?": 1,
    "How come no one's really heard of you?": 1,
    " And it may be because of the wine or maybe because of my excitement, he answered me directly and he said,": 1,
    " because chefs don't deserve my foie gras.": 1,
    " And he was right.": 1,
    "He was right.": 1,
    "Chefs take foie gras and they make it their own.": 1,
    "They create a dish where all the vectors point at us.": 1,
    " with Eduardo.": 1,
    " It's about the expression of nature.": 1,
    "And as he said, I think, fittingly,": 1,
    " It's a gift from God.": 1,
    " with God saying, you've done good work.": 1,
    "Simple.": 1,
    " I flew home.": 1,
    "I'm on the flight with my little black book.": 1,
    "I took pages and pages of notes about him.": 1,
    "I really was moved.": 1,
    "And in the corner of one of my notes,": 1,
    " is this note that says, when asked, what do you think of conventional Fargo?": 1,
    "What do you think of Fargo that 99.99% of the world eats?": 1,
    "He said, I think it's an insult to history.": 1,
    " And I wrote, insult the history.": 1,
    "And I'm on the plane and I'm just tearing my hair.": 1,
    "It's like, why didn't I fall up in that?": 1,
    "What the hell does that mean?": 1,
    "Insult the history.": 1,
    " So I did some research when I got back.": 1,
    " And here's what I found, the history of Fargah.": 1,
    "Jews invented Fargah.": 1,
    " True story, true story, by accident.": 1,
    " They were looking for an alternative to schmaltz.": 1,
    " gotten sick of the chicken fat.": 1,
    "And they saw in the fall that there was this natural, beautiful, sweet, delicious fat from geese.": 1,
    " And they slaughtered them and used the fat throughout the winter for cooking.": 1,
    "The pharaoh got wind of this.": 1,
    "This is true.": 1,
    "Right off the internet.": 1,
    " I swear to God.": 1,
    " But Pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it.": 1,
    "He tasted it and fell in love with it.": 1,
    "He started demanding it.": 1,
    "And he didn't want it just in the fall.": 1,
    "He wanted it all year round.": 1,
    "And he demanded that the Jews supply enough for everyone.": 1,
    " and the Jews fearing for their life had to come up with an ingenious idea or at least try and satisfy the Pharaoh's wishes, of course.": 1,
    "And they invented what?": 1,
    "Gavage.": 1,
    "They invented Gavage.": 1,
    " in a great moment of fear for their lives.": 1,
    " And they provided the Pharaoh with gavaged liver and the good stuff they kept for themselves, supposedly.": 1,
    "Anyway, I believe that one.": 1,
    " That's the history of foie gras.": 1,
    "And if you think about it...": 1,
    " It's the history of industrial agriculture.": 1,
    "It's the history of what we eat today.": 1,
    " most of what we eat today.": 1,
    "Megafarms, feedlots, chemical amendments, long distance travel, food processing, all of it, our food system.": 1,
    "That's also an insult to history.": 1,
    " It's an insult to the basic laws of nature and of biology.": 1,
    " Whether we're talking about beef cattle, or we're talking about chickens, or we're talking about broccoli, or Brussels sprouts, or, in the case of this morning's New York Times, catfish.": 1,
    " Which?": 1,
    " wholesale going out of business.": 1,
    "Whatever it is, it's a mindset that is reminiscent of General Motors.": 1,
    " It's rooted in extraction.": 1,
    " Take more, sell more, waste more.": 1,
    " And for the future, it won't serve us.": 1,
    "Jonas Salk has a great quote.": 1,
    "He said, if all the insects disappeared, life on Earth as we know it would disappear within 50 years.": 1,
    " If human beings disappeared, life on Earth as we know it would flourish.": 1,
    " And he's right.": 1,
    " We need now to adopt": 1,
    " a new conception of agriculture.": 1,
    "Really new.": 1,
    "One in which we stop treating the planet as if it were some kind of business and liquidation.": 1,
    " and stop degrading resources under the guise of cheap food.": 1,
    " We can start by looking to farmers like Eduardo, farmers that rely on nature for solutions for answers, rather than imposing solutions on nature.": 1,
    " Listening, as Janine Banuels, one of my favorite writers and thinkers about this topic, says, listening to nature's operating instructions.": 1,
    " That's what Eduardo does and does so brilliantly.": 1,
    "And what he showed me and what he can show all of us, I think, is that the great things, the great thing for chefs, the great blessing for chefs.": 1,
    " and for people that care about food and cooking.": 1,
    " is that the most ecological choice for food is also the most ethical choice for food, whether we're talking about Brussels sprouts or foie gras.": 1,
    " And it's also almost always, and I haven't found an example otherwise, but almost always the most delicious choice.": 1,
    " That's serendipitous.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
