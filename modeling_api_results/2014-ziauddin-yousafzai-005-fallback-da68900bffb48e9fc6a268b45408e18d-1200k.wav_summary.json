    " Dear brothers and sisters,": 2,
    " In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies, fathers are usually known by their sons.": 1,
    " but I'm one of the few fathers who is known by his daughter and I'm proud of it.": 1,
    " Malala started her campaign for education and stood for her rights in 2007.": 1,
    " And when her efforts were honored in 2011 and she was given National Youth Peace Prize and she became a very famous, very popular young girl of her country.": 1,
    " Before that, she was my daughter, but now I am her father.": 1,
    " Ladies and gentlemen, if we glance to human history, the story of a woman is the story of injustice, inequality, violence.": 1,
    " and exploitation.": 1,
    " You see.": 1,
    " and patriarchal societies.": 1,
    " Right from the very beginning when a girl is born,": 1,
    " her birth is not celebrated.": 1,
    " She is not welcomed neither by father nor by mother.": 1,
    " neighborhood comes and commiserate with mother and nobody congratulates the father.": 1,
    " And a mother is very uncomfortable for having a girl child.": 1,
    " When she gives birth to the first girl child, first daughter, she is sad.": 1,
    " When she gives birth to the second daughter, she is shocked.": 1,
    " And in the expectation of a son, when she gives birth to a third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.": 1,
    " Not only the mother suffers, but the daughter, the newly born daughter, when she grows old, she suffers too.": 1,
    " At the age of five, while she should be going to school, she stays at home and her brothers are admitted in a school.": 1,
    " Until the age of 12, somehow she has a good life.": 1,
    "She can have fun, she can play with her friends in the streets, and she can move around in the streets like a butterfly.": 1,
    " But when she enters her teens, when she becomes 13 years old, she is forbidden to go out of her home without a male escort.": 1,
    " She is confined under the four walls of her home.": 1,
    " She is no more.": 1,
    "She is no more a free individual.": 1,
    "She becomes the so-called honor of her father and of her brothers and of her family.": 1,
    " And if she transgresses the code of that so-called honor, even she could be killed.": 1,
    " And it's also interesting that this so-called code of honor, it does not only affect the life of a girl, it also affects the life of the male members of the family.": 1,
    " I know a family of...": 1,
    " seven sisters and one brother.": 1,
    " and date one brother.": 1,
    " He has migrated to the Gulf countries to unleaving for his seven sisters and parents.": 1,
    " because he thinks that he thinks that it will be humiliating if his seven sisters learn a skill and they go out of home and earn some livelihood.": 1,
    " So this brother, he sacrifices the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters": 1,
    " at the altar of so-called honor.": 1,
    " And there is one more norm of the patriarchal societies that is called obedience.": 1,
    " A good girl is supposed to be very quiet, very humble.": 1,
    " and very submissive.": 1,
    " It is the criteria and the role model good girl should be very quiet.": 1,
    "She is supposed to be silent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of elders.": 1,
    " if even she does not like.": 1,
    "If she's married to a man she doesn't like, or if she is married to an old man, she has to accept because she does not want to be dubbed as disobedient.": 1,
    " If she is married very early she has to accept otherwise she would be called disobedient.": 1,
    " And what happens at the end?": 1,
    " In the words of a poetess, she is wedded, bedded, and then she gives birth to more sons and daughters.": 1,
    " And it is the irony of situation that this mother, she teaches the same lesson of obedience to her daughter and the same lesson of honor to her sons.": 1,
    " And this vicious cycle goes on, goes on.": 1,
    " Ladies and gentlemen.": 1,
    " this plight of millions of women could be changed.": 1,
    " if we think differently, if women and men think differently.": 1,
    " if men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies in the developing countries, if they can break few norms of family and society.": 1,
    " if they can abolish the discriminatory laws": 1,
    " of the systems in their states which go against the basic human rights of the women.": 1,
    " Dear brothers and sisters, when Malala was born,": 1,
    " And for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborn children, to be honest.": 1,
    " But when I went and I looked into her eyes, believe me,": 1,
    " I got extremely honored.": 1,
    " And long before she was born, I thought about her name.": 1,
    " And I was fascinated with a heroic, legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan.": 1,
    "Her name was Malali of Mewand.": 1,
    " and I named my daughter after her.": 1,
    " Few days after Malala was born, my daughter was born, my cousin came to, and it was a coincidence, he came to my home.": 1,
    " and he brought a family tree, family tree of Yusufzai family.": 1,
    " And when I looked at the family tree, it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors.": 1,
    " But when I looked, all were men.": 1,
    " And I picked my pin, drew a line from my name, and wrote Malala.": 1,
    " and when she grow old.": 1,
    " When she was four and a half years old, I admitted her in my school.": 1,
    " You will be asking that why should I mention about the admission of a girl in a school?": 1,
    "Yes, I must mention it.": 1,
    " It may be taken for granted in Canada, in America, in many developed countries.": 1,
    " But in poor countries, in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies, it's a big event for the life of a girl.": 1,
    "Enrollment in a school means": 1,
    " recognition of her identity and her name.": 1,
    " Admission in a school means that she has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where she can explore her potentials for her future life.": 1,
    " I have five sisters and none of them could go to school.": 1,
    " And you will astonish when I was feeling": 1,
    " Two weeks before when I was filling the Canadian visa form,": 1,
    " and I was filling the family part of the form.": 1,
    " I could not recall the surnames of some of my sisters.": 1,
    " And the reason was that I have never, never seen the names of my sisters written on any document.": 1,
    " That was the reason that": 1,
    " I valued my daughter.": 1,
    "What my father could not": 1,
    " gave to my sisters and to his daughters, I thought I must change it.": 1,
    " I used to appreciate the intelligence and the brilliance of my daughter.": 1,
    "I encouraged her to sit with me when my friends used to come.": 1,
    "I encouraged her to go with me to different meetings.": 1,
    " And all these good values I try to inculcate in her personality.": 1,
    "And this was not only she, only Malala.": 1,
    "I imparted all these good values to my school girl students and boy students as well.": 1,
    " I used education for emancipation.": 1,
    "I taught my girls, I taught my girl student to unlearn the lesson of obedience.": 1,
    " I taught my boy student to unlearn the lesson of so-called Sordo honor.": 1,
    " We were striving for more rights for women.": 1,
    " And we were struggling to have more and more space for the women in society.": 1,
    " But we came across a new phenomena.": 1,
    "It was lethal to human rights and particularly to women rights.": 1,
    "It was called Talibanization.": 1,
    " It means a complete negation of women participation in all political, economical, and social activities.": 1,
    " Hundreds of schools were blast.": 1,
    "Girls were prohibited from going to school.": 1,
    " Women were forced to wear veils and they were stopped to be going to the markets.": 1,
    " Musicians were silenced, girls were flogged, and singers were killed.": 1,
    " Millions were suffering, but few spoke.": 1,
    "And it was the most scary thing when you have all around": 1,
    " such people.": 1,
    " who kill and who flog and you speak for your rights.": 1,
    "It's really the most scary thing.": 1,
    " At the age of 10, Malala stood and she stood for the right of education.": 1,
    " She wrote a diary for the BBC blog.": 1,
    "She volunteered herself for the New York Times documentaries.": 1,
    " And she spoke from every platform she could.": 1,
    " and her voice was the most powerful voice.": 1,
    " It's spread like a crescendo all around the world.": 1,
    " And that was the reason that Taliban could not tolerate.": 1,
    " her campaign.": 1,
    "And on 9 October 2012, she was shot on the head at point blank range.": 1,
    "It was a doomsday for my family and for me.": 1,
    " the world turned into a big black hole.": 1,
    " while my daughter was on the verge of life and death.": 1,
    " I whispered into the ears of my wife.": 1,
    " Should I be blamed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter?": 1,
    " And she abruptly told me...": 1,
    " Please don't blame yourself.": 1,
    "You stood.": 1,
    " for the right cause.": 1,
    "You put your life at stake for the cause of truth, for the cause of peace, and for the cause of education.": 1,
    "And your daughter is inspired from you and she joined you.": 1,
    " You both were on the right path and God will protect her.": 1,
    " These few words meant a lot to me.": 1,
    "And I didn't ask this question again.": 1,
    " when Malala was in the hospital.": 1,
    " and she was going through the severe pains and she had severe headaches because her fashion nerve was cut down.": 1,
    " I used to see a dark shadow spreading on the face of my wife.": 1,
    " But my daughter never complained.": 1,
    " She used to tell us, I'm fine with my crooked smile and with my numbness in face.": 1,
    "I'll be okay, please don't worry.": 1,
    "She was a solace for us and she consoled us.": 1,
    " We learned from her how to be resilient in the most difficult times.": 1,
    " and I'm glad to share with you that": 1,
    " Despite being an icon": 1,
    " for the rights of children and women.": 1,
    "She is like any 16 years old girls.": 1,
    " She cries when her homework is incomplete.": 1,
    " She quarrels with her brothers and I am very happy for that.": 1,
    " People ask me.": 1,
    " What special is in my mentorship, which has made Malala so bold and so courageous and so vocal and poised?": 1,
    " I tell them, don't ask me what I did.": 1,
    "Ask me what I did not do.": 1,
    " I did not clip her wings.": 1,
    "And that's all.": 1,
