    " How can we use computers, cameras, microphones?": 1,
    " to represent the world in an alternative way, as much as possible?": 1,
    "How, maybe, is it possible to use the internet to create a new form of cinema?": 1,

    " all those films and represent music in a different way.": 1,
    " we wanted to create another type of intimacy using all those new technologies.": 1,
    "At the time,": 1,
    " ten years ago, actually.": 1,
    "There was no such project on the internet.": 1,
    "And I guess that's why the project we were making, the take-away shows, got quite successful, reaching millions of viewers.": 1,
    " After a while, I got a bit... I wanted to go somewhere else.": 1,
    "I felt the need to travel and to discover some other music to explore the world.": 1,
    " going to other corners.": 1,

    " My desire was to make it as a truck.": 1,
    "To do all those things, it would have been impossible with a big company behind me, with a structure or anything.": 1,
    "I was traveling alone with a backpack.": 1,
    " computer, camera, microphones in it.": 1,

    " After traveling all around the country, I had recorded 33 films.": 1,
    "Only with the help of local people.": 1,

    " to the moment and to decide, oh, this is important to make now.": 1,
    "This is important to record that whole person.": 1,
    "This is important to create this exchange.": 1,

    " I just want to represent them under a beautiful light.": 1,
    "I just want to portray them in a way that their grandchildren are going to look at their grandfather and they're going to be like, wow, my grandfather is as cool as Beyonce.": 1,
    " It's a really important thing.": 1,
    " It's really important because that's the way people are going to look differently at their own culture, at their own land.": 1,
    "They're going to think about it differently.": 1,
    "Maybe a way to maintain certain diversity.": 1,
    "There's a really good quote by American thinker Hacking Bay which says, every recording is a tombstone of a live performance.": 1,
    " It's a really good sentence to keep in mind nowadays, no?": 1,
    "In an era saturated by images.": 1,
    "What's the point of that?": 1,
    "Where do we go with it?": 1,
    " I was researching, I was still keeping this idea in mind.": 1,
    "What's the point?": 1,
    " I was researching on music, trying to pull, trying to get closer to a certain origin of it.": 1,
    "Where is this whole coming from?": 1,
    "I'm French.": 1,

    "Trying to regain a certain complexity.": 1,
    "It was still there.": 1,
    " I really believe cinema teaches us to see.": 1,
    " The way we show the world is going to change the way we see this world.": 1,
    " And we live in a moment where the mass media are doing a terrible, terrible job at representing the world.": 1,
    "Violence, extremists.": 1,

    "We have to prepare for the following performance and I have a question for you and the question is this.": 1,

    " How do you break the barrier when you show up with a lens?": 1,
    "How do you break the barrier with people when you show up with a camera?": 1,
    "How do you break it with your body?": 1,
    " more than with your knowledge.": 1,
    "That's what it teaches me, to travel, to trust the memory of the body more than the memory of the brain.": 1,
    "The respect is stepping forward, not stepping backward, and I really think that": 1,
    " By engaging your body in the moment, in a ceremony, in the places, people will call you and understand your energy.": 1,
    " You told me that most of the videos you have made are actually one single shot.": 1,
    "You don't do much editing.": 1,
    "You edited the ones for us at the beginning of the sessions because of the length and etc.": 1,
    "Otherwise you just go in and": 1,
    " capture whatever happens in front of your eyes without much planning and so is that the case?": 1,
    "Is that correct?": 1,
    "My idea is that I think that as long as we don't cut, as long as we let the viewer watch": 1,
    " more and more the viewer is going to feel closer.": 1,
    "It's going to get closer to the moment, closer to that momentum, to that place.": 1,
    "I really think also that's a matter of respecting the viewer to not cut.": 1,
    " all the time from one place to another.": 1,
    "Just let the time go.": 1,
    " Tell me, in a few words, your new project, Hibridos, here in Brazil.": 1,
    "Just before coming to Tech Global, you've actually been traveling around the country for that.": 1,

    "The greatest country in terms of spirituality and experimentations in spiritualities.": 1,

    " which is researching in very different regions of Brazil, in very different forms of culture, and trying to understand how people live together with spirituality nowadays.": 1,
    " This man who's going to appear on stage momentarily and Vincent is going to introduce him, he's one of the subject of one of his past videos.": 1,
    "When did you do the video with him?": 1,
    "I guess four years ago.": 1,
    " Four years ago in my first year.": 1,
    "So it was one of your first ones in Brazil It was amongst the first ones in Brazil.": 1,
