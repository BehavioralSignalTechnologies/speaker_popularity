    " Let me show you some images of what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow.": 1,
    "So, that's Kibera, the largest squatter community in Nairobi.": 1,
    " This is the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Bombay, India, what's called Mumbai these days.": 1,
    "This is Rocinha, the largest and most urbanized favela in Rio de Janeiro.": 1,
    " And this is Sultanbeyli, which is one of the largest squather communities in Istanbul.": 1,
    " They are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow, the new urban world.": 1,
    "Now, why do I say that?": 1,
    "To tell you about that, I have to talk about this fellow here.": 1,
    "His name is Julius.": 1,
    "And I met Julius": 1,
    " the last week that I was living in Kibera.": 1,
    "So I had been there almost three months and I was touring around the city going to different squatter areas and Julius was tagging along and he was bug-eyed": 1,
    " And at certain points, we were walking around, he grabbed my hand for support, which is something most Kenyans would never consider doing.": 1,
    "They're very polite and they don't...": 1,
    " They don't get so forward so quickly.": 1,
    "And I found out later that it was Julius's first day in Nairobi.": 1,
    " And he's one of many.": 1,
    "So close to 200,000 people a day migrate from the rural to the urban areas.": 1,
    " That's, and I'm gonna be fair to the statisticians who talked this morning, not almost 1.5 million people a week, but almost 1.4 million people a week, but I'm a journalist and we exaggerate, so almost 1.5 million people a week, close to 70 million people.": 1,
    " a year.": 1,
    "And if you do the math, that's 130 people every minute.": 1,
    "So that'll be in the 18 minutes that I'm given to talk here, between 2,000 and 3,000 people will have journeyed to the cities.": 1,
    " And here are the statistics.": 1,
    "Today, a billion squatters, one in six people on the planet.": 1,
    " 2030, two billion squatters, one in four people on the planet.": 1,
    "And the estimate is that in 2050 there will be three billion squatters, better than one in three people on Earth.": 1,
    " These are the cities of the future and": 1,
    " We have to engage them.": 1,
    "And I was thinking this morning of...": 1,
    " the good life.": 1,
    "And before I show you the rest of my presentation, I'm going to violate Ted rules here and I'm going to read you something from my book.": 1,
    " as quickly as I can.": 1,
    "Because I think it says something about reversing our perception of what we think the good life is.": 1,
    " So.": 1,
    " The hut was made of corrugated metal, set on a concrete pad.": 1,
    "It was a 10 by 10 cell.": 1,
    "Armstrong O'Brien Jr.": 1,
    "shared it with three other men.": 1,
    " Armstrong and his friends had no water.": 1,
    "They bought it from a nearby tap owner.": 1,
    "No toilet.": 1,
    "The families in this compound shared a single pit latrine and no sewers or sanitation.": 1,
    " They did have electricity, but it was a legal service tapped from someone else's wires and could only power one feeble bulb.": 1,
    " This was Southland, a small shanty community on the western side of Nairobi, Kenya.": 1,
    "But it could have been anywhere in the city.": 1,
    " because more than half the city of Nairobi lives like this.": 1,
    "1.5 million people stuffed into mud or metal huts with no services, no toilets, no rights.": 1,
    " Armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation.": 1,
    "They paid 1500 shillings in rent, about 20 bucks a month, a relatively high price for a Kenyan shanty town, and they could not afford to be late with the money.": 1,
    " In case you owe one month, the landlord will come with his henchmen and bundle you out.": 1,
    "He will confiscate your things, Armstrong said.": 1,
    "Not one month, one day.": 1,
    " His roommate, Hilary Kibagendi-Ansomu, who was cooking ugali, the spongy white cornmeal concoction that is the staple food in the country, cut into the conversation.": 1,
    "They called their landlord a wabenzi.": 1,
    " meaning that he's a person who has enough money to drive a Mercedes Benz.": 1,
    " Hillary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes.": 1,
    "The sun slammed down on the thin steel roof, and we perspired as we ate.": 1,
    "After we finished, Armstrong straightened his tie, put on a wool sports jacket, and we headed out into the glare.": 1,
    " Outside, a mound of garbage formed the border between Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata.": 1,
    "It was perhaps 8 feet tall, 40 feet long, and 10 feet wide.": 1,
    " and it was set in a wider watery ooze.": 1,
    "As we passed, two boys were climbing the Mount Kenya of trash.": 1,
    " They couldn't have been more than five or six years old.": 1,
    "They were barefoot, and with each step their toes sank into the muck, sending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile.": 1,
    "I thought they might be playing King of the Hill.": 1,
    " But I was wrong.": 1,
    "Once atop the pile, one of the boys lowered his shorts, squatted, and defecated.": 1,
    "The flies buzzed hungrily around his legs.": 1,
    " When 20 families, 100 people or so, share a single latrine, a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing.": 1,
    " But it stood in jarring contrast to something Armstrong had said as we were eating, that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood.": 1,
    "For Armstrong, Southland wasn't constrained by its material conditions.": 1,
    " Instead, the human spirit radiated out from the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something no legal neighborhood could.": 1,
    "Freedom.": 1,
    " This place is very addictive, he had said.": 1,
    "It's a simple life but nobody is restricting you.": 1,
    "Nobody is controlling what you do.": 1,
    " Once you have stayed here, you cannot go back.": 1,
    "He meant back beyond that mountain of trash, back in the legal city of legal buildings with legal leases and legal rights.": 1,
    " Once you have stayed here, he said, you can stay for the rest of your life.": 1,
    " So he has hope.": 1,
    " And this is where these communities start.": 1,
    "This is perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find in Kibera.": 1,
    "A little more than a stick of mud hut next to a garbage heap.": 1,
    " This is getting ready for the monsoon in Bombay, India.": 1,
    "This is home improvement, putting plastic tarps on your roof.": 1,
    "This is in Rio de Janeiro, and it's getting a bit better, right?": 1,
    " We're seeing scavenged terracotta tile and little pieces of signs and plaster over the brick, some color.": 1,
    "And this is Suleymanakaya's house in Sultanbeyli, and it's getting even better.": 1,
    " He's got a fence, he's scavenged the door, he's got new tile on the roof, and then you get Rocinha, and you can see that it's...": 1,
    " getting even better.": 1,
    "The buildings here are multi-story.": 1,
    "They develop, you can see on the far right one where it seems to just stack on top of each other room after room after room.": 1,
    " And what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories and they sell their lager or roof rights.": 1,
    " and someone else builds on top of their building, and then that person sells the roof rights and someone else builds on top of their building.": 1,
    "All of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick.": 1,
    " And then you get Sultan Bailey in Turkey, where it's even built to a higher level of design.": 1,
    "The crud in the front is mattress stuffing, and you see that all over Turkey.": 1,
    "People dry out or air out their mattress stuffing.": 1,
    " on the roofs.": 1,
    "But the green building on behind, you can see that the top floor is not occupied.": 1,
    "So people are building with the possibility of expansion.": 1,
    "And it's built to a pretty high standard of design.": 1,
    " And then you finally get squatter homes like this, which is built on the suburban model.": 1,
    "Hey, that's a single family home in the squatter community.": 1,
    "That's also in Istanbul, Turkey.": 1,
    " They're quite vital places, these communities.": 1,
    "This is the main drag of Rocinha, the Estrada da Gavia, and there's a bus route.": 1,
    " that runs through it, lots of people out on the street.": 1,
    "These communities in these cities are actually more vital than the illegal communities.": 1,
    "They have more things going on in them.": 1,
    " This is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a beijo.": 1,
    "These are how you get around the community.": 1,
    "It's on very steep ground.": 1,
    "They're built on the hills inland from the beaches in Rio.": 1,
    " And you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions.": 1,
    "So that's just a rock in the hillside.": 1,
    "And these bacos are normally very crowded and people hump furniture up them, refrigerators up them, all sorts of things.": 1,
    " Beer is all carried in on your shoulders.": 1,
    "Beer is a very important thing in Brazil.": 1,
    " This is commerce in Kenya, right along the train tracks, so close to the train tracks that the merchants sometimes have to pull their merchandise out of the way.": 1,
    " This is a marketplace also in Kenya, Toy Market.": 1,
    "Lots of dealers and almost everything you want to buy.": 1,
    "Those green things in the foreground are mangoes.": 1,
    " This is a shopping street in Kibera, and you can see that there's a soda dealer, a health clinic, two beauty salons, a bar, two grocery stores, and a church, and more.": 1,
    "It's a typical downtown street.": 1,
    " It just happens to be self-built.": 1,
    "This here on the right hand side is what's called, if you look at the fine print under the awning, it's a hotel.": 1,
    " And what hotel means in Kenya and India is an eating place.": 1,
    "So that's a restaurant.": 1,
    "People steal electrical power.": 1,
    "This is Rio.": 1,
    " People tap in and they have thieves who are called grios.": 1,
    " or crickets and they steal the electrical power and wire the neighborhood.": 1,
    "People burn trash to get rid of the garbage and they dig their own sewer channels.": 1,
    "Talk about more plastic bags than plankton.": 1,
    " and sometimes they have natural trash disposal.": 1,
    " And when they have more money they cement their streets and they put in sewers and good water pipes and stuff like that.": 1,
    "This is water going to Rio people.": 1,
    " run their water pipes all over the place, and that little hut right there has a pump in it, and that's what people do.": 1,
    "They steal electricity, they install a pump, and they tap into the water main and pump water up to their houses.": 1,
    " So, the question is, how do you go from the mud hut village to the more developed city to the even highly developed Sultane Valley?": 1,
    "I say there are two things.": 1,
    "One is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted.": 1,
    " That does not necessarily mean property rights, and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question, because property rights create a lot of complications, they're most often sold to people.": 1,
    " and people then wind up in debt and have to pay back the debt and sometimes have to sell their property in order to pay back the debt.": 1,
    "There's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights sometimes don't work in these cases, but they do need security of tenure.": 1,
    " and they need access to politics.": 1,
    " And that can mean two things.": 1,
    "That can mean community organizing from below, but it can also mean possibilities from above.": 1,
    "And I say that because the system in Turkey is": 1,
    " Notable, Turkey has two great laws that protect squatters.": 1,
    "One is that it's called gece kandu in Turkish, which means built overnight.": 1,
    "And if you build your house overnight in Turkey, you can't be evicted without due process of law.": 1,
    " if they don't catch you during the night.": 1,
    "And the second aspect is that": 1,
    " Once you have 2,000 people in the community, you can petition the government to be recognized as a legal submunicipality.": 1,
    " And when you're a legal sub-municipality, you suddenly have politics.": 1,
    "You're allowed to have an elected government, collect taxes, provide municipal services, and that's exactly what they do.": 1,
    "So, these are the civic leaders of the future.": 1,
    " The woman in the center is Geetha Jiwa.": 1,
    "She lives in one of those tents on the highway median in Mumbai.": 1,
    " That's Sharika Gundi.": 1,
    "She also lives with her family on the 10th along the same highway median.": 1,
    "They're very outspoken.": 1,
    "They're very active.": 1,
    "They can be community leaders.": 1,
    " This woman is Nene, which means grandma in Turkish.": 1,
    "And there were three old ladies who lived in, that's her self-built house behind her.": 1,
    "And they've lived there for 30 or 40 years and they are the backbone of the community there.": 1,
    " This is Richard Muthama-Peter, and he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera.": 1,
    "He makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood and the people in the neighborhood, and is a great resource in the community.": 1,
    "And finally, my choice to run for mayor of Rio.": 1,
    " is Zezinho, the fruit merchant with his two kids here and a more honest and giving and caring man.": 1,
    "I don't know.": 1,
    "The future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people.": 1,
    " So I think the message I take from what I read from the book, from what Armstrong said, and from all these people is that these are neighborhoods.": 1,
    " The issue is not urban poverty.": 1,
    "The issue is not the larger overarching thing.": 1,
    "The issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods.": 1,
    "This is a legitimate form of urban development and that cities have to engage.": 1,
    " these residents because they are building the cities of the future.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
