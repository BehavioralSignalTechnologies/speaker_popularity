    " I'm a filmmaker.": 1,
    "For the last eight years, I have dedicated my life to documenting the work of Israelis and Palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means.": 1,
    " When I travel with my work across Europe and the United States, one question always comes up.": 1,
    " Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?": 1,
    "Why aren't Palestinians using nonviolent resistance?": 1,
    " The challenge I face when I hear this question is that often I have just returned from the Middle East, where I spent my time filming.": 1,
    " dozens of Palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from Israeli soldiers and settlers.": 1,
    " These leaders are trying to forge a massive national non-violent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region.": 1,
    "Yet most of you have probably never heard about them.": 1,
    " This divide between what's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we don't have yet a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful.": 1,
    " So I'm here today to talk about the power of attention, the power of your attention in the emergence and development of non-violent movements in the West Bank, Gaza, and elsewhere.": 1,
    " But today, my case study is going to be Palestine.": 1,
    " I believe that what's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for Palestinians to start adopting nonviolence, but for us to start paying attention to those who already are.": 1,
    " Allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called Budrus.": 1,
    "About seven years ago,": 1,
    " they faced extinction because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village.": 1,
    " they would lose 40% of their land and be surrounded, so they would lose free access to the rest of the West Bank.": 1,
    " Through inspired local leadership, they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening.": 1,
    "Let me show you some brief clips so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground.": 1,
    " The walls are separated between Palestine and Israel.": 1,
    "Here in Jerusalem, we discovered that the walls were made of soil.": 1,
    " Defense has, in fact, created a solution to terror.": 1,
    " Alley-O!": 1,
    " You are called to a peaceful march for the Syrian people to cooperate with you.": 1,
    " Your brothers and sisters, we are coming to you from Israel.": 1,
    "We are on our way to the airport.": 1,
    " We saw the men trying to push the soldiers and none of them could do that.": 1,
    "But I think the girls could do it.": 1,
    " If you want to succeed, you have to use your traditional brain.": 1,
    " We were in a complete agreement.": 1,
    "We wanted this to be distributed to the whole of Palestine.": 1,
    " Amidst me, a case against my brothers.": 1,
    "The police were shocked when they found out about the terrorist attack and found out all the information about it.": 1,
    "Yes, that's the right way.": 1,
    " I was sure that we were all going to die.": 1,
    "And here are the people around me, who don't even die.": 1,
    " A non-violent focus is not going to stop you all the time, believe me once.": 1,
    " This is a peaceful mass, there is no need to use violence.": 1,
    " Yeah!": 1,
    " you": 1,
    " When I first heard about the story of Boudreaux, I was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago in 2003.": 1,
    " What was even more surprising was the fact that Budrus was successful.": 1,
    "The residents, after 10 months of peaceful resistance, convinced the Israeli government to move the root of the barrier off their lands": 1,
    " and to the green line, which is the internationally recognized boundary between Israel and the Palestinian territories.": 1,
    " The resistance in Budrus has since spread to villages across the West Bank and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.": 1,
    "Yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories.": 1,
    " This silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow or even survive in Palestine.": 1,
    " violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common.": 1,
    "They are both a form of theater, seeking an audience to their cause.": 1,
    " if violent actors are the only ones constantly getting front page cover and attracting international attention to the Palestinian issue.": 1,
    " it becomes very hard for non-violent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option in addressing their plight.": 1,
    " The power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room.": 1,
    "The surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit.": 1,
    " The tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior, since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it.": 1,
    " Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children.": 1,
    " But that's true for adults, too.": 1,
    "In fact, the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention.": 1,
    " I believed that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior.": 1,
    " by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today.": 1,
    " In the course of taking my film to villages in the West Bank, in Gaza, and in East Jerusalem, I have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation.": 1,
    " In a village called Wallachie, which sits very close to Jerusalem, the community was facing a very similar plight to Boudreau's.": 1,
    " They were going to be surrounded, lose a lot of their lands, and not have freedom of access, either to the West Bank or Jerusalem.": 1,
    " They had been using nonviolence for about two years, but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention.": 1,
    "So we organized a screening.": 1,
    " A week later, they held the most well attended and disciplined demonstration to date.": 1,
    " The organizers say that the villagers, upon seeing the story of Buddhas documented in a film, felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing, that people cared, so they kept on going.": 1,
    " On the Israeli side, there is a new peace movement called Solidariot, which means solidarity in Hebrew.": 1,
    " The leaders of this movement have been using Boudreaux as one of their primary recruiting tools.": 1,
    "They report that Israelis who had never been active before upon seeing the film": 1,
    " understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities.": 1,
    " The examples of Wallag\u00e9 and the Solidarity Movement show that even a small-budget, independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior.": 1,
    " Now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly non-violent demonstrations happening in villages like Bilain, Nialin, Wallag\u00e9.": 1,
    " in Jerusalem neighborhoods like Shear Jarrah and Silouan.": 1,
    " the non-violent leaders would become more visible, valued, and effective in their work.": 1,
    " I believe that": 1,
    " The most important thing is to understand that if we don't pay attention to these efforts, they are invisible.": 1,
    "And it's as if they never happened.": 1,
    "But I have seen firsthand that": 1,
    " If we do, they will multiply.": 1,
    " If they multiply, their influence will grow in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.": 1,
    "And theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation.": 1,
    " These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus.": 1,
    "Let's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
