    " Humans in the developed world spend more than 90% of their lives indoors where they breathe in and come into contact with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye, microorganisms.": 1,
    " Buildings are complex ecosystems that are an important source of microbes that are good for us and some that are bad for us.": 1,
    "What determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors?": 1,
    " Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes that enter through windows and through mechanical ventilation systems, and they are brought inside by humans and other creatures.": 1,
    " The fate of microbes indoors depends on complex interactions with humans and with the human built environment.": 1,
    "And today, architects and biologists are working together to": 1,
    " explore smart building design that will create healthy buildings for us.": 1,
    " We spend an extraordinary amount of time in buildings that are extremely controlled environments like this building here.": 1,
    " environments that have mechanical ventilation systems that include filtering, heating, and air conditioning.": 1,
    "Given the amount of time that we spend indoors, it's important to understand how this affects our health.": 1,
    " At the biology and built environment center, we carried out a study in a hospital where we sampled air and pulled the DNA out of microbes in the air, and we looked at three different types of": 1,
    " We looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated, which are the data points in the blue.": 1,
    "We looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated, where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building.": 1,
    " and pry open the windows that were no longer operable, but they made them operable for our study, and we also sampled the outdoor air.": 1,
    " If you look at the x-axis of this graph, you'll see that what we commonly want to do, which is keeping the outdoors out, we accomplish that with mechanical ventilation.": 1,
    " So if you look at the green data points, which is air that's outside, you'll see that there's a large amount of microbial diversity or variety of microbial types.": 1,
    "But if you look at the blue data points, which is mechanically ventilated air, it's not as diverse.": 1,
    " But being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health.": 1,
    "If you look at the y-axis of this graph, you'll see that in the mechanically ventilated air,": 1,
    " You have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen or germ than if you're outdoors.": 1,
    " So to understand why this was the case, we took our data and put it into an ordination diagram, which is a statistical map": 1,
    " that tells you something about how related the microbial communities are in the different samples.": 1,
    "The data points that are closer together have microbial communities that are more similar than data points that are far apart.": 1,
    " And the first thing that you can see from this graph is if you look at the blue data points, which are the mechanically ventilated air, they're not simply a subset of the green data points, which are the outdoor air.": 1,
    " What we found is that mechanically ventilated air looks like humans.": 1,
    "It has microbes on it that are commonly associated with our skin and with our mouth, our spit.": 1,
    " And this is because we are all constantly shedding microbes.": 1,
    "So all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one another.": 1,
    " And when you're outdoors that type of air has microbes that are commonly associated with plant leaves and with dirt.": 1,
    " Why does this matter?": 1,
    "It matters because the healthcare industry is the second most energy intensive industry in the United States.": 1,
    "Hospitals use two and a half times the amount of energy as office buildings.": 1,
    " And the model that we're working with in hospitals and also with many, many different buildings is to keep the outdoors out.": 1,
    "And this model may not necessarily be the best for our health.": 1,
    " And given the extraordinary amount of nosocomial infections or hospital-acquired infections, this is a clue that it's a good time to reconsider our current practices.": 1,
    " So just as we manage national parks where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others, we are working towards": 1,
    " thinking about buildings using an ecosystem framework where we can promote the kinds of microbes that we want to have indoors.": 1,
    " I've heard somebody say that you're as healthy as your gut.": 1,
    " And for this reason, many people eat probiotic yogurt so they can promote a healthy gut flora.": 1,
    "And what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote": 1,
    " a healthy group of microorganisms inside.": 1,
