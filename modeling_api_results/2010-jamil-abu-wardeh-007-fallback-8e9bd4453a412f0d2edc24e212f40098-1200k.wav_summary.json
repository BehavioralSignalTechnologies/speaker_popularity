    " This talk is about writing, writing wrongs.": 1,
    "No, this sounds not faulty.": 1,
    "Writing, writing wrongs.": 1,
    "The Middle East is huge.": 1,
    " And with all our problems, one thing's for sure, we love to laugh.": 1,
    "I think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences.": 1,
    "We need to take our responsibilities seriously, but not ourselves.": 1,
    " Don't get me wrong, it's not like we don't have comedy in the Middle East.": 1,
    "I grew up at a time when iconic actors from Kuwait, Syria, Egypt used laughter to unite the region.": 1,
    " just as football can.": 1,
    " Now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves before others can laugh with us.": 1,
    "This is the story of the rise and rise of stand-up comedy in the Middle East.": 1,
    "A stand-up uprising, if you will.": 1,
    " Working in London as a TV maker and writer, I quickly realized that comedy connects audiences.": 1,
    " Now, the best breeding ground for good comedy writing is the stand-up comedy circuit, where they just happen to say that you kill when you do well and you bomb when you do badly.": 1,
    "An unfortunate connection for us maybe, but it reminds me that": 1,
    " We'd like to thank one man for over the past decade working tirelessly to support comedians all around the world specifically.": 1,
    " comedians with a Middle Eastern background.": 1,
    " Like my good friends Dean and Maysoon at the bottom of the screen who two years after 9-11 started a festival to change the way Middle Easterners are perceived in the world.": 1,
    "It's still going strong with positive PR to die for.": 1,
    " Also, three guys working for years in Los Angeles, an Iranian, a Palestinian, and an Egyptian, created the aptly named Axis of Evil Comedy Act.": 1,
    " And wherever they went, they killed.": 1,
    " Now, I didn't start this fire, but I did pour petrol on it.": 1,
    "I moved to Dubai as the head of original content for a Western TV network.": 1,
    "My job was to connect the brand with the Middle Eastern audience.": 1,
    " Now, the American head of programming wanted new local Arabic comedy.": 1,
    " In a thick Arabic accent, my brain went, perfect.": 1,
    "Now, I had friends in the US who had started a successful new tribe.": 1,
    " and I had every intention of taking this tribe from being outliers in the Middle East and pushing them over the tipping point towards success.": 1,
    " Now, as with any new idea, it wasn't easy.": 1,
    "I had four phases to this plan.": 1,
    "First, we'd need to buy content from the West and air it.": 1,
    "Then I'd bring my friends and we'd show local amateurs how it's done.": 1,
    "We would film that and air it.": 1,
    " and then I could work with the local amateurs and write a new comedy.": 1,
    "I excitedly presented this to the big boss, and his reaction was, uh, I don't get it.": 1,
    " So I retreated back to my cave and continued to support and produce comedy and let my friends use my couch as a regional operations hub.": 1,
    "Now fast forward two years to early 2007.": 1,
    " the earth rotated as did our management.": 1,
    "And as if...": 1,
    " By divine intervention, things came together to help this revolution take shape.": 1,
    "Here's how the dots connected.": 1,
    "First, the Axis guys recorded a Comedy Central special that aired in the States, and it was getting great hits on YouTube.": 1,
    " our new French CEO believed in the power of positive PR and": 1,
    " ideas du bon march\u00e9.": 1,
    "Let's just say value for money.": 1,
    " I produced in Dubai a show for Ahmed Ahmed to showcase his new access special to a packed room.": 1,
    "I invited our new CEO, and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels, his reaction was very simple.": 1,
    "Let's mix this up on.": 1,
    " And one more singer, don't eff it up.": 1,
    "So I quickly went to work with a great team around me.": 1,
    "I happened to find a funny guy to present it in Arabic, who is originally Korean.": 1,
    " A perfect fit for the axis of evil.": 1,
    "This is all true.": 1,
    "Now, while preparing for the tour, I had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive.": 1,
    "I used the three B's of stand-up don'ts, as I call them in the Middle East.": 1,
    " Blue content, keep it clean.": 1,
    "Beliefs, no religion.": 1,
    "And the third B.": 1,
    " Bulletics.": 1,
    "Stay away from politics in the Middle East.": 1,
    "Of course, you might think what's left without politics, sex and religion, how it can make people laugh.": 1,
    "I'd say watch any successful, well-written, family-friendly sitcom in the West for your answers.": 1,
    " Now,": 1,
    " Were the access successful?": 1,
    "In five countries in just under a month, we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live.": 1,
    "We had millions see them on TV and on TV news.": 1,
    " In Jordan we had His Majesty the King come and see them.": 1,
    "In fact they were so successful that you could buy a pirated copy of their DVD even before it was released in the Middle East.": 1,
    "Anywhere you want.": 1,
    " So everywhere we went, we auditioned amateurs.": 1,
    "We filmed that process and aired a documentary.": 1,
    "I called it Three Guys and One Home.": 1,
    "It really is his name.": 1,
    " And all this TV and Internet exposure has led to a great many recruits to our cause.": 1,
    "In Dubai this year, we've just had the first all-women's homegrown stand-up show.": 1,
    "And notice two of them are wearing head scarves, and yes, even they can laugh.": 1,
    " Dubai to me is like a hand that supports anyone who wants to make things happen.": 1,
    " 20 years ago, no one had heard of it.": 1,
    "Look at it now.": 1,
    " With an inspirational leader, I think this year, the opening of the tallest tower in the world is like adding a finger to that hand that points at all those who spread fallacious stories about us.": 1,
    " Now, in three short years, we've come a long way, with stand-up comedy shows happening even in Saudi Arabia.": 1,
    "These comics are now going to the New York Festival, and the brilliant Lebanese, Nimar Abunassar, we featured in our first tour.": 1,
    " has just been performing in LA's legendary comedy club.": 1,
    "So clearly from the inside we are doing our best to change our image and it's exploding.": 1,
    " So.": 1,
    " As for the outsiders looking in, watch the CNN report on the second Amman Comedy Festival.": 1,
    "The reporter did a great job, and I thank her, but somebody forgot to send the positive PR email to the person operating the automatic news ticket that appears at the bottom.": 1,
    " For example, when Dean talks, the ticker says, US, suspect gave actionable intel.": 1,
    "Well, if you're used to listening to comedians, then I'm not surprised.": 1,
    " Sadly, this leads me to another three Bs.": 1,
    "That represents how the media in the West talks about us as bombers, billionaires, and belly dancers.": 1,
    " Enough.": 1,
    "We're not all angry fanatics who want to kill the infidel.": 1,
    "We have a positive story to tell and image to sell.": 1,
    "In fact, one thing's for sure in my experience, we love to laugh.": 1,
    " Like hell.": 1,
    " Here are three questions that I like to use to test the truthiness of our representation in any media story.": 1,
    "One, is the Middle East being shown in a current time and correct context?": 1,
    " Two, do the Middle Eastern characters laugh or smile without showing the whites of their eyes?": 1,
    " Three, is the Middle Eastern character being played by one?": 1,
    " Clearly, there are wrongs that need to be righted.": 1,
    "We started in our region.": 1,
    " My challenge to the rest of the world is, please, start using positive Middle Eastern images in your stories.": 1,
    "For inspiration, go to one of our festivals, go online, drop us a line.": 1,
    "Let's change the narrative together.": 1,
    " and let's start writing, writing wrongs.": 1,
    "I'd like to end, before going back to the Middle East, with a quote from one of the greatest sheiks to put quill to parchment, as my father likes to call him, a sheikh, a zubir, as my mother would say, Shakespeare.": 1,
    " And now we go in content to liberty and not to banishment.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
