    " Three and a half years ago, I made one of the best decisions of my life.": 1,
    "As my New Year's resolution, I gave up dieting, stopped worrying about my weight, and learned to eat mindfully.": 1,
    " Now I eat whenever I'm hungry, and I've lost 10 pounds.": 1,
    " This was me at age 13 when I started my first diet.": 1,
    "I look at that picture now and I think, you did not need a diet, you needed a fashion consult.": 1,
    " but I thought I needed to lose weight.": 1,
    " And when I gained it back, of course I blamed myself.": 1,
    " For the next three decades, I was on and off various diets.": 1,
    "No matter what I tried, the weight I'd lost always came back.": 1,
    "I'm sure many of you know the feeling.": 1,
    " As a neuroscientist, I wondered why is this so hard?": 1,
    "Obviously, how much you weigh depends on how much you eat and how much energy you burn.": 1,
    " What most people don't realize is that hunger and energy use are controlled by the brain, mostly without your awareness.": 1,
    " your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes.": 1,
    "And that is a good thing, because your conscious mind, how do we put this politely, it's easily distracted.": 1,
    " It's good that you don't have to remember to breathe when you get caught up in a movie.": 1,
    " You don't forget how to walk because you're thinking about what to have for dinner.": 1,
    "Your brain also has its own sense of what you should weigh, no matter what you consciously believe.": 1,
    " This is called your set point, but that's a misleading term because it's actually a range of about 10 or 15 pounds.": 1,
    " You can use lifestyle choices to move your weight up and down within that range, but it's much, much harder to stay outside of it.": 1,
    " the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates body weight.": 1,
    "There are more than a dozen chemical signals in the brain that tell your body to gain weight, more than another dozen that tell your body to lose it.": 1,
    " The system works like a thermostat, responding to signals from the body by adjusting hunger, activity and metabolism to keep your weight stable as conditions change.": 1,
    " That's what a thermostat does, right?": 1,
    "It keeps the temperature in your house the same as the weather changes outside.": 1,
    " Now, you can try to change the temperature in your house by opening a window in the winter, but that's not going to change the setting on the thermostat, which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up.": 1,
    " Your brain works exactly the same way, responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal.": 1,
    " If you lose a lot of weight, your brain reacts as if you were starving.": 1,
    " And whether you started out fat or thin, your brain's response is exactly the same.": 1,
    "We would love to think that your brain could tell whether you need to lose weight or not, but it can't.": 1,
    "If you do lose a lot of weight,": 1,
    " You become hungry.": 1,
    " and your muscles burn less energy.": 1,
    " Dr. Rudy Liebel of Columbia University has found that people who've lost 10% of their body weight burn 250 to 400 calories less because their metabolism is suppressed.": 1,
    "That's a lot of food.": 1,
    " This means that a successful dieter must eat this much less forever than someone of the same weight who's always been thin.": 1,
    " From an evolutionary perspective, your body's resistance to weight loss makes sense.": 1,
    "When food was scarce, our ancestors' survival depended on conserving energy.": 1,
    " and regaining the weight when food was available would have protected them against the next shortage.": 1,
    "Over the course of human history, starvation has been a much bigger problem than overeating.": 1,
    " This may explain a very sad fact.": 1,
    "Set points can go up.": 1,
    " but they rarely go down.": 1,
    " Now, if your mother ever mentioned that life is not fair, this is the kind of thing she was talking about.": 1,
    " Successful dieting doesn't lower your set point.": 1,
    "Even after you've kept the weight off for as long as seven years, your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back.": 1,
    " If that weight loss had been due to a long famine, that would be a sensible response.": 1,
    "In our modern world of drive-through burgers, it's not working out so well for many of us.": 1,
    " That difference between our ancestral past and our abundant present is the reason that Dr. Yoni Friedhoff of the University of Ottawa": 1,
    " would like to take some of his patients back to a time when food was less available.": 1,
    "And it's also the reason that changing the food environment is really going to be the most effective solution to obesity.": 1,
    " Sadly, a temporary weight gain can become permanent.": 1,
    "If you stay at a high weight for too long, probably a matter of years for most of us, your brain may decide that that's the new normal.": 1,
    " Psychologists classify eaters into two groups, those who rely on their hunger and those who try to control their eating through willpower, like most dieters.": 1,
    " now.": 1,
    " Let's call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters.": 1,
    " The interesting thing is that intuitive eaters are less likely to be overweight, and they spend less time thinking about food.": 1,
    " Controlled eaters are more vulnerable to overeating in response to advertising, supersizing, and the all you can eat buffet.": 1,
    " and a small indulgence like eating one scoop of ice cream.": 1,
    " is more likely to lead to a food binge in controlled eaters.": 1,
    " Children are especially vulnerable to this cycle of dieting and then binging.": 1,
    "Several long-term studies have shown that girls who diet in their early teenage years": 1,
    " are three times more likely to become overweight five years later, even if they started at a normal weight.": 1,
    "And all of these studies found that the same factors that predicted weight gain": 1,
    " also predicted the development of eating disorders.": 1,
    "The other factor, by the way, those of you who are parents, was being teased by family members about their weight.": 1,
    "So don't do that.": 1,
    " I left almost all my graphs at home, but I couldn't resist throwing in just this one, because I'm a geek and that's how I roll.": 1,
    " This is a study that looked at the risk of death over a 14-year period based on four healthy habits.": 1,
    "Eating enough fruits and vegetables, exercise three times a week, not smoking,": 1,
    " and drinking in moderation.": 1,
    "Let's start by looking at the normal weight people in the study.": 1,
    "The height of the bars is the risk of death and those 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 numbers on the horizontal axis are the number of those healthy habits that a given person had.": 1,
    " And as you'd expect, the healthier the lifestyle, the less likely people were to die during the study.": 1,
    "Now let's look at what happens in overweight people.": 1,
    " The ones that had no healthy habits had a higher risk of death.": 1,
    "Adding just one healthy habit pulls overweight people back into the normal range.": 1,
    " For obese people with no healthy habits, the risk is very high.": 1,
    "Seven times higher than the healthiest groups in the study.": 1,
    "But healthy lifestyle helps obese people too.": 1,
    " In fact, if you look only at the group with all four healthy habits, you can see that weight makes very little difference.": 1,
    "You can take control of your health by taking control of your lifestyle, even if you can't lose weight and keep it off.": 1,
    " Diets don't have very much reliability.": 1,
    "Five years after a diet, most people have regained the weight.": 1,
    "40% of them have gained even more.": 1,
    " You think about this, the typical outcome of dieting is that you're more likely to gain weight in the long run than to lose it.": 1,
    "If I've convinced you that dieting might be a problem,": 1,
    " The next question is, what do you do about it?": 1,
    "And my answer, in a word, is mindfulness.": 1,
    "I'm not saying you need to learn to meditate or take up yoga.": 1,
    "I'm talking about mindful eating.": 1,
    " learning to understand your body's signals so that you eat when you're hungry and stop when you're full.": 1,
    "Because a lot of weight gain boils down to eating when you're not hungry.": 1,
    " How do you do it?": 1,
    "Give yourself permission to eat as much as you want and then work on figuring out what makes your body feel good.": 1,
    "Sit down to regular meals.": 1,
    " without distractions, think about how your body feels when you start to eat and when you stop, and let your hunger decide when you should be done.": 1,
    " It took about a year for me to learn this, but it's really been worth it.": 1,
    "I am so much more relaxed around food than I have ever been in my life.": 1,
    " I often don't think about it.": 1,
    "I forget we have chocolate in the house.": 1,
    "I mean, it's like aliens have taken over my brain.": 1,
    "It's just completely different.": 1,
    " I should say that this approach to eating probably won't make you lose weight unless you often eat when you're not hungry.": 1,
    " But doctors don't know of any approach that makes significant weight loss in a lot of people.": 1,
    " And that is why a lot of people are now focusing on preventing weight gain instead of promoting weight loss.": 1,
    "Let's face it, if diets worked, we'd all be thin already.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " Why do we keep doing the same thing and expecting different results?": 1,
    " Diets may seem harmless, but they actually do a lot of collateral damage.": 1,
    "At worst, they ruin lives.": 1,
    "Weight obsession leads to eating disorders, especially in young kids.": 1,
    " In the US, we have 80% of 10-year-old girls say they've been on a diet.": 1,
    "Our daughters have learned to measure their worth by the wrong scale.": 1,
    " Even at its best, dieting is a waste of time and energy.": 1,
    "It takes willpower, which you could be using to help your kids with their homework or to finish that important work project.": 1,
    " And because willpower is limited, any strategy that relies on its consistent application is pretty much guaranteed.": 1,
    " to eventually fail you when your attention moves on to something else.": 1,
    " Let me leave you with one last thought.": 1,
    " What if we told all those dieting girls that it's OK to eat when they're hungry?": 1,
    "What if we taught them to work with their appetite instead of fearing it?": 1,
    "I think most of them would be happier and healthier, and as adults.": 1,
    " many of them would probably be thinner.": 1,
    " I wish someone had told me that back when I was 13.": 1,
    " Thanks.": 1,
    " So good.": 1
