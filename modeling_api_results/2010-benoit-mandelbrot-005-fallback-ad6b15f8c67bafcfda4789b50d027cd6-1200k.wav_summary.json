    " Thank you very much.": 2,
    "This comes out.": 2,
    "Please excuse me for sitting, I'm very old.": 1,
    "Well...": 1,
    " The topic I'm going to discuss is one which is in a certain sense very peculiar because it's very old.": 1,
    "Roughness is part of human life forever and forever and ancient authors have written about it.": 1,
    " It was very much uncontrollable and in a certain sense it seemed to be the extreme of complexity.": 1,
    "Just a mess, a mess, and a mess.": 1,
    "There are many different kinds of mess.": 1,
    " Now, in fact, by complete fluke, I got involved many years ago in the study of this form of complexity.": 1,
    " And to my utter amazement, I found traces, very strong traces, I must say, of odor in that roughness.": 1,
    " And so today I would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents.": 1,
    " I prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity, to somebody who had Latin in my long past use, means the country of regularity.": 1,
    " But it is not so.": 1,
    "Regularity is a country of roughness.": 1,
    "Because the basic aspect of the world is very rough.": 1,
    " So let me show you a few objects, some of them artificial, other of them very real in a certain sense.": 1,
    " Now, this is very real.": 1,
    "It's a cauliflower.": 1,
    "Now, why do I show a cauliflower, a very ordinary and ancient vegetable?": 1,
    "Because ordinary and ancient as it may be, it's very complicated.": 1,
    " And it's very simple, both at the same time.": 1,
    "If you try to weigh it, of course it's very easy to weigh it, and when you eat it, then the weight matters.": 1,
    "But suppose you try to measure its surface.": 1,
    " Well, it's very interesting.": 1,
    "If you cut with a sharp knife one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it separately, you think a whole cauliflower, but smaller.": 1,
    " And then you cut again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, and you still get more cauliflower.": 1,
    " So the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property that each part is like the whole, but smaller.": 1,
    " Now, what did you manage to do with that?": 1,
    "Very, very little.": 1,
    " What I did actually is to study this problem and found something quite surprising.": 1,
    "That one can measure roughness by number.": 1,
    " 2.3, 1.2, and sometimes much more.": 1,
    "One day a friend of mine, to bug me, brought a picture and said, what is the roughness of this curve?": 1,
    "I said, well, just short of 1.5.": 1,
    " was 1.48.": 1,
    "Now, it didn't take any time.": 1,
    "I've been looking at these things for so long, but these numbers are the numbers which denoted the roughness of these surfaces.": 1,
    " Hasten to say that these surfaces are completely artificial.": 1,
    "They were done on a computer, and the only input is a number, and that number is roughness.": 1,
    " And so on the left I took the roughness copied from many landscapes, to the right I took higher roughness.": 1,
    "So the eye, after a while, can distinguish these two very well.": 1,
    " humanity had to learn about measuring roughness.": 1,
    "This is very rough, and this is sort of smooth, and this is perfectly smooth.": 1,
    "Very few things are very smooth.": 1,
    "So if you try to ask questions, what surface of cauliflower": 1,
    " Well, you measure and measure and measure.": 1,
    "Each time you look closer, it gets bigger, down to very, very small distances.": 1,
    "What's the length or coastline of these lakes?": 1,
    "The closer you measure, the longer it is.": 1,
    " The concept of length of the coastline, which seems to be so natural because it's given in many places, is in fact complete fallacy.": 1,
    "There's no such thing.": 1,
    "You must do it differently.": 1,
    " What good is that to know these things?": 1,
    "Well, surprisingly enough, it's good in many ways.": 1,
    "To begin with, the official landscapes, which I invented sort of,": 1,
    " are used in cinema all the time.": 1,
    "You see mountains in distance, they may be mountains, but they may be just a formula, just cranked on.": 1,
    "Now it's very easy to do.": 1,
    " It used to be very time consuming, but now it's nothing.": 1,
    "Now look at that.": 1,
    "That's a real lung.": 1,
    "Now a lung is something very strange.": 1,
    "If you take this thing, you know very well it weighs very little.": 1,
    " The volume of a lung is very small.": 1,
    "But what about the area of the lung?": 1,
    " Anatomists were arguing very much about that.": 1,
    "Some say that normal males long has an area inside of a basketball, and the others say, no, five basketballs.": 1,
    " enormous disagreements.": 1,
    "Why so?": 1,
    "Because in fact, the area of the lung is something very ill-defined.": 1,
    "The bronchi, the bronchial branch,": 1,
    " And they branch not because, and they stop branching, not because of any matter of principle, but because of physical consideration, the mocus which is in the lung.": 1,
    " So what happens is that a whale will have a much bigger lung, but if it branches and branches down to distance, it's about the same for whale, for man, and for a little rodent.": 1,
    " So now, what good is it to have that?": 1,
    "Well, surprisingly enough, amazingly enough, the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently.": 1,
    "And I think that my mathematics": 1,
    " surprisingly enough, has been of great help to the surgeons studying lung illnesses and also kidney illnesses.": 1,
    "All these branching systems for which there was no geometry.": 1,
    " So I found myself, in other words, constructing a geometry.": 1,
    "A geometry of things which had no geometry.": 1,
    "And the surprising aspect of it is that very often the rules of this geometry are extremely short.": 1,
    " You have formulas that long, and you crank it several times, sometimes repeatedly, again, again, again, the same repetition.": 1,
    "And at the end, you get things like that.": 1,
    "This cloud is completely 100% artificial.": 1,
    " Well, 99.9.": 1,
    "And the only part which is natural is a number, the roughness of the cloud, which is taken from nature.": 1,
    " Something so complicated, cloud, so unstable, so varying, should have a simple rule behind it.": 1,
    "Now, the simple rule...": 1,
    " is not an explanation of clouds.": 1,
    "And the sea of clouds had to take account of it.": 1,
    "I don't know how much it advanced.": 1,
    "This picture is rather old.": 1,
    "I was very much involved in it.": 1,
    " then turn my attention to other phenomena.": 1,
    " Now, here is another thing which is rather interesting.": 1,
    "One of the shattering events in the history of mathematics, which is not appreciated by many people, occurred about 130 years ago, or 45 years ago.": 1,
    " The mathematicians began to create shapes that didn't exist.": 1,
    "The mathematicians got into self praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing that man can invent things that nature did not know.": 1,
    " In particular, it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane.": 1,
    "A curve is a curve, a plane is a plane, the two won't mix.": 1,
    "Well, they do mix.": 1,
    " A man named Peano did define such curves and it became an object of extraordinary interest.": 1,
    "It's very important, but mostly interest because it kind of breaks a separation between": 1,
    " the mathematics coming from reality on the one hand and new mathematics coming from pure man's mind.": 1,
    "Well, I was very sorry to point out that the pure man's mind has in fact": 1,
    " seen at long last what had been seen for a long time.": 1,
    "And so here I introduce something, the set of rivers of a plain-filling curve, and well, it's a story unto itself.": 1,
    " So it was in 1875, 1825, an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world.": 1,
    " and the objects which were used as examples when I was a child and a student as examples of the break between mathematics.": 1,
    " and visible reality, those objects, I turn them completely around.": 1,
    "I use them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature.": 1,
    " when a man named Hausdorff in 1919 introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke, and I found that this number was a good measurement of roughness.": 1,
    " When I first told it to my friends in mathematics, they said, don't be silly.": 1,
    "It's just something, well, actually, I was not silly.": 1,
    " Great painter Hokusai knew it very well.": 1,
    "The things on the ground are algae.": 1,
    "He did not know the mathematics.": 1,
    "It didn't exist.": 1,
    "And he was Japanese who didn't have no contact with the West.": 1,
    " But painting for a long time had a fractal side.": 1,
    "I could speak of that for a long time.": 1,
    "The Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect.": 1,
    "And I read the book that Mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower, and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood.": 1,
    " This is a mess, mess, mess Brian Loop.": 1,
    "One day I decided halfway through my career": 1,
    " I was helped by so many things in my work, I decided to test myself.": 1,
    "Could I just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time?": 1,
    " and find something geometrically new.": 1,
    "Well, so I looked at this thing called Brownian motion, which just goes around.": 1,
    "I made it": 1,
    " I played with it for a while, then it returned to the origin.": 1,
    "Then I was telling my assistant, I don't see anything.": 1,
    "Can you paint it?": 1,
    "So he painted it, which means that he put everything inside.": 1,
    "When this thing came out, I said, stop, stop, stop.": 1,
    " I see it in Ireland.": 1,
    " And then, amazing, so bar motion, which happens to have roughness of number of two, goes around, I measured it, 1.33, again, again, again, long measurements, big bar motion, 1.33.": 1,
    " Mathematical problem, how to prove it?": 1,
    "It took my friends 20 years.": 1,
    "Three of them were having incomplete proofs, they got together, and together they had a proof.": 1,
    " So they got a big medal in mathematics, one of the three medals that people received for proving things which I've seen without being able to prove them.": 1,
    " Now everybody asked me at one point or another, how did it all start?": 1,
    "What got you in that strange business?": 1,
    " What got you to be, at the same time, a mechanical engineer, a geographer, and a mathematician, and so on?": 1,
    "Well, actually, I started, oddly enough, studying stock market prices.": 1,
    " And so here I had developed this theory and I wrote books about it.": 1,
    " financial prices increments.": 1,
    "To the left, you see data over a long period.": 1,
    "To the right, on top, you see a theory which is very, very fashionable because it's very easy and you can write many books very fast about it.": 1,
    " So there are thousands of books on that.": 1,
    " Compare that with real price increments.": 1,
    "And where are real price increments?": 1,
    "Well, these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery, which I did.": 1,
    " So the idea there was that one must be able to model price variation.": 1,
    " And it went really well 50 years ago.": 1,
    "For 50 years, people were sort of poopooing because they could do it much, much easier.": 1,
    "But I tell you, at this point, people listened to me.": 1,
    " These two curves are averages, standard and poor, the blue one, and the red one is standard and poor, from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out.": 1,
    " Now discontinuities are a nuisance, so in all of many studies of prices, one puts them aside.": 1,
    "Well, acts of God.": 1,
    " And you have the little nonsense which is left.": 1,
    "The acts of God in this picture are, five acts of God are as important as everything else.": 1,
    "In other words, it is not acts of God which we can put aside, that is the meat, the problem.": 1,
    " If you master these, you master price, and if you don't master this, you can master the noise as well as you can, but it's not important.": 1,
    "Well, here are the curves for it.": 1,
    " Now, I get to the final thing, which is the set of which my name attached.": 1,
    "In a way, it's the story of my life.": 1,
    "My adolescence was spent during German occupation of France.": 1,
    " Since I thought that I might vanish within a day or a week, I had very big dreams.": 1,
    "After the war, I saw an uncle again.": 1,
    "My uncle was a very prominent mathematician and he told me,": 1,
    " There's a problem which I could not solve 25 years ago.": 1,
    " and which nobody can too solve, this is construction of Mandim, Julia and Nam-Patu.": 1,
    "If you could find something new, anything, you'll get your career made.": 1,
    "Very simple.": 1,
    " So I looked and like the thousands of people I tried before, I found nothing.": 1,
    " But then the computer came and I decided to apply computer not to new problems in mathematics, like this wiggle wiggle, that was a new problem, but to old problems.": 1,
    " and went from what's called real numbers, which is points in a line, to imagine complex numbers which are points in the plane.": 1,
    " which is what one should do there.": 1,
    "And this shape came out.": 1,
    "This shape is of an extraordinary complication.": 1,
    " The equation is written there.": 1,
    "z goes into z squared plus c. It's so simple, so dry, it's so uninteresting.": 1,
    "Now you turn the crank once, twice, twice.": 1,
    " marvels come out.": 1,
    "I mean, this comes out.": 1,
    "I don't want to explain these things.": 1,
    "Shapes which are of such complication, such harmony and such beauty.": 1,
    " This comes out repeatedly again, again, again.": 1,
    " And that was one of my major discoveries, to find that these islands were the same as the whole big thing, more or less.": 1,
    "And then you get these extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place.": 1,
    " All that from this little formula, which has whatever, five symbols in it.": 1,
    "And then this one, the color was added for two reasons.": 1,
    "First of all, because these shapes are so complicated,": 1,
    " that one couldn't make any sense of the numbers.": 1,
    "And if you plot them, you must choose some system.": 1,
    "And so my principle has been to always present these shapes": 1,
    " with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that and others emphasize that.": 1,
    "It's so complicated.": 1,
    " In 1990, I was in Cambridge, UK to receive a prize from the university.": 1,
    "And a few days later, a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing.": 1,
    " So, where did it come from?": 1,
    "Obviously from the extraterrestrials.": 1,
    "Well, so the newspaper in Cambridge published an article about that discovery and received the next day": 1,
    " 5,000 letters from people saying, but that's simply a Mandelbrot set, very big.": 1,
    "Well, let me finish.": 1,
    "This shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics.": 1,
    " Bottomless wonders spring from simple rules which are repeated without end.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
