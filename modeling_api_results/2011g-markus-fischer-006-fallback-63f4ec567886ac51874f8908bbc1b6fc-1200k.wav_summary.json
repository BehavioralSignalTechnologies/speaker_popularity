    " It is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird.": 1,
    "Birds are very agile.": 1,
    "They fly not with rotating components, so they fly only by flapping their wings.": 1,
    " So we looked at the birds and we tried to make a model that is powerful, ultra light, and it must have excellent aerodynamic qualities.": 1,
    " that would fly by its own and only by flapping its wings.": 1,
    "So what would be better to use the herring gull in its freedom circling and swooping over the sea and use this as a role model?": 1,
    " So we bring a team together.": 1,
    "There are generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics, in the field of building gliders, and the task was to build an ultralight indoor flying model.": 1,
    " that is able to fly over your head.": 1,
    "So be careful later on.": 1,
    "And...": 1,
    " This was one issue, to build it that lightweight that no one would be hurt if it fell down.": 1,
    "So why do we all this?": 1,
    "We are a company in the field of automation.": 1,
    " And we'd like to do very lightweight structures because that's energy efficient and we'd like to learn more about pneumatics and airflow phenomena.": 1,
    " to take your seat belts on and you put your hats off.": 1,
    "So maybe we'll try it once to fly a smart bird.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " you.": 1,
    " So we can now look at the smart bird.": 1,
    " So here is one without a skin.": 1,
    "We have a wind span of about two meters.": 1,
    "The length is one meter and six.": 1,
    "And the weight, it is only 450 grams.": 1,
    " and it is all out of carbon fiber.": 1,
    "In the middle we have a motor and we also have a gear in it.": 1,
    " and we use the gear to transfer the circulation of the motor.": 1,
    "So within the motor we have three hall sensors that we know exactly where the wing is.": 1,
    " And if we now keep up and down...": 1,
    " we have the possibility to fly like a bird.": 1,
    "So if you go down you have the large area of propulsion and if you go up...": 1,
    " The wings are not that large and it is easier to get up.": 1,
    " So the next thing we did or the challenge we did was to coordinate this movement.": 1,
    " We have to turn it, go up and go down.": 1,
    "We have a split wing.": 1,
    "With the split wing, we get the lift.": 1,
    " at the upper wing and we get the propulsion at the lower wing.": 1,
    "Also we see how we measure": 1,
    " the aerodynamic efficiency.": 1,
    "We had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency.": 1,
    " So therefore it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion from 30% up to 80%.": 1,
    " Next thing we have to do, we have to control and regulate the whole structure.": 1,
    "Only if you control and regulate it, you will get that aerodynamic deficiency.": 1,
    " So the overall consumption of energy is about 25 watts at takeoff and 16 to 80 watts in flight.": 1,
    " Marcos, I think that we should fly it once more.": 1,
    "Yes, sure.": 1
