    "Am I going to get wet?": 3,
    " I'm going to have a pretty simple idea that I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it.": 1,
    "And that's all of us are makers.": 1,
    "I really believe that.": 1,
    "All of us are makers.": 1,
    " We're born makers.": 1,
    "We have this ability to make things, to grasp things with our hands.": 1,
    "We use the words like grasp metaphorically to also think about understanding things.": 1,
    " We don't just live, but we make.": 1,
    "We create things.": 1,
    "Well, I'm going to show you a group of makers from Maker Faire and various places.": 1,
    "It doesn't come out particularly well, but that's a particularly tall bicycle, right?": 1,
    " It's a scraper bike, it's called, from Oakland.": 1,
    "And this is a particularly small scooter for the gentleman of this size, but he's trying to power it or motorize it with a drill, right?": 1,
    " And the question he had is, can I do it?": 1,
    "Can it be done?": 1,
    "Apparently it can.": 1,
    "So makers are enthusiasts.": 1,
    "They are amateurs.": 1,
    " They're people who love doing what they do.": 1,
    "They don't always even know why they're doing it.": 1,
    " We have begun organizing makers at our Maker Faire.": 1,
    "There was one held in Detroit here last summer and will be held again next summer at the Henry Ford.": 1,
    "But we hold them in San Francisco.": 1,
    "Yeah.": 1,
    " and in New York.": 1,
    "And it's a fabulous event to just meet and talk to these people who make things and are there to just show them to you and talk about them and have a great conversation.": 1,
    " These are electric muffins.": 1,
    " So I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out.": 1,
    "We got there first.": 1,
    " This is something I call swinging in the rain.": 1,
    "And if you can barely see it, but it's a controller at top cycles the water to fall just before and after you've passed through the bottom of the arc.": 1,
    "So imagine a kid, am I going to get wet?": 1,
    " No, I didn't get wet.": 1,
    "That's the experience of a kind of a clever ride.": 1,
    "And of course, we have fashion.": 1,
    "People are remaking things into fashion.": 1,
    "I don't know if this is called a basket bra, but it ought to be something like that.": 1,
    " We have art students getting together, taking old radiator parts and doing an iron pour to make something new out of it.": 1,
    "They did that in the summer and it was very warm.": 1,
    "Now this one takes a little bit explained.": 1,
    "You know what those are, right?": 1,
    " Billy Bob or something kind of Billy Bass or something like that.": 1,
    "All right.": 1,
    "Now the background is the guy who did this is a physicist.": 1,
    " All right, and here he'll explain a little bit about what it does.": 1,
    "I'm Richard Carter, and this is the Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.": 1,
    "This is all computer controlled in an old Volvo.": 1,
    " Bye!": 1,
    " What's that feeling?": 1,
    "I'm higher than leaving.": 1,
    "That's how you raise up with me.": 1,
    " So Richard came up from Houston last year to visit us in Detroit here and show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.": 1,
    " So are you a maker?": 1,
    "How many people here would say you're a maker?": 1,
    "If you raise your hand.": 1,
    "That's a pretty good, but there's some of you out there that won't admit that you're makers.": 1,
    "And again, think about it.": 1,
    "You're makers of food.": 1,
    " You're makers of shelter.": 1,
    "You're makers of lots of different things.": 1,
    "And partly what interests me today is you're makers of your own world, and particularly the role that technology has in your life.": 1,
    " You know, you're really a driver or a passenger to use a Volkswagen phrase.": 1,
    "You know, makers are in control.": 1,
    "That's what fascinates them.": 1,
    "That's why they do what they do.": 1,
    "They want to figure out how things work.": 1,
    "They want to get access to it and they want to control it.": 1,
    "They want to use it.": 1,
    " to their own purpose.": 1,
    "You know, makers today, to some degree, are out on the edge.": 1,
    "They're not mainstream.": 1,
    "They're a little bit radical.": 1,
    "They're a bit subversive in what they do.": 1,
    "But at one time,": 1,
    " It was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker.": 1,
    "It was not something you'd even remark upon.": 1,
    "And I found this old video, and I'll tell you more about it.": 1,
    " you": 1,
    " Of all things Americans are, we are makers.": 1,
    " With our strengths and our minds and spirit, we gather, we form, and we fashion.": 1,
    "Makers and shapers and put-it-togetherers.": 1,
    " So it goes on to show you people making things out of wood, a grandfather making a ship in a bottle, a woman making a pie, somewhat standard fare of the day.": 1,
    " But it was a sense of pride that we made things, that the world around us was made by us.": 1,
    " It didn't just exist, we made it and we were connected to it that way.": 1,
    "And I think that's tremendously important.": 1,
    "Now I'm going to tell you one funny thing about this.": 1,
    " This particular reel, it's an industrial video, but it was shown in drive-in theaters in 1961 in the Detroit area, in fact, and it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.": 1,
    " So I like to think there was something going on there of the new generation of makers coming out of this plus psycho.": 1,
    "This is Andrew Archer.": 1,
    " I met Andrew at one of our community meetings and putting together Maker Faire.": 1,
    "Andrew had moved to Detroit from Duluth, Minnesota.": 1,
    " As I talk to his mom, and I end up doing a story on him for our magazine called Kid Robot, and he's just a kid that grew up": 1,
    " playing with tools instead of toys.": 1,
    "He liked to take things apart.": 1,
    "His mother gave him a part of the garage and he collected things from yard sales and he made stuff.": 1,
    " And then he didn't particularly like school that much, but he got involved in robotics competitions, and he realized he had a talent, and more importantly, he had a real passion for it.": 1,
    " And he began building robots and when I sat down next to him, he was telling me at a company he formed and he was building some robots for automobile factories to move things around on the factory floor.": 1,
    "And that's why he moved to Michigan.": 1,
    "But he also": 1,
    " moved here to meet other people doing what he's doing.": 1,
    "And this kind of gets to this important idea today.": 1,
    "This is Jeff and Bilal and several others here in a hacker space.": 1,
    " And there's about three hacker spaces or more in Detroit, and it's probably even some new ones since I've been here last.": 1,
    "But these are like clubs.": 1,
    "They're sharing tools, sharing space, sharing expertise in what to make.": 1,
    " It's a very interesting phenomenon that's going across the world.": 1,
    "But essentially, these are people that are playing with technology.": 1,
    "Let me say that again.": 1,
    "Playing.": 1,
    "They don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it.": 1,
    "They're playing to discover": 1,
    " what the technology can do, and probably to discover what they can do themselves, what their own capabilities are.": 1,
    " Now, the other thing that I think is taking off or another reason making is taking off today is there's some great new tools out there.": 1,
    "And you can't see this very well on the screen, but Arduino.": 1,
    "Arduino is an open source hardware platform.": 1,
    "It's a microcontroller.": 1,
    " If you don't know what those are, they're just the brains.": 1,
    "So they're the brains of maker projects.": 1,
    "And here's an example of one, and I don't know if you can see it that well, but that's a mailbox.": 1,
    "So an ordinary mailbox in an Arduino.": 1,
    " So you figure out how to program this and you put this in your mailbox.": 1,
    "And when someone opens your mailbox, you get a notification, an alert message goes to your iPhone.": 1,
    " Now, that could be a dog door.": 1,
    "It could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't, like a little brother into a little sister's room.": 1,
    "There's all kinds of different things that you could imagine for that.": 1,
    "Now, here's something, a 3D printer.": 1,
    " That's another tool that's really taken off, really, really interesting.": 1,
    "This is MakerBot.": 1,
    "And there are industrial versions of this, about $20,000.": 1,
    " These guys came up with a kit version for $750, and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3D printers.": 1,
    "Now they don't know what they want to do with it, but they're going to figure it out.": 1,
    " They'll only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it.": 1,
    "One of the coolest things is MakerBot sent out an upgrade, some new brackets for the box.": 1,
    "Well, you printed out the brackets and then replaced the old brackets with the new ones.": 1,
    " Isn't that cool?": 1,
    " So makers harvest technology from all the places around us.": 1,
    "This is a radar speed detector that is developed from a Hot Wheels toy.": 1,
    " And they do interesting things.": 1,
    "They're really creating new areas and exploring areas that you might only think, you know, the military is doing drones.": 1,
    "Well, there's a whole community of people building autonomous airplanes or vehicles.": 1,
    " Something that you could program to fly on its own without the stick or anything to figure out what path it's going.": 1,
    "Fascinating work they're doing.": 1,
    "We just had an issue on space exploration, DIY space exploration.": 1,
    " This is probably the best time in the history of mankind to love space.": 1,
    " You could build your own satellite and get it into space for like $8,000.": 1,
    "Think how much money and how many years it took NASA to get satellites into space.": 1,
    " In fact, these guys actually work for NASA, and they're trying to pioneer using off-the-shelf components, cheap things that aren't specialized, that they can combine and send up into space.": 1,
    " Makers are a source of innovation.": 1,
    "I think it relates back to something like the birth of the personal computer industry.": 1,
    "This is Steve Wozniak.": 1,
    "Where does he learn about computers?": 1,
    "It's the homebrew computer club, just like a hacker space.": 1,
    "And he says, you know, I could go there all day long": 1,
    " and talk to people and share ideas for free.": 1,
    "Well, he did a little bit better than free, but it's important to understand that a lot of the origins of our industries": 1,
    " even like Henry Ford, come from this idea of playing and figuring things out in groups.": 1,
    "Well, if I haven't convinced you that you're a maker, I hope I could convince you that our next generation should be makers, that kids": 1,
    " are particularly interested in this, in this ability to control the physical world and be able to use things like microcontrollers and build robots.": 1,
    " And we've got to get this into schools or into communities in many, many ways.": 1,
    "The ability to tinker, to shape and reshape the world around us.": 1,
    " There's a great opportunity today, and that's what I really care about the most.": 1,
    "The answer to the question of what will America make, it's more makers.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
