    " I grew up in Europe and World War II caught me when I was between seven and ten years old.": 1,
    " realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew": 1,
    " were able to withstand the tragedies that were visited on them, how few of them could": 1,
    " even resemble a normal, contented, satisfied, happy life once they're": 1,
    " job, their home, their security was destroyed by the war.": 1,
    "So I became interested in understanding what": 1,
    " contributed to a life that was worth living.": 1,
    "And I tried as a child, as a teenager, to read philosophy and to get involved in art and": 1,
    " religion and many other ways that I could see as a possible answer to that question.": 1,
    "And finally I ended up": 1,
    " encountering psychology by chance.": 1,
    "Actually, I was at a ski resort in Switzerland without any money to actually enjoy myself because the": 1,
    " the snow had melted and there was, I didn't have money to go to a movie, but I found that reading the newspapers that there was to be a": 1,
    " presentation by someone in a place that seemed in the center of Zurich.": 1,
    " And it was about flying saucers, he was going to talk.": 1,
    "And I thought, well, since I can't go to the movies, at least I will go.": 1,
    " for free to listen to flying saucers.": 1,
    "And the man who talked at that": 1,
    " uh... evening uh... lecture uh... was very interesting and it actually instead of talking about little green man he talked about": 1,
    " how the psyche of the Europeans had been traumatized by the war and now they are projecting flying saucers into the sky kind of as a": 1,
    " He talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion were kind of projected into the sky.": 1,
    " as an attempt to regain some sense of order after the chaos of war.": 1,
    " And this seemed very interesting to me.": 1,
    "And I started reading his books after that lecture.": 1,
    "And that was Carl Jung, whose name or work I had no idea about.": 1,
    " Then I came to this country to study psychology and I started trying to understand": 1,
    " the roots of happiness.": 1,
    "This is a typical result that many people have presented and there are many variations on it, but this for instance shows that": 1,
    " About 30% of the people surveyed in the United States since 1956 say that": 1,
    " their life is very happy.": 1,
    "And that hasn't changed at all, whereas the personal income on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation,": 1,
    " has more than doubled, almost tripled in that period.": 1,
    "But you find essentially the same results, namely that": 1,
    " After a certain basic point, which corresponds more or less to just a few thousand dollars above the minimum poverty level, increases in material well-being don't seem to affect how": 1,
    " happy people are.": 1,
    "And in fact, you can find that the lack of basic resources, material resources,": 1,
    " contributes to unhappiness, but the increase in material resources do not increase happiness.": 1,
    " So my research has been focused more on after": 1,
    " finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience.": 1,
    "I try to understand now, where in everyday life, in our": 1,
    " normal experience, do we feel really happy?": 1,
    "And to start those studies about 40 years ago, I began to look at creative": 1,
    " people, first artists and scientists and so forth, trying to understand what made them feel that it was worth": 1,
    " essentially spending their life doing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune, but which made their life meaningful and worth": 1,
    " This was one of the leading composers of American music back in the 70s.": 1,
    " And the interview was 40 pages long, but this little excerpt is a very good summary of what he was saying during the interview, and it describes how he feels": 1,
    " when composing is going well.": 1,
    "And he starts by describing it as an ecstatic state.": 1,
    "Now, ecstasy in Greek meant simply to stand to the side of something.": 1,
    "And then it became": 1,
    " essentially an analogy for a mental state where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines.": 1,
    " So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality.": 1,
    "And it's interesting if you think about it how": 1,
    " When we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement, whether it's China, Greece, a Hindu civilization, or the Mayas, or": 1,
    " Egyptians, what we know about them is really about their ecstasy.": 1,
    "It's not about their everyday life.": 1,
    "We know the temples they built so where people could come to experience a different reality.": 1,
    " We know about the circuses, the arenas, the theaters.": 1,
    "These are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went to": 1,
    " experience life in a more concentrated, more ordered form.": 1,
    " Now, this man doesn't need to go to a place like this, which is also this place, this arena, which is built like a Greek amphitheater.": 1,
    " is a place for ecstasy also.": 1,
    "We are participating in a reality which is different from that of everyday life that we're used to.": 1,
    "But this man doesn't need to go there.": 1,
    "He needs just a piece of paper": 1,
    " where he can put down little marks.": 1,
    "And as he does that, he can imagine sounds that had not existed before in that particular combination.": 1,
    " Once he gets to that point of beginning to create, like Jennifer did in her improvisation, a new reality, that is a moment of ecstasy.": 1,
    "He enters that different reality.": 1,
    " Now, he says also that this is so intense an experience that it feels almost as if it didn't exist.": 1,
    "And that sounds like...": 1,
    " a kind of a romantic exaggeration.": 1,
    "But actually, our nervous system is incapable of processing more than about 110 bits of information per second.": 1,
    " In order to hear me and understand what I'm saying, you need to process about 60 bits per second.": 1,
    "That's why you can't hear more than two people.": 1,
    "You can't understand more than two people talking to you.": 1,
    " Well, when you are really involved in this completely engaging process of creating something new, as this man does,": 1,
    " He doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor how his body feels or his problems at home.": 1,
    "He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired.": 1,
    " His body disappears, his identity disappears from his consciousness because he doesn't have enough attention like none of us do.": 1,
    " to really do well, something that requires a lot of concentration, and at the same time to feel that he exists.": 1,
    "So existence temporarily suspended.": 1,
    " And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself.": 1,
    " I could...": 1,
    " I could look at my hand for two weeks, and I wouldn't feel any awe and wonder, because I can't compose.": 1,
    "So what he's not telling you here, but in other parts of the interview, is that obviously this": 1,
    " automatic, spontaneous process that is describing can only happen to someone who is": 1,
    " very well trained and who has developed technique.": 1,
    "And it has become a kind of a": 1,
    " True is, in the study of creativity, that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years of": 1,
    " technical knowledge immersion in a particular field.": 1,
    "Whether it's mathematics or music, it takes that long to be able to": 1,
    " begin to change something in a way that it's better than what was there before.": 1,
    "Now, when that happens, he says,": 1,
    " the music just flows out.": 1,
    "And because all of these people I started interviewing, this was an interview which is over 30 years old.": 1,
    " So many of the people describe this as a spontaneous flow that I call this type of experience, the flow experience.": 1,
    "And it happens in different realms.": 1,
    "For instance, a poet describes it": 1,
    " in this form.": 1,
    "This is by a student of mine who interviewed some of the leading writers and poets in the United States and it describes": 1,
    " the same effortless, spontaneous feeling that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.": 1,
    "This poet describes it as opening a door that floats up in the sky.": 1,
    " Very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave as to how he imagined the forces of relativity when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked.": 1,
    " But it happens in other activities.": 1,
    "For instance, this is another student of mine, Susan Jackson from Australia, who did work with some of the leading athletes in the world.": 1,
    " You see here in this description of an Olympic skater the same essential description of the phenomenology of the inner state of the person.": 1,
    "You don't think it goes automatically.": 1,
    "You merge yourself with the music and so forth.": 1,
    " It happens also actually in the most recent book I wrote called Good Business where I interviewed some of the CEOs.": 1,
    " who have been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical, very socially responsible.": 1,
    "You see that these people define success as": 1,
    " something that helps others and at the same time makes you feel happy as you are working at it.": 1,
    "And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say,": 1,
    " You can't have just one of these things to be successful.": 1,
    "If you want a meaningful job and successful job, Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs.": 1,
    " we interviewed.": 1,
    "She is the founder of Body Shop, the cosmetic, kind of natural cosmetic thing.": 1,
    "It's kind of a passion that comes from doing the best and having flow while you're working.": 1,
    " This is an interesting little quote from Masaru Ibuka who was at that time starting out Sony without any money, without a product.": 1,
    "They didn't have a product, they didn't have anything, but they had an idea.": 1,
    " And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovation, be aware of their mission to society.": 1,
    " and work to their heart's content.": 1,
    "I couldn't improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace.": 1,
    "Now, when we do studies, we have": 1,
    " with other colleagues around the world, done over 8,000 interviews of people from Dominican monks to blind nuns to Himalayan climbers.": 1,
    " to Navajo shepherds who enjoy their work.": 1,
    "And regardless of the culture, regardless of education or whatever, there are these seven": 1,
    " conditions that seem to be there when a person is in flow.": 1,
    "There's this focus that once it becomes": 1,
    " intense, leads a sense of ecstasy, a sense of clarity.": 1,
    "You know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other.": 1,
    "You get immediate feedback.": 1,
    "You know that what you need to do is possible to do even though difficult.": 1,
    " And sense of time disappears.": 1,
    "You forget yourself.": 1,
    "You feel part of something larger.": 1,
    "And once those conditions are present, what you're doing becomes": 1,
    " worth doing for its own sake.": 1,
    "In our studies, we represent the everyday life of people in this simple scheme.": 1,
    " And we can measure this very precisely, actually, because we give people electronic pages that go off 10 times a day.": 1,
    "And whenever they go off, you say what you're doing, how you feel.": 1,
    " where you are, what you're thinking about.": 1,
    "And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge people experience at that moment and the amount of skills that they feel they have at that moment.": 1,
    " So for each person, we can establish an average, which is the center of the diagram.": 1,
    "That would be your mean level of challenge and skill, which will be different from that of anybody else, but you have a kind of a set point there.": 1,
    " which would be in the middle.": 1,
    "If we know what that set point is, we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow.": 1,
    "And it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average.": 1,
    " And you may be doing things very differently from other people.": 1,
    "But for everyone, that flow channel, that area there, will be when you are doing what you really like to do.": 1,
    "Play the piano.": 1,
    " Probably.": 1,
    "Be with your best friend.": 1,
    "Perhaps work, if work is what provides flow for you.": 1,
    " And then the other areas become less and less positive.": 1,
    "Arousal is still good because you are over...": 1,
    " challenge there.": 1,
    "Your skills are not quite as high as they should be, but you can move into flow fairly easily by just developing a little more skill.": 1,
    " So arousal is the area where most people learn from, because that's where they are pushed beyond their comfort zone.": 1,
    " to enter, going back to flow, then they develop higher skills.": 1,
    "Control is also a good place to be because": 1,
    " There you feel comfortable, but not very excited.": 1,
    "It's not very challenging anymore.": 1,
    "And if you want to enter flow from control, you have to increase the challenges.": 1,
    " So those two are ideal and complementary areas from which flow is easy to go into.": 1,
    " The other combinations of challenge and skill become progressively less optimal.": 1,
    "Relaxation is fine, you still feel okay.": 1,
    "Boredom begins to be very aversive.": 1,
    " Appetite becomes very negative.": 1,
    "You don't feel that you're doing anything.": 1,
    "You don't use your skills.": 1,
    "There's no challenge.": 1,
    "Unfortunately, a lot of": 1,
    " People's experience is inappetite.": 1,
    " contributor to that experience is watching television.": 1,
    "The next one is being in the bathroom sitting.": 1,
    " And then even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow, but that's when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get": 1,
    " feedback from it.": 1,
    "So the question we are trying to address, and I'm way over time, is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel.": 1,
    " That is the kind of challenge that we are trying to understand.": 1,
    "And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously without any advice.": 1,
    "But unfortunately, a lot of people don't.": 1,
    "And that's what our": 1,
    " mandate is in a way to do.": 1
