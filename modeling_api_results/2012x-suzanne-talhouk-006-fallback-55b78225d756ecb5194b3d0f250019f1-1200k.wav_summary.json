    " Right, Zaheel?": 1,
    "They took my card, but I wanted to ask you, who wrote their name in Arabic on the card?": 1,
    " One without one.": 1,
    "Very nice.": 1,
    "Not a problem.": 1,
    "This place was not in the old days.": 1,
    "My friend and I are sitting in a restaurant and we are ordering food.": 1,
    " So I looked at the person who was helping us and I told him, do you have any food?": 1,
    " He looked at me like that and thought he heard me wrong.": 1,
    "He said, sorry.": 1,
    "I said, why did you cut the food if you didn't cut it?": 1,
    " You don't know what they're saying?": 1,
    " The love.": 1,
    " No, they call it menu or menu in French.": 1,
    "Let's see what it wants.": 1,
    " that while he was trying to push me to the point where if the last girl in the world doesn't look at her, what's the point of eating?": 1,
    " Two words.": 1,
    "Let a Lebanese young man judge a young man who is sitting next to him with a disability, with ignorance,": 1,
    " How can you say such a thing?": 1,
    " So here, I started to think.": 1,
    "I'm in my country.": 1,
    "I'm not allowed to speak my language.": 1,
    "Where does that happen?": 1,
    " Why can they reach this stage?": 1,
    "We are here, and there are many like us.": 1,
    "Can they reach a stage in their lives where they erase everything that happened before?": 1,
    " just to say that they are modern and that they are prepared.": 1,
    "I want to forget all of my culture, all of my ideas, all of my ideas.": 1,
    " All the memories I have, maybe the best memories from the war are childhood stories.": 1,
    "I want to forget everything I learned in Arabic, just to get into the mood, just to be that I am a woman.": 1,
    " Where is the logic?": 1,
    "With all this, I tried to understand him.": 1,
    "And I don't want to judge him in the same way he judged me.": 1,
    " Arabic language doesn't get messed up.": 1,
    "It doesn't get messed up.": 1,
    "It's not a scientific production language, or a research, or a language that you learn at university, or a language that we learn at work, or a language that we learn when we want to do...": 1,
    " Any advanced scientific research, and of course the language we practice at the airport, because if we speak Arabic, they will take our clothes off.": 1,
    " Where should we use it?": 1,
    "We can all say this question.": 1,
    "Do you want the Arabic language?": 1,
    "Where should we use it?": 1,
    " This reality exists, but we have another reality that we need to think about and pay attention to.": 1,
    " Arabic or mother tongue, researchers say that the perfection of other languages requires the perfection of mother tongue.": 1,
    " As for creativity in other languages, it is an essential condition for the perfection of mother tongue.": 1,
    "How?": 1,
    "Gebran, Khalil Gebran.": 1,
    " When he started writing, he started writing in Arabic.": 1,
    " All of his ideas, all of his imagination, all of his innermost thoughts, all of his philosophies, he brought from this child who is living in the village, who has a certain smell, a certain voice, a certain idea.": 1,
    " So as soon as he started writing in English, he had a lot of ideas.": 1,
    "Even when he was writing in English, when we read it to him, we smell the same scent.": 1,
    " We feel the same feeling.": 1,
    "We can imagine that he is the same.": 1,
    "He is the same who is coming from the mountains, from a village in the Lebanese mountains.": 1,
    " So this is an example.": 1,
    "No one can say that it is not correct.": 1,
    " Second, they say that if you want to kill people, the only way to kill people is to kill language.": 1,
    " And this reality is known to the developed nations.": 1,
    "The Germans, the French, the Japanese, the Chinese, all the nations know this reality.": 1,
    " That's why the laws are made to protect our language.": 1,
    "That's why this language is sacred.": 1,
    "That's why it's produced.": 1,
    "It pays a lot of money to develop it.": 1,
    " Do we know more than them?": 1,
    "If we are not the first world and we have not reached this developed idea and we want to follow this prepared world,": 1,
    " Countries like ours, which have decided to develop, research, and follow these countries, such as Turkey, Malaysia, and others,": 1,
    " They are the ones who carried their language and went out on this path, like the scholars.": 1,
    "They preserved it.": 1,
    "Keep it with them.": 1,
    "Because if any product comes to you from Turkey or other countries, it is not written in Turkish.": 1,
    " It's not a local product.": 1,
    "You won't believe it's a local product.": 1,
    "It will be worth it again.": 1,
    " And they used it in a stupid way, as we are doing three quarters of the time.": 1,
    "So to be creative and to survive, they had to preserve their language.": 1,
    " If you want, freedom, sovereignty, independence.": 1,
    "What do you remember?": 1,
    " Don't you remember anything?": 1,
    "Regardless of who, how, and why, I will ask him.": 1,
    " The language is not just words that come out of your mouth.": 1,
    "The language represents stages": 1,
    " And that's why when we say freedom is independence, each one of you has a picture that comes to mind.": 1,
    " There are certain words, a certain feeling, a certain day, a certain historical period.": 1,
    "Language is not a word, a letter, two or three lines.": 1,
    "It is an idea inside.": 1,
    " How do we think, how do we see the other person, how does the other person see us?": 1,
    "Why do we say that this person understands and that person doesn't?": 1,
    " So, if I told you about freedom, sovereignty became true.": 1,
    "Independence.": 1,
    " If your son came and told you, Oh dad, you were in this thing that has freedom and the slogan of the future, how would you feel?": 1,
    " If you can feel it, if we can feel it very well, we don't have a problem.": 1,
    "Let me walk from here.": 1,
    "I was talking about space.": 1,
    "The idea is...": 1,
    " that these statues remind us of something specific.": 1,
    " I have a French-speaking friend who is married to a French man.": 1,
    "I was asking her how and what, and she told me that everything is fine.": 1,
    " But one night, I spent the whole night asking him, trying to translate to him, what does it mean to pass me by?": 1,
    "I went and told him.": 1,
    " I went to Muattara and told him to pass me by by mistake.": 1,
    "He thought that I was a monster or that I wanted to commit suicide.": 1,
    " This is a very small thing.": 1,
    "Look how much it makes us feel that I can't say this to my husband because I won't be able to say it to him.": 1,
    "He thinks like this.": 1,
    " And she told me that he listens to Fairouz with me, but there is one girl who is trying to tell him to translate it, even though I feel it when I listen to Fairouz.": 1,
    " I want to translate the meaning of the sentence, from them you extended your hand and stole.": 1,
    " And because you have them, here's the chair.": 1,
    "You returned them to me and left you.": 1,
    " Tarj Mool Naye.": 1,
    " So, what did we do to preserve the Arabic language?": 1,
    " We turned this topic into a matter of civil society.": 1,
    "And we launched the campaign to preserve the Arabic language, even though many people asked me, what do you want with this thing?": 1,
    "Go have fun and enjoy it.": 1,
    "What do you want with this headache?": 1,
    " No problem.": 1,
    "Your campaign to preserve the Arabic language has launched a slogan that says, I'll tell you from the East, you'll reply from the West.": 1,

    "Wa nahnu hadhihil lugha wa nahnu na'amal wa...": 1,

    "When someone tells me this, I hate it in Arabic.": 1,
    "We are saying...": 1,
    " We want to see what we are living in reality and be convinced of a way to talk about our dreams, our daily lives and our ambitions.": 1,
    "A way to wear the same clothes we wear and think in the same way we think.": 1,
    " So I tell you that the street responds that the stranger put her finger on the wound.": 1,
    "Something very easy, but creative and convincing.": 1,
    "After that...": 1,
    " We also organized a campaign, which contains scenes of the letters on the streets.": 1,
    "You saw something outside of them.": 1,
    "A scene, a letter, and there are yellow and black stripes around it.": 1,
    "It's written on it, don't kill your tongue.": 1,
    " Why?": 1,
    "Don't you really kill your language?": 1,
    "Shouldn't we all kill our language?": 1,
    " Because if we kill the language, we will search for identity.": 1,
    "We will search for existence.": 1,
    "We will start from zero.": 1,

    "We are very cool.": 1,
    " And those who say that I spoke an English word, I don't believe it.": 1,
    "No.": 1,
    "I accept the word to speak.": 1,
    " Let them come and do what they want.": 1,
    "Give me a better word than that.": 1,
    "And fix it if we fall more than that.": 1,
    "I will stay on the internet.": 1,
    "I will not say that I am going to the internet.": 1,
    " that it's not right to laugh at ourselves, but to be able to reach this point, all of us should be happy.": 1,
    "We don't want to make the biggest": 1,
    " and to think that he has the power over the language so that he can make us feel and think what he wants.": 1,
    " So, the idea, guys, is creativity.": 1,
    "If we can't go to space and make a rocket, I don't know what else we can do.": 1,
    "Each one of you here is a creative project.": 1,
    " The creativity in the mother tongue is the way.": 1,

    "Let's make a short film.": 1,
    "A single novel can bring us back to the world.": 1,
    "It can make the Arabic language return to the first place.": 1,
    " So there is no solution.": 1,

    "Either in Arabic, English, French, or Chinese.": 1,
    "But don't write MA3 to OUF.": 1,
    " Because it's Kersi.": 1,
    "Because this is not a language.": 1,
    "I mean, here you enter into a virtual world, a virtual language, and no one will ever take us away from this place.": 1,
    " So this is the first thing we can do.": 1,
    "The second thing is that there are many things we can do.": 1,
    "Today, no one is here to convince anyone.": 1,
    "They are here to warn us that we must preserve this topic.": 1,
    "And now, I will tell you a secret.": 1,
    " The child who is born, the first way to know his father, is through language.": 1,
