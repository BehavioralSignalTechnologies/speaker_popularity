    " There is nothing bigger or older than the universe.": 1,
    " The questions I would like to talk about are...": 1,
    " One.": 1,
    " Where did we come from?": 1,
    " How did the universe come into being?": 1,
    " Are we alone in the universe?": 1,
    "Is there alien life out there?": 1,
    "What is the future of the human race?": 1,
    " Up until the 1920s, everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time.": 1,
    " Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding.": 1,
    " Distant galaxies were moving away from us.": 1,
    " This meant they must have been closer together in the past.": 1,
    " If we extrapolate back, we find they must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago.": 1,
    " This was the Big Bang, the beginning of the universe.": 1,
    " But was there anything before the Big Bang?": 1,
    " If not, what created the universe?": 1,
    "Why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did?": 1,
    " We used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts.": 1,
    " First there were the laws like Maxwell's equations in general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe, given its state over all space at one time.": 1,
    " On second, there was the question of the initial state of the universe.": 1,
    " We have made good progress on the first part, and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions.": 1,
    " But until recently, we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe.": 1,
    " However, this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct.": 1,
    " Under extreme conditions, general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space.": 1,
    " This removes the distinction between time and space and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state.": 1,
    " The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing.": 1,
    " Moreover, we can calculate the probabilities that the universe has created in different states.": 1,
    " These predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background, which is an imprint of the very early universe.": 1,
    " We think we have solved the mystery of creation.": 1,
    "Maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence.": 1,
    " I now turn to the second big question.": 1,
    "Are we alone, or is there other life in the universe?": 1,
    " We believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth, so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets, of which there seemed to be a large number in the galaxy.": 1,
    " But we don't know how life first appeared.": 1,
    " We have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing.": 1,
    " The first is that we have hostile sociology from 3.5 billion years ago.": 1,
    " The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years.": 1,
    " So life appeared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible, which is short compared to the 10 billion year lifetime of a planet of Earth type.": 1,
    " This suggests that the probability of life appearing is recently high.": 1,
    " If it was very low, one would have expected it to take most of the 10 billion years available.": 1,
    " On the other hand, we don't seem to have been visited by aliens.": 1,
    " I am discounting reports of UFOs.": 1,
    " Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos?": 1,
    " If there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring, it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far.": 1,
    " Furthermore, despite an extensive search by the SETI project, we haven't heard any alien television quiz shows.": 1,
    " This probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years.": 1,
    " Issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet.": 1,
    " This brings me to the last of the big questions, the future of the human race.": 1,
    "If we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy, we should make sure we survive and continue.": 1,
    " But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history.": 1,
    " Our population and our use of the finite resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially, along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill.": 1,
    " But our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past.": 1,
    " It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years, let alone the next thousand or million.": 1,
    " Our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward looking on planet Earth, but to spread out into space.": 1,
    " The answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years.": 1,
    " But if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years, our future is in space.": 1,
    " That is why I'm in favor of manned, or should I say, personned, space flight.": 1,
    " All my life, I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions.": 1,
    " I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap.": 1,
    "Indeed, it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge.": 1,
    " The ultimate goal is the complete theory of the universe, and we are making good progress.": 1,
    " Thank you for listening.": 1,
    " Professor, if you had to guess either way, do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are alone in the Milky Way as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher?": 1,
    " This answer took seven minutes and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for Ted.": 1,
    " I think it's quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years.": 1,
    "Otherwise, we would have heard radio waves.": 1,
    " The alternative is that civilizations don't last very long, but destroy themselves.": 1,
    " Professor Hawking, thank you for that answer.": 1,
    "We will take it as a salutary warning I think for the rest of our conference this week.": 1,
    " Professor, we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today.": 1,
    "Thank you very much indeed.": 1
