    " When I saw a piece of technology called Kinect, it was called Natal, I was inspired and I thought for a moment maybe it's possible to address that one problem of storytelling.": 1,
    " to create a character which seemed alive, which noticed me, that could look me in the eyes.": 1,
    " and feel real and sculpt a story about our relationship.": 1,
    "And so, a year ago, I showed this off at a computer show called E3.": 1,
    " And this was a piece of technology of someone called Claire interacting with this boy.": 1,
    "And there was a huge row online about, hey, this can't be real.": 1,
    "And so I waited till now.": 1,
    " to have an actual demo of the real tech.": 1,
    "Now this tech incorporates three big elements.": 1,
    "The first is a Kinect camera, which will be out in November.": 1,
    " some incredible AI that was hidden in the dusty vaults, collecting dust in Microsoft.": 1,
    " plus our quite crude attempts at AI at a company called Lionhead, mixing all those things together just to get to this one simple idea.": 1,
    " create a real living being in a computer.": 1,
    "Now, I'll be honest with you and say that most of it is just a trick.": 1,
    " But it's a trick that actually works.": 1,
    "So why don't we go over and have a look at the demo now.": 1,
    "This is Dimitri.": 1,
    "Dimitri, just waggle your arm around.": 1,
    " Now you notice he's sitting, there are no controllers, no keyboards or mice or joysticks or joy pads.": 1,
    " He is just going to use his hand, his body, and his voice just like humans interact with their hands, body, and voice.": 1,
    "So let's move forward.": 1,
    "You're going to meet Milo for the first time.": 1,
    " We had to give him a problem because when we first created Milo, we realised that he came across a little bit of a brat, to be honest with you.": 1,
    "He was quite know-it-all and he wanted to kind of make you laugh.": 1,
    " So the problem we introduced to him was this, he's just moved house.": 1,
    "He's moved from London to New England over in America.": 1,
    "His parents are too busy.": 1,
    " to listen to his problems and that's when he starts almost conjuring you up.": 1,
    "So here he is walking through the grass and you're able to interact with his world.": 1,
    "The cool thing is": 1,
    " What we're doing is we're changing the mind of Milo constantly.": 1,
    "That means no two people's Milos can be the same.": 1,
    "You're actually sculpting a human being here.": 1,
    " So he's discovering the garden, you're helping him discover the garden by just pointing out these snails.": 1,
    " Very simple at the start.": 1,
    "By the way, if you are a boy, it's snails.": 1,
    "If you're a girl, it's butterflies.": 1,
    "Because what we found was that girls hate snails.": 1,
    " So remember, this is the first time you've met him.": 1,
    "We really want to draw you in and make you more curious.": 1,
    " His face, by the way, is fully AI driven.": 1,
    "We have complete control over his blush responses, the diameter of his nostrils to denote stress.": 1,
    " We actually do something called body matching.": 1,
    "If you're leaning forward, he will slightly change the neuro-linguistic nature of his face.": 1,
    " Because we went out with this strong idea, how can we make you believe that something is real?": 1,
    "Now we've used a hand, the other thing to use is your body.": 1,
    " Why not just, instead of using, pushing left and right with a mouse or with a joy pad, why not use your body just to lean on the chair?": 1,
    "Again, relaxed.": 1,
    "You can lean back.": 1,
    " But the camera will change its perspective depending on which way you're looking.": 1,
    " So Dimitri is now going to use, he's used his hand, he's used his body, he's now going to use the other thing which is essential, and that's his voice.": 1,
    " The thing about voice is our experience with voice recognition is pretty awful, isn't it?": 1,
    "It never works.": 1,
    "You order a layer-line ticket, you end up in Timbuktu.": 1,
    " That's the biggest one yet.": 1,
    "So we've tackled that problem and we've come up with a solution which we'll see in a second.": 1,
    "I could just squish it.": 1,
    " What are you going to do?": 1,
    "Squashing a snail may not seem important but remember even this choice will affect how Milo develops.": 1,
    " Do you want Milo to squash it?": 1,
    "When you see the microphone, say yes.": 1,
    "Squash.": 1,
    "Go on Milo, squash it.": 1,
    " No, that's the right thing to do.": 1,
    " Now look at his response, he said, go on Milo, squash it.": 1,
    "What we're using there is we're using something, a piece of technology called Tell Me, it's a company that Microsoft acquired some years ago.": 1,
    " We've got a database of words which we recognize.": 1,
    "We pick those words out.": 1,
    "We also reference that with the tonation database that we build up of Demetri's voice or the user's voice.": 1,
    " Now we need to have a bit more engagement and again what we can do is we can look at the body and we'll do that in a second.": 1,
    " deep.": 1,
    " Okay, so what we're going to do now is teach Milo to skim stones.": 1,
    "We're actually teaching him.": 1,
    "It's very, very interesting how the men more than women tend to be more competitive here.": 1,
    " They're fine with teaching Milo for the first few throws, but then they want to beat Milo.": 1,
    "Where women, they're more nurturing about this.": 1,
    " Okay, this is skimming stones.": 1,
    "How do you skim stones?": 1,
    "You stand up.": 1,
    " and you skim the stone.": 1,
    "It's that simple.": 1,
    "Just recognizing your body, recognizing the body's motions, the tech understanding that you've gone from sitting down to standing up.": 1,
    " Again, all of this is done in the way us humans do things, and that's crucially important if we want Milo to appear real.": 1,
    "See if you can inspire him to do any better.": 1,
    " Try hitting the boat.": 1,
    " So close.": 1,
    " That's Demetrius' most competitive.": 1,
    "You've now beaten an 11-year-old child.": 1,
    "Well done.": 1,
    " So Milo has been called back in by his parents, giving us time to be alone and to help him out.": 1,
    "Basically he was the bit that we missed at the start.": 1,
    "His parents had asked him to...": 1,
    " clean up his room, we're going to help him with this now, but this is going to be an introduction and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use.": 1,
    "We're trying to introduce you to what I believe is the most wonderful part, you being able to talk,": 1,
    " in your natural voice to Milo.": 1,
    "Now to do that we needed the setup like a magician's trick.": 1,
    " And what we did was, we needed to give Milo this big proper.": 1,
    "So as Dimitri starts tying up, you can overhear a conversation that Milo's having with his parents.": 1,
    " So he's just built a plate of sausages on the floor and the brand new carpet.": 1,
    "We've all done it as parents, we've all done it as children.": 1,
    " Now's a chance for Dimitri to reassure and calm Milo down.": 1,
    "It's all been too much for him.": 1,
    "He's just moved house, he's got no friends.": 1,
    "Now is the time we reopen that portal and allow you to talk to Milo.": 1,
    " Why don't you try saying something encouraging to cheer Milo up?": 1,
    " Come on Milo, you know what parents are like, they're always getting stressed.": 1,
    " What do they want to come here for anyway?": 1,
    " We don't know anyone.": 1,
    " Well, you've got a new school to go to, you're going to meet loads of cool new friends.": 1,
    " I just really miss my old house, that's all.": 1,
    " Well this is a pretty awesome house Myla, you've got a cool garden to play in and a pond.": 1,
    " It was good skimming stones.": 1,
    " This looks nice.": 1,
    " You cleaned up my room.": 1,
    "Thanks.": 1,
    "So after three quarters of an hour, he's ready, he recognizes you.": 1,
    "And I promise you, if you're sitting in front of this screen, that is a truly wonderful moment.": 1,
    " And we're ready now to tell a story about his child and his life and it goes on and he has, you know, many adventures.": 1,
    "Some of those adventures are a little bit darker on the darker side.": 1,
    "Some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging.": 1,
    "He's going to go to school.": 1,
    " The cool thing is that we're doing as well, as you interact with him you're able to put things into his world, he recognizes objects, his mind is based in the cloud.": 1,
    " That means Milo's mind, as millions of people use it, will get smarter and cleverer.": 1,
    "He'll recognise more objects and understand more words.": 1,
    " But for me, this is a wonderful opportunity where technology at last can be connected with.": 1,
    " where I am no longer restrained by the thing that I hold in my hand as far as a computer game is concerned, or by the blandness of not being noticed if you're watching a film or a book.": 1,
    " And I love those revolutions.": 1,
    "And I love the future that Marla brings.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
