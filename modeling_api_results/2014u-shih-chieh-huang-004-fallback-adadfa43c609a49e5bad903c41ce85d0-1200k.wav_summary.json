    " Thank you.": 2,
    " I was born in Taiwan.": 1,
    "I grew up surrounded by different types of hardware stores.": 1,
    " and I like going to night markets.": 1,
    "I love the energy of the night markets, the colors, the lights, the toys, and all the unexpected things I find every time I go.": 1,
    " Things like watermelon with straw antennas or puppies with mohawks.": 1,
    " When I was growing up, I liked taking toys apart, any kind of toys I find around the house, like my brother's BB gun when he's not home.": 1,
    "I also liked to make": 1,
    " environments for people to explore and play.": 1,
    "In these early installations, I would take plastic sheets, plastic bags, and things I find in the hardware store around the house.": 1,
    " I would take things like highlighter pen, mix it with water, pump it through plastic tubing, creating these glowing circular toy systems for people to walk through and enjoy.": 1,
    " I like these materials because of the way they look, the way they feel, and they're very affordable.": 1,
    "I also like to make devices that work with body parts.": 1,
    " I would take camera, LED lights, and a bunch of cord, and I'd strap it on my waist, and I would videotape my belly button, get a bit of a perspective, and see what it does.": 1,
    " I also like to modify household appliances.": 1,
    "This is an automatic night light.": 1,
    "Some of you might have them at home.": 1,
    "I'll cut out the light sensor, add an extension line, and use modeling clay, stick it onto the television.": 1,
    " And then I will videotape my eye, and using the dark part of my eye, tricking the sensor, thinking it's night time, so you turn on the light bulb.": 1,
    "The white of the eye and the eyelid will trick the sensor, thinking it's daytime.": 1,
    "Anyway, shut off the light.": 1,
    " I wanted to collect more different types of eyes, so I built this device using bicycle helmet, some light bulbs, and television sets.": 1,
    "It would be easier for other people to wear the helmet and record their eyes.": 1,
    " This device allows me to symbolically extract other people's eyes, so I have a diversity of eye to use for my other sculptures.": 1,
    " This sculpture has four eyes, each eye is controlling a different device.": 1,
    "This eye is turning itself around in a television.": 1,
    " This eye is inflating a plastic tube.": 1,
    "This eye is watching a video of another piece being made.": 1,
    "And these two eyes are activating glowing water.": 1,
    " Many of these pieces are later on shown in museums, biennials, triennial exhibitions around the world.": 1,
    " I love science and biology.": 1,
    "In 2007, I was doing a research fellowship at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum looking at bioluminescent organisms in the ocean.": 1,
    " I love these creatures.": 1,
    "I love the way they look, the way they feel.": 1,
    "They're soft.": 1,
    "They're slimy.": 1,
    "And I was fascinated by the way they use light in their environment, either to attract mates for self-defense or attract food.": 1,
    " This research inspired my work in many different ways, things like movement or different light patterns.": 1,
    " So I started gathering a lot of different types of material in my studio and just experimenting and trying this out, trying that out and see what types of creatures I can come up with.": 1,
    "I use a lot of computer cooling fans and just kind of put them together and see what happens.": 1,
    " This is an 8,000 square foot installation composed of many different creatures, some hanging from the ceiling and some resting on the floor.": 1,
    "From afar, they look alien-like, but when you look closer, they're all made out of black garbage bags or Tupperware containers.": 1,
    " I'd like to share with you how ordinary things can become something magical and wondrous.": 1,
    " Yeah.": 1
