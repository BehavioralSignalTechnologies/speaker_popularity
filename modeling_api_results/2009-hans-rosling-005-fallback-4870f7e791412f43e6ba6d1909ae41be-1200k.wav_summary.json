    " AIDS was discovered in 1981, the virus 1983.": 1,
    "These gap-minder bubbles show you how the spread of the virus was 1983 in the world, or how we estimate that it was.": 1,
    " What we are showing here is on this axis here I'm showing percent infected adults.": 1,
    "And on this axis I'm showing dollar per person in income.": 1,
    " And the size of these bubbles, the size of the bubbles here, that shows how many are infected in each country, and the color is the continent.": 1,
    " Now you can see United States 1983 had a very low percentage infected, but due to the big population, still a sizable bubble.": 1,
    "There were quite many people infected in the United States.": 1,
    " And up there you see Uganda.": 1,
    "They had almost 5% infected and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country then.": 1,
    "And they were probably the most infected country in the world.": 1,
    "Now, what has happened?": 1,
    " Now you have understood the graph and now in the next 60 seconds we will play the HIV epidemic in the world.": 1,
    "But first I have a new invention here.": 1,
    " I...": 1,
    " I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer.": 1,
    " So, ready, steady, go.": 1,
    "First, we had a fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe.": 1,
    "They went upwards like this.": 1,
    " In Asia, the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand.": 1,
    "They reached one to two percent.": 1,
    "And then Uganda started to turn back, where Zimbabwe skyrocketed.": 1,
    " And some years later, South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency.": 1,
    "Look, India got many infected, but had a low level, you know, and almost the same happens here.": 1,
    " See, Uganda coming down, Zimbabwe coming down, Russia went to 1%.": 1,
    "In the last two to three years, we have reached the steady state of the HIV epidemic in the world.": 1,
    " 25 years it took, but steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better.": 1,
    "It's just that they have stopped getting worse.": 1,
    " And the steady state is more or less 1% of the adult world population is HIV infected.": 1,
    "It means 30 to 40 million people, the whole of California, every person.": 1,
    "That's more or less what we have today in the world.": 1,
    " Now, let me make a fast replay of Botswana.": 1,
    "Botswana, upper middle income country in southern Africa, democratic government,": 1,
    " good economy and this is what happened there.": 1,
    "They started low, they skyrocketed, they peaked up there in 2003 and now they are down.": 1,
    "But they are falling only slowly because in Botswana with good economy and governance,": 1,
    " They can manage to treat people.": 1,
    "And if people are infected or treated, they don't die in AIDS.": 1,
    "And these percentages won't come down because people can survive in 10 to 20 years.": 1,
    "So there's some problem with these metrics now.": 1,
    " But the poorer countries in Africa, the low-income countries down here, they're...": 1,
    " the rates fall faster of the percentage infected because people still die in spite of PEPFAR, the generous PEPFAR.": 1,
    " All people are not reached by treatment, and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries, only 60% are left on treatment after two years.": 1,
    " It's not realistic with life year long treatment for everyone in the poorest country, but it's very good that what is done is being done.": 1,
    "But focus now is back on prevention.": 1,
    " That's only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it.": 1,
    "Drugs is too costly.": 1,
    "Had we had the vaccine or when we will get the vaccine, that's something more effective.": 1,
    " but the drugs are very costly for the poor, not the drug in itself, but the treatment and the care which is needed around it.": 1,
    " When we look at the pattern, one thing comes out very clearly.": 1,
    "You see the blue bubbles and people say HIV is very high in Africa.": 1,
    "I would say HIV is very different in Africa.": 1,
    " You have the highest HIV rates in the world, you find in African countries, and yet you find Senegal down here at the same rate as the United States.": 1,
    " and you find Madagascar and you find a lot of African countries about as low as the rest of the world.": 1,
    "It's this terrible simplification that there is one Africa and things go on in one way in Africa.": 1,
    "We have to stop": 1,
    " It's not respectful and it's not very clever to think that way.": 1,
    " I had the fortune to live and work for a time in the United States.": 1,
    "I found out that Salt Lake City and San Francisco were different.": 1,
    " And so it is in Africa.": 1,
    "It's a lot of difference.": 1,
    "So why is it so high?": 1,
    "Is it war?": 1,
    "No, it's not.": 1,
    "Look here, war-torn Congo is down there, two, three, four percent.": 1,
    " And this is peaceful Zambia, neighbouring country, 15%.": 1,
    "And there's good studies of the refugees coming out of Congo.": 1,
    "They have 2-3% infected and peaceful Zambia much higher.": 1,
    " There's now a study clearly showing that the wars are terrible, that rapes are terrible.": 1,
    "This is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa.": 1,
    "So is it poverty?": 1,
    " Well, if you look at the macro level, it seems more money, more HIV.": 1,
    " But that's very simplistic.": 1,
    "So let's go down and look at Tanzania.": 1,
    "I will split Tanzania in five income groups, from the highest income to the lowest income.": 1,
    "And here we go.": 1,
    " The ones with the highest income, the better off, I wouldn't say rich, they have higher HIV.": 1,
    "The difference goes from 11% down to 4%.": 1,
    "And it's even bigger among women.": 1,
    " There's a lot of things that we thought that now good research done by African institutions and researchers together with the international show that that's not the case.": 1,
    " So this is the difference within Tanzania.": 1,
    "And I can't avoid showing Kenya.": 1,
    "Look here, Kenya.": 1,
    "I will split Kenya in its provinces.": 1,
    "Here it goes.": 1,
    " See the difference within one African country.": 1,
    "It goes from very low level to very high level and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest.": 1,
    " So what is it then?": 1,
    "Why do we see this extremely high in some countries?": 1,
    "Well, it is more common with multiple partners.": 1,
    "There is less condom use.": 1,
    " And there is age-dispersed sex.": 1,
    "That is, older men tend to have sex with younger women.": 1,
    "We see higher rates in younger women than younger men in many of these highly affected countries.": 1,
    "But where are they situated?": 1,
    "I will swap the bubbles to a map.": 1,
    " Look, the highly infected are 4% of world population and they hold 50% of HIV infected.": 1,
    " HIV exists all over the world.": 1,
    "Look, you have bubbles all over the world here.": 1,
    "Brazil has been HIV infected.": 1,
    "Arab countries not so much, but Iran is quite high.": 1,
    "They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran.": 1,
    " India is many because there are many, Southeast Asia and so on.": 1,
    "But there is one part of Africa and the difficult thing is at the same time": 1,
    " not to make a uniform statement about Africa, not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this on one hand.": 1,
    "On the other hand, try to say that this is not the case.": 1,
    " because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now and UNAIDS have done good data available finally about the spread of HIV.": 1,
    " It could be concurrency.": 1,
    " It could be some virus types, it could be that there is other things which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency.": 1,
    "After all, if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex, the risk of infection in one intercourse": 1,
    " is one in thousand.": 1,
    "Don't jump to conclusions on how to behave tonight and so on.": 1,
    " And if you are in an unfavorable situation, more sexually transmitted diseases, it can be one in a hundred.": 1,
    "But what we think is that it could be concurrency.": 1,
    "And what is concurrency?": 1,
    "In Sweden.": 1,
    " We have no concurrency.": 1,
    "We have serial monogamy.": 1,
    "Vodka New Year's Eve, new partner for the spring.": 1,
    "Vodka Midsummer Eve, new partner for the fall.": 1,
    "Vodka, and it goes on like this, you know, and you collect a big number of X. And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic.": 1,
    " Terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years.": 1,
    "HIV has a peak after three to six weeks and therefore having more than one partner in the same month is much more dangerous for HIV than others.": 1,
    " Probably this is a combination of this.": 1,
    "And what makes me so happy is that we are moving now towards fact when we look at this.": 1,
    " You can get this chart free.": 1,
    "We have uploaded UNH's data on Gapminder's site.": 1,
    "And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future, we will not only have the heart, we will not only have the money.": 1,
    " but we will also use the brain.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
