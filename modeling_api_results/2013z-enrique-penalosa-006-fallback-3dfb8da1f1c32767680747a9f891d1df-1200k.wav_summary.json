    " Mobility in developing world cities is a very peculiar challenge, because different from health or education or housing,": 1,
    " It tends to get worse as societies become richer, clearly a non-sustainable model.": 1,
    "Mobility, as most other developing country problems,": 1,
    " More than a matter of money or technology, it's a matter of equality, equity.": 1,
    " The great inequality in developing countries makes it difficult to see, for example, that in terms of transport, an advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars.": 1,
    " but rather one where even the rich use public transport.": 1,
    " Or bicycles.": 1,
    "For example, in Amsterdam more than 30% of the population uses bicycles despite the fact that the Netherlands has a higher income per capita than the United States.": 1,
    " There is a conflict in developing world cities for money, for government investment.": 1,
    "If more money is invested in highways, of course there is less money for housing, for schools, for hospitals.": 1,
    " And also, there is a conflict for space.": 1,
    "There is a conflict for space between those with cars and those without them.": 1,
    " Most of us accept today that private property and market economy is the best way to manage most of society's resources.": 1,
    "However, there is a problem with that.": 1,
    "That market economy needs": 1,
    " Inequality of income in order to work.": 1,
    "Some people must make more money, some others less.": 1,
    "Some companies succeed, others fail.": 1,
    "Then what kind of equality can we hope for today with market economy?": 1,
    " I would propose two kinds which both have much to do with cities.": 1,
    "The first one is equality of quality of life, especially for children.": 1,
    " that all children should have beyond the obvious health and education, access to green spaces, to sports facilities,": 1,
    " to swimming pools, to music lessons.": 1,
    "And the second kind of equality is one which we could call democratic equality.": 1,
    " The first article in every constitution states that all citizens are equal before the law.": 1,
    "That is not just poetry.": 1,
    "It's a very powerful principle.": 1,
    "For example, if that is true,": 1,
    " A bus with 80 passengers has a right to 80 times more road space than a car with one.": 1,
    " We have been so used to inequality sometimes that it's before our noses and we do not see it.": 1,
    " Less than 100 years ago, women could not vote, and it seemed normal, in the same way that it seems normal today to see a bus in traffic.": 1,
    "In fact, when I became mayor,": 1,
    " Applying that democratic principle that public good prevails over private interests, that a bus with a hundred people has a right to a hundred times more road space than a car, we implemented a mass transit system.": 1,
    " based on bosses on exclusive lanes.": 1,
    "We call it Transmilenio in order to make bosses sexier.": 1,
    " One thing is that it's also a very beautiful democratic symbol because as buses zoom by, expensive cars stalk in traffic.": 1,
    " It clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work.": 1,
    " In fact, it's not just a matter of equity.": 1,
    " It doesn't take PhDs.": 1,
    "A committee of 12-year-old children would find out in 20 minutes that the most efficient way to use scarce road space is with exclusive lanes for buses.": 1,
    " In fact, buses are not sexy, but they are the only possible means to bring mass transit to all areas of fast-growing developing cities.": 1,
    " They also have great capacity.": 1,
    "For example, this system in Guangzhou is moving more passengers our direction than all subway lines in China, except for one line in Beijing at a fraction of the cost.": 1,
    " We fought not just for space for buses, but we fought for space for people, and that was even more difficult.": 1,
    " Cities are human habitats, and we humans are pedestrians.": 1,
    "Just as fish need to swim or birds need to fly or deer need to run, we need to walk.": 1,
    "There is a really": 1,
    " enormous conflict when we are talking in developing country cities between pedestrians and cars.": 1,
    "Here what you see is a picture that shows": 1,
    " insufficient democracy.": 1,
    "What this shows is that people who walk are third class citizens while those who go in cars are first class citizens.": 1,
    " In terms of transport infrastructure, what really makes a difference between advanced and backward cities is not highways or subways.": 1,
    " but quality sidewalks.": 1,
    "Here they made a flyover, probably very useless, and they forgot to make a sidewalk.": 1,
    " This is prevailing all over the world.": 1,
    "Not even school children are more important than cars.": 1,
    " In my city of Bogota, we fought a very difficult battle in order to take space from cars which had been parking on sidewalks for decades.": 1,
    " in order to make space for people that should reflect dignity of human beings and to make space for protected bikeways.": 1,
    "First of all, I have a black hair before that.": 1,
    " and I was almost impeached in the process.": 1,
    "It is a very difficult battle.": 1,
    "However, it was possible, finally, after very difficult battles, to make a city that would reflect": 1,
    " some respect for human dignity that would show that those who walked are equally important to those who have cars.": 1,
    "Indeed, a very important ideological and political issue anywhere is how to distribute that most valuable resource of a city.": 1,
    " which is road space.": 1,
    "A city could find oil or diamonds underground, and it would not be so valuable as road space.": 1,
    "How to distribute it between pedestrians, bicycles, public transport, and cars?": 1,
    " This is not a technological issue.": 1,
    "And we should remember that in no constitution, parking is a constitutional right when we make that distribution.": 1,
    " We also built, and this was 15 years ago before there were bikeways in New York or in Paris or in London, it was a very difficult battle as well, more than 350 kilometers of protected bicycle ways.": 1,
    " I don't think protected bicycle ways are a cute architectural feature.": 1,
    "They are a right, just as sidewalks are, unless we believe that only those with access to a motor vehicle": 1,
    " have a right to safe mobility without the risk of getting killed.": 1,
    "And just as both ways are,": 1,
    " Protected bikeways also are a powerful symbol of democracy because they show that a citizen on a $30 bicycle is equally important to one on a $30,000 car.": 1,
    " And we are living in a unique moment in history.": 1,
    "In the next 50 years, more than half of those cities which will exist in the year 2060 will be built.": 1,
    " In many developing country cities, more than 80% and 90% of the city which will exist in the year 2060 will be built over the next four or five decades.": 1,
    "But this is not just a matter for developing country cities.": 1,
    " In the United States, for example, more than 70 million new homes must be built over the next 40 or 50 years.": 1,
    "That's more than all the homes that today exist in Britain, France, and Canada put together.": 1,
    " And I believe that our cities today have severe flaws and that different, better ones could be built.": 1,
    "What is wrong with our cities today?": 1,
    " For example, if we tell any three-year-old child who is barely learning to speak in any city in the world today, watch out, a car, the child will jump in fright.": 1,
    " And with a very good reason, because there are more than 10,000 children who are killed by cars every year in the world.": 1,
    " We have had cities for 8,000 years, and children could walk out of home and play.": 1,
    "In fact, only very recently, towards 1900, there were no cars.": 1,
    "Cars have been here for really less than 100 years.": 1,
    " they completely changed cities.": 1,
    "In 1900, for example, nobody was killed by cars in the United States.": 1,
    "Only 20 years later, between 1920 and 1930,": 1,
    " Almost 200,000 people were killed by cars in the United States.": 1,
    "Only in 1925, almost 7,000 children were killed by cars in the United States.": 1,
    " So we could make different cities.": 1,
    "Cities that would give more priority to human beings than to cars, that would give more public space to human beings than to cars.": 1,
    " Cities that would show great respect for those most vulnerable citizens such as children or the elderly.": 1,
    "I will propose to you a couple of ingredients which I think would make cities": 1,
    " much better and it would be very simple to implement them in the new cities which are only being created.": 1,
    "Hundreds of kilometers of greenways, crisscrossing cities in all directions,": 1,
    " Children would walk out of home into safe spaces.": 1,
    "They could go for dozens of kilometers safely without any risk in wonderful greenways, sort of bicycle highways.": 1,
    "And I will invite you to imagine the following.": 1,
    " a city in which every other street would be a street only for pedestrians and bicycles.": 1,
    " In new cities, which are going to be built, this would not be particularly difficult.": 1,
    "When I was mayor of Bogota, in only three years, we were able to create 70 kilometers.": 1,
    " in one of the most dense cities in the world of these bicycle highways.": 1,
    " And this changes the way people live, move, enjoy the city.": 1,
    "In this picture you see in one of very poor neighborhoods, we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street and the cars still in the mud.": 1,
    " Of course, I would love to pave this street for cars, but what do we do first?": 1,
    "99% of people in those neighborhoods don't have cars.": 1,
    "But you see, when a city is only being created, it's very easy to incorporate this kind of infrastructure.": 1,
    " then the city grows around it.": 1,
    "And of course, this is just a glimpse of something which could be much better if we just create it and it changes the way of life.": 1,
    "And the second ingredient": 1,
    " which would solve mobility, that very difficult challenge in developing countries in a very low cost and simple way would be to have": 1,
    " Hundreds of kilometers of streets only for buses.": 1,
    "Buses and bicycles and pedestrians.": 1,
    "This would be again a very low cost solution if implemented from the start.": 1,
    " low-cost pleasant transit with natural sunlight?": 1,
    "Well, but unfortunately, reality is not as good as my dreams.": 1,
    " Because of private property of land and high land prices,": 1,
    " All developing country cities have a large problem of slums.": 1,
    "In my country of Colombia, almost half the homes in cities initially were illegal developments.": 1,
    " And of course, it's very difficult to have mass transit or to use bicycles in such environments.": 1,
    "But even legal developments": 1,
    " are also being located in the wrong places, very far from the city centers where it's impossible to provide low-cost, high-frequency public transport.": 1,
    " As a Latin American, and Latin America was the most recently urbanized region in the world, I would recommend respectfully, passionately,": 1,
    " to those countries which are yet to urbanize.": 1,
    "Latin America went from 40% urban in 1950 to 80% urban in 2010.": 1,
    " I would recommend Asian and African countries, which are yet to urbanize, such as India, which is only 33% urban now.": 1,
    " that governments should acquire all land around cities.": 1,
    "In this way, their cities could grow in the right places, with the right spaces, with parks, with the greenways, with the busways.": 1,
    " The cities we're going to build over the next 50 years will determine quality of life and even happiness for billions of people towards the future.": 1,
    "What a fantastic opportunity for leaders.": 1,
    " and many young leaders to come, especially in the developing countries.": 1,
    "They can create a much happier life for billions towards the future.": 1,
    "I am sure, I am optimist, that they will make cities better than our most ambitious dreams.": 1
