    " I'm a writer and a journalist, and I'm also an insanely curious person.": 1,
    "So in 22 years as a journalist, I learned how to do a lot of new things.": 1,
    "And three years ago, one of the things I learned to do was to become invisible.": 1,
    " I became one of the working homeless.": 1,
    " I quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in February of that same year and decided to travel.": 1,
    " His death hit me pretty hard and there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that.": 1,
    " I've camped my whole life and I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip.": 1,
    "So I packed my cat, my Rottweiler, and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van and I drove off into the sunset.": 1,
    " having fully failed to realize three critical things.": 1,
    "One, that society equates living in a permanent structure, even a shack, with having value as a person.": 1,
    " Two, I failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality if we let it.": 1,
    "And three, I failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude, not a lifestyle.": 1,
    " At first, living in the van was great.": 1,
    "I showered in campgrounds, I ate out regularly, and I had time to relax and to grieve.": 1,
    "But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.": 1,
    " My freelance job ended and I had to get a full-time job to pay the bills.": 1,
    "What had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer, and it became impossible to park anywhere.": 1,
    " without it being very obvious that I had a cat and a dog with me and it was really hot.": 1,
    "The cat came and went through an open window in the van, the doggie went into doggie daycare, and I sweated.": 1,
    " Whenever I could, I used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops, or I washed up in public restrooms.": 1,
    " Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely drop below 80 degrees Fahrenheit, making it difficult or impossible to sleep.": 1,
    " Food rotted in the heat.": 1,
    "Ice in my ice chest melted within hours, and it was pretty miserable.": 1,
    " I couldn't afford to find an apartment, or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the Rottweiler and the cat, and I refused to give them up.": 1,
    "So I stayed in the van.": 1,
    " And when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom outside my van at night, I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet.": 1,
    " When winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped below freezing and they stayed there and I faced a whole new set of challenges.": 1,
    " I parked a different place every night so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police.": 1,
    "I didn't always succeed.": 1,
    " I felt out of control of my life, and I don't know when or how it happened, but the speed at which I went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman living in a van": 1,
    " Took my breath away.": 1,
    "I hadn't changed.": 1,
    "My IQ hadn't dropped.": 1,
    "My talent.": 1,
    " My integrity, my values, everything about me remained the same, but I had changed somehow.": 1,
    " I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression, and eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic.": 1,
    "And I went.": 1,
    "I hadn't bathed in three days.": 1,
    "I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line.": 1,
    "I just wasn't drunk or high.": 1,
    " And when several of the homeless men realized that...": 1,
    " including a former university professor, they said, you aren't homeless, why are you really here?": 1,
    "Other homeless people didn't see me as homeless, but I did.": 1,
    " Then the professor listened to my story and he said,": 1,
    " You have a job.": 1,
    " You have hope.": 1,
    "The real homeless don't have hope.": 1,
    " A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal, and I remember thinking, if I killed myself, no one would notice.": 1,
    " A friend.": 1,
    " A friend told me shortly after that that she had heard that Tim Russert, a nationally renowned journalist, had been talking about me on national TV.": 1,
    "An essay I'd written about my father the year before he died.": 1,
    " was in Tim's new book, and he was doing the talk show circuit, and he was talking about my writing.": 1,
    "And when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of Meet the Press, was talking about my writing while I was living in a van in a Walmart parking lot,": 1,
    " I started laughing.": 1,
    "You should too.": 1,
    "I started laughing because it got to the point where was I a writer or was I a homeless woman?": 1,
    "So I went in the bookstore and I found Tim's book.": 1,
    " And I stood there and I reread my essay and I cried because I was a writer.": 1,
    "I was a writer.": 1,
    " Shortly after that, I moved back to Tennessee.": 1,
    "I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends, and I started writing again.": 1,
    " By the summer of the following year, I was a working journalist, I was winning awards, I was living in my own apartment, I was no longer homeless, and I was no longer invisible.": 1,
    " Thousands of people work full and part-time jobs and live in their cars.": 1,
    "But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets.": 1,
    " So the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible.": 1,
    "But if you ever meet one, engage them, encourage them, and offer them hope.": 1,
    " The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope.": 1,
    " And I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless.": 1,
    "I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandling your meat.": 1,
    "But I am here to tell you that based on my experience, people are not where they live, where they sleep.": 1,
    " or what their life situation is at any given time.": 1,
    " Three years ago, I was living in a van in a Walmart parking lot.": 1,
    "And today, I'm speaking at TED.": 1,
    "Hope always, always finds a way.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
