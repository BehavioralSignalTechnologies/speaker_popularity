    " Thank you.": 2,
    " We're going to talk about a new lecture just for Ted.": 1,
    "And I'm going to show you some illusions that we've created for Ted.": 1,
    "And I'm going to try and relate this to happiness.": 1,
    " And what I was thinking about with happiness is what gives happiness or happiness which I equate with joy in my particular area.": 1,
    "And I think there's something very fundamental.": 1,
    "And I was thinking about this.": 1,
    " and it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows, is that": 1,
    " There's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way.": 1,
    "You go see a movie.": 1,
    " And it has an unexpected twist, something that you didn't expect, and you find a joyful experience.": 1,
    "You look at the sort of illusions in my book.": 1,
    " And it's not as what you'd expect, and there's something joyful about it.": 1,
    "And it's the same thing with jokes and all these sort of things.": 1,
    "So what I'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if I can": 1,
    " violate your expectations in a pleasing way.": 1,
    "I mean, sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way, so I can make the audience here happy.": 1,
    " So I'm going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations.": 1,
    "First of all, I want to show you a particular illusion here.": 1,
    "I want you, first of all, when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other.": 1,
    " These are all perceptual tricks.": 1,
    "These are real objects that I'm going to show you.": 1,
    " Now I'm going to show you how it was done.": 1,
    "I've looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience.": 1,
    "I want you to see.": 1,
    " how this illusion's constructed, and it's going to rotate.": 1,
    "So you see that it's an inside-out thing.": 1,
    "Now watch as it rotates back how quickly your perception snaps.": 1,
    " OK, now watch it as it rotates back again.": 1,
    "And this is a very bright audience, all right?": 1,
    "See if you can stop it from happening, even though you know 100% it's truth.": 1,
    "Bang.": 1,
    "You can't undo it.": 1,
    " What does that tell you about yourselves?": 1,
    "We're going to do it again.": 1,
    "No doubt about it.": 1,
    "See if you can stop it from happening.": 1,
    "No.": 1,
    "It's difficult.": 1,
    " And we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation, about shape, about color, and so forth.": 1,
    "And it's very primal.": 1,
    "And it's an interesting question to ponder why these things": 1,
    " We find these things joyful.": 1,
    "Why would we find that joyful?": 1,
    "So here's something that Lionel did a while ago.": 1,
    "I like these sort of little things like this.": 1,
    " Again, this is not an optical trick.": 1,
    "This is what you would see.": 1,
    " In other words, it's not a camera cut.": 1,
    "It's a perceptual trick.": 1,
    " Okay, we can violate your expectations about shape.": 1,
    " We can violate your expectations on representation.": 1,
    "What an image represents.": 1,
    "What do you see here?": 1,
    " How many of you here see dolphins?": 1,
    " Raise your hand if you see dolphins.": 1,
    "Those people who have raised their hands afterwards, the rest of the audience, go talk to them.": 1,
    "All right?": 1,
    " Actually, this is the best example of priming by experience that I know.": 1,
    "If you are a child under the age of 10 who haven't been ruined yet,": 1,
    " You will look at this image and see dolphins.": 1,
    "Now, some of you adults here are saying, what dolphins?": 1,
    "What dolphins?": 1,
    "But in fact, if you reverse the figure ground, in other words, the dark areas here, I forgot to ask for a pointer.": 1,
    " But if you reverse, you'll see a whole series of little dolphins.": 1,
    "By the way, if you're also a student at Caltech, they tend also to just see the dolphins.": 1,
    "It is based on experience.": 1,
    " Now, something like this can be used, because this is, after all, a talk about design, too.": 1,
    "This was done by Saatchi and Saatchi.": 1,
    "And they actually got away with this ad in Australia.": 1,
    "So if you look at this ad.": 1,
    " for a beer, all those people are in sort of provocative positions, but they got it passed and actually won the Clio Awards.": 1,
    "So it's funny how you can do these things.": 1,
    "Remember that sort of...": 1,
    " This is a joke I did when the Florida ballot was going around.": 1,
    "Count the dots for Gore.": 1,
    "Count the dots for Bush.": 1,
    "Count them again.": 1,
    " You can violate your expectations about experience.": 1,
    " an outside water fountain that I created with some friends of mine.": 1,
    "But you can stop the water and drops, and then actually make all the drops levitate.": 1,
    " So this is something that we're building for amusement parks and that kind of stuff.": 1,
    "Now let's take a static image.": 1,
    "Can you see this?": 1,
    "Do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up?": 1,
    "It's completely static.": 1,
    " It's a static image.": 1,
    "How many people see this illusion?": 1,
    " but it's completely static.": 1,
    " All right, now it's interesting that when we look at an image, we see color, depth, texture.": 1,
    " And you can look at this whole scene and analyze it.": 1,
    "You can see the woman is closer than the wall and so forth.": 1,
    "But the whole thing is actually flat.": 1,
    " It's painted.": 1,
    "It's Trump Law.": 1,
    "And it was such a good Trump Law that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman, and she wouldn't respond.": 1,
    " Now, you can make design mistakes, like this building in New York, so that when you": 1,
    " see it from this side, it looks like the balconies tilt up.": 1,
    "And when you walk around to the other side, it looks like the balconies": 1,
    " go down.": 1,
    "So there are cases where you have mistakes in design that incorporate illusions.": 1,
    "Or you take this particular unretouched photograph.": 1,
    " Now, interestingly enough, I get a lot of emails from people who say, is there any perceptual difference between males and females?": 1,
    " And I really say, no, I mean, women can navigate through the world just as well as males can.": 1,
    "And why wouldn't they?": 1,
    "However, this is the one illusion that women can consistently do better than males in matching which head.": 1,
    " because they rely on fashion cues.": 1,
    "They can match the hat.": 1,
    " Now, getting to a part, I want to show design in illusions.": 1,
    "I believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by Da Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye.": 1,
    " so that when you saw from one little angle was like this.": 1,
    "And this little technique got popular in the 16th century, the 17th century, to disguise hidden meanings where you could flip the image and see it from one little": 1,
    " point of view like this.": 1,
    "So these are early incorporations of illusions brought to its sort of hot point with Hans Holbein's ambassadors.": 1,
    "Hans Holbein worked for Henry VIII.": 1,
    " This was hung on a wall where you walked down from a stair and you could see this hidden skull.": 1,
    " All right, now I'm going to show you some designers who work with illusions to give that element of surprise.": 1,
    "One of my favorite is Scott Kim.": 1,
    "I worked with Scott to create some illusions for Ted.": 1,
    " that I hope you will enjoy.": 1,
    "We have one here on Ted and happiness.": 1,
    " OK, now Arthur hasn't talked yet, but his is going to be a delightful talk.": 1,
    "And he has some of his really fantastic machines outside.": 1,
    "And so Scott created this wonderful.": 1,
    " tribute to Arthur Ganson.": 1,
    " Well there's analog and digital.": 1,
    " I thought that was appropriate here.": 1,
    " and figure goes to ground.": 1,
    " and for the musicians.": 1,
    " And of course, since happiness, we want joy to the world.": 1,
    " Now, another great designer, he's very well known in Japan, Shigeo Fukuda.": 1,
    "And he just builds some fantastic things.": 1,
    "This is simply amazing.": 1,
    " This is a pile of junk.": 1,
    " that when you view it from one particular angle,": 1,
    " you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano.": 1,
    " Pianist.": 1,
    " transforms to a violinist.": 1,
    " This is really wild.": 1,
    " This is an assemblage of forks, knives, and spoons and various cutlery welded together.": 1,
    " and get a shadow of a motorcycle.": 1,
    " You learn something in the sort of thing that I do, which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands.": 1,
    " Ken Knowlton does wonderful composite images.": 1,
    " Like creating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells.": 1,
    "Unretouched seashells, but just by rearranging them.": 1,
    "He did Einstein out of dice.": 1,
    " Because after all, Einstein said, God does not play dice with the universe.": 1,
    "Bert Herzog, out of unretouched keyboards.": 1,
    "Will Shortz, crossword puzzle.": 1,
    " John Cederquist does these wonderful Trump-Loi.": 1,
    " cabins.": 1,
    "Now I'm going to skip ahead because I'm sort of running ahead.": 1,
    "I want to show you quickly what I've created.": 1,
    " some new type of illusions.": 1,
    "I've done something with taking the Pixar type illusions.": 1,
    "So you see these kids the same size here.": 1,
    " running down the hall.": 1,
    "The two table tops are the same size.": 1,
    "They're looking out two directions at once.": 1,
    "You have a larger piece fitting in within smaller.": 1,
    " And that's something for you to think about.": 1,
    "All right.": 1,
    "So you see larger pieces fitting in within smaller pieces here.": 1,
    "Does everyone see that?": 1,
    "Which is impossible.": 1,
    " You can see the two kids are looking out simultaneously out of two different directions at once.": 1,
    " Now can you believe these two table tops are the same size and shape?": 1,
    "They are.": 1,
    "So if you measured them, they would be.": 1,
    " And as I say, those two figures are identical in size and shape.": 1,
    " All right.": 1,
    "And it's interesting by doing these.": 1,
    " this in this sort of rendered fashion how much stronger the illusions are.": 1,
    "In any case, I hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness.": 1,
    "And if you're interested in seeing more cool effects, see me outside.": 1,
    "I'd be happy to show you lots of things.": 1,
    "That was great.": 1
