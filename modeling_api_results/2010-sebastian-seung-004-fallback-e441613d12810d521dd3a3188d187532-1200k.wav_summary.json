    " We live in a remarkable time, the age of genomics.": 1,
    " Your genome is the entire sequence of your DNA.": 1,
    "Your sequence and mine are slightly different.": 1,
    " That's why we look different.": 1,
    "I've got brown eyes.": 1,
    "You might have blue or gray.": 1,
    "But it's not just skin deep.": 1,
    "The headlines tell us that genes can give us scary diseases.": 1,
    " maybe even shape our personality or give us mental disorders.": 1,
    " Our genes seem to have awesome power over our destinies.": 1,
    " And yes.": 1,
    " I would like to think that I am more than my genes.": 1,
    " What do you guys think?": 1,
    "Are you more than your genes?": 1,
    "Yes.": 1,
    " I think some people agree with me.": 1,
    "I think we should make a statement.": 1,
    "I think we should say it all together.": 1,
    " All right, I am more than my jeans altogether.": 1,
    "I am more than my jeans.": 1,
    " What am I?": 1,
    " I am my connecto.": 1,
    " And since you guys are really great, maybe you could humor me and say this all together too?": 1,
    " Right?": 1,
    "All together now.": 1,
    "I am my connecto.": 1,
    " That sounded great.": 1,
    "You know, you guys are so great.": 1,
    "You don't even know what a connectome is and you're willing to play along with me.": 1,
    "I could just go home now.": 1,
    " Well, so far, only one connectome is known, that of this tiny worm.": 1,
    "Its modest nervous system consists of just 300 neurons.": 1,
    " And in the 1970s and 80s, a team of scientists mapped all 7,000 connections between the neurons.": 1,
    " In this diagram, every node is a neuron and every line is a connection.": 1,
    "This is the connectome of the worm sea elegance.": 1,
    " Your connectome is far more complex than this because your brain contains 100 billion neurons and 10,000 times as many connections.": 1,
    " There's a diagram like this for your brain, but there's no way it would fit on this slide.": 1,
    " Your connectome contains one million times more connections than your genome has letters.": 1,
    "That's a lot of information.": 1,
    " What's in that information?": 1,
    " We don't know for sure, but there are theories.": 1,
    "Since the 19th century, neuroscientists have speculated that maybe your memories, the information that makes you you, maybe your memories are stored in the connections between your brain's neurons.": 1,
    " And perhaps other aspects of your personal identity, maybe your personality and your intellect, maybe they're also encoded in the connections between your neurons.": 1,
    " And so now you can see why I proposed this hypothesis.": 1,
    "I am my connectome.": 1,
    " I didn't ask you to chant it because it's true.": 1,
    "I just want you to remember it.": 1,
    "And in fact, we don't know if this hypothesis is correct because we have never had technologies powerful enough to test it.": 1,
    " Fighting that worm connectome took over a dozen years of tedious labor.": 1,
    "And to find the connectomes of brains more like our own, we need more sophisticated technologies that are automated, that will speed up the process of finding connectomes.": 1,
    " And in the next few minutes, I'll tell you about some of these technologies which are currently under development in my lab and the labs of my collaborators.": 1,
    " Now, you've probably seen pictures of neurons before.": 1,
    "You can recognize them instantly by their fantastic shapes.": 1,
    "They extend long and delicate branches, and in short, they look like trees.": 1,
    " But this is just a single neuron.": 1,
    "In order to find connectomes, we have to see all the neurons at the same time.": 1,
    " So let's meet Bobby Castore, who works in the laboratory of Jeff Lichtman at Harvard University.": 1,
    "Bobby is holding fantastically thin slices of a mouse brain, and we're zooming in by a factor of 100,000 times.": 1,
    " to obtain the resolution so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time.": 1,
    " except you still may not really recognize them, and that's because we have to work in three dimensions.": 1,
    "If we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up, we get a three-dimensional image.": 1,
    " And still you may not see the branches, so we start at the top, and we color in the cross-section of one branch in red.": 1,
    "And we do that for the next slice, and for the next slice.": 1,
    "And we keep on doing that, slice after slice.": 1,
    " If we continue through the entire stack, we can reconstruct the three-dimensional shape of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron.": 1,
    "And we can do that for another neuron in green.": 1,
    "And you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron at two locations.": 1,
    " These are what are called synapses.": 1,
    " Let's zoom in on one synapse and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron.": 1,
    "You should see small circles.": 1,
    "These are called vesicles.": 1,
    "They contain a molecule known as a neurotransmitter.": 1,
    " And so when the green neuron wants to communicate, wants to send a message to the red neuron, it spits out neurotransmitter.": 1,
    "At the synapse, the two neurons are said to be connected, like two friends talking on the telephone.": 1,
    " So you've seen how to find a synapse.": 1,
    "How can we find an entire connectome?": 1,
    " Well, we take this three-dimensional stack of images and treat it as a gigantic three-dimensional coloring book.": 1,
    "We color every neuron in in a different color.": 1,
    " And then we look through all of the images, find the synapses, and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse.": 1,
    "If we can do that throughout all the images, we could find a connectome.": 1,
    " Now, at this point, you've learned the basics of neurons and synapses, and so I think we're ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience.": 1,
    " How are the brains of men and women different?": 1,
    " According to this self-help book, guys' brains are like waffles.": 1,
    "They keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes.": 1,
    " Girls' brains are like spaghetti.": 1,
    "Everything in their life is connected to everything else.": 1,
    " You guys are laughing, but you know, this book changed my life!": 1,
    " But seriously, what's wrong with this?": 1,
    "You already know enough to tell me what's wrong with this statement.": 1,
    " It doesn't matter whether you're a guy or girl, everyone's brains are like spaghetti.": 1,
    " or maybe really, really fine capellini with branches.": 1,
    " Just as one strand of spaghetti contacts many other strands on your plate, one neuron touches many other neurons through their entangled branches.": 1,
    "One neuron can be connected to so many other neurons because there can be synapses at these points of contact.": 1,
    " By now, you might have sort of lost perspective on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is.": 1,
    "And so let's do a series of comparisons to show you.": 1,
    "I'll assure you, this is very tiny.": 1,
    "It's just six microns on a side.": 1,
    " So here's how it stacks up against an entire neuron.": 1,
    "And you can tell that really only the smallest fragments of branches are contained inside this cube.": 1,
    " And a neuron, well, that's smaller than brain.": 1,
    " and that's just a mouth spray.": 1,
    " It's a lot smaller than a human brain.": 1,
    " So when I show my friends this, sometimes they've told me, you know, Sebastian, you should just give up.": 1,
    " Neuroscience is hopeless.": 1,
    " Because if you look at a brain with your naked eye, you don't really see how complex it is, but when you use a microscope, finally the hidden complexity is revealed.": 1,
    " In the 17th century, the mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal wrote of his dread of the infinite.": 1,
    " his feeling of insignificance at contemplating the vast reaches of outer space.": 1,
    " And as a scientist, I'm not supposed to talk about my feelings.": 1,
    "Too much information, Professor.": 1,
    " But may I?": 1,
    " I feel curiosity.": 1,
    " And I feel wonder, but at times I have also felt despair.": 1,
    " Why did I choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite?": 1,
    " It's absurd.": 1,
    "How could we even dare to think that we might ever understand this?": 1,
    " And yet, I persist in this quixotic endeavor, and indeed, these days I harbor new hopes.": 1,
    " Someday, a fleet of microscopes will capture every neuron and every synapse in a vast database of images.": 1,
    " And someday, artificially intelligent supercomputers will analyze the images without human assistance to summarize them in a connectome.": 1,
    " I do not know, but I hope that I will live to see that day.": 1,
    " Because finding an entire human connectome is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time.": 1,
    "It will take the work of generations to succeed.": 1,
    " At the present time, my collaborators and I, what we're aiming for is much more modest, just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain.": 1,
    "But even that will be enough for the first test of this hypothesis that I am my connectome.": 1,
    " For now, let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis, that it's actually worth taking seriously.": 1,
    " As you grow during childhood and age during adulthood, your personal identity changes slowly.": 1,
    "Likewise, every connectome changes over time.": 1,
    " What kinds of changes happen?": 1,
    "Well, neurons like trees can grow new branches, and they can lose old ones.": 1,
    " Synapses can be created and they can be eliminated.": 1,
    "And synapses can grow larger and they can grow smaller.": 1,
    " Second question, what causes these changes?": 1,
    " Well, it's true.": 1,
    "To some extent, they are programmed by your genes, but that's not the whole story.": 1,
    " because there are signals, electrical signals that travel along the branches of neurons and chemical signals that jump across from branch to branch.": 1,
    "These signals are called neural activity.": 1,
    "And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity": 1,
    " is encoding our thoughts, feelings, and perceptions, our mental experiences.": 1,
    "And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity can cause your connections to change.": 1,
    "And if you put those two facts together,": 1,
    " It means that your experiences can change your connectome.": 1,
    " And that's why every connectome is unique, even those of genetically identical twins.": 1,
    " The connectome is where nature meets nurture.": 1,
    " And it might be true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome, an idea that you may find empowering.": 1,
    " What's in this picture?": 1,
    " A cool and refreshing stream of water, you say.": 1,
    " What else is in this picture?": 1,
    " Do not forget that groove in the earth called the stream bed.": 1,
    " Without it, the water would not know in which direction to flow.": 1,
    "And with this stream, I would like to propose a metaphor for the relationship between neural activity and connectivity.": 1,
    " Neural activity is constantly changing.": 1,
    "It's like the water of the stream.": 1,
    "It never sits still.": 1,
    " The connections of the brain's neural network determine the pathways along which neural activity flows.": 1,
    "And so the connectome is like the bed of the stream.": 1,
    " But the metaphor is richer than that, because it's true that the stream bed guides the flow of the water.": 1,
    " But over long time scales, the water also reshapes the bed of the stream.": 1,
    "And as I told you just now, neural activity can change the connectome.": 1,
    " and if you'll allow me to ascend to metaphorical heights.": 1,
    " I will remind you that neural activity is the physical basis, or so neuroscientists think, of thoughts, feelings, and perceptions.": 1,
    "And so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness.": 1,
    " Neural activity is its water.": 1,
    " and the connectome is its best.": 1,
    " So let's return from the heights of metaphor and return to science.": 1,
    "Suppose our technologies for finding connectomes actually work.": 1,
    "How will we go about testing the hypothesis, I am my connectome?": 1,
    " Well, I propose a direct test.": 1,
    "Let us attempt to read out memories from connectomes.": 1,
    " Consider the memory of long temporal sequences of movements, like a pianist playing a Beethoven sonata.": 1,
    " According to a theory that dates back to the 19th century, such memories are stored as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain.": 1,
    " Because if the first neurons in the chain are activated, through their synapses they send messages to the second neurons which are activated.": 1,
    "And so on down the line, like a chain of falling dominoes.": 1,
    " And this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of the sequence of movements.": 1,
    " So one way of trying to test the theory is to look for such chains inside connectomes.": 1,
    "But it won't be easy because they're not going to look like this.": 1,
    " they're going to be scrambled up.": 1,
    "And so we'll have to use our computers to try to unscramble the chain.": 1,
    "And if we can do that, the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling will be a prediction.": 1,
    " of the pattern of neural activity that is replayed in the brain during memory recall.": 1,
    "And if that were successful, that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome.": 1,
    " What a mess.": 1,
    " Have you ever tried to wire up a system as complex as this?": 1,
    "I hope not.": 1,
    "But if you have, you know it's very easy to make a mistake.": 1,
    " The branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain.": 1,
    "Can anyone guess what's the total length of wires in your brain?": 1,
    " I'll give you a hand, it's a big number.": 1,
    " I estimate millions of miles.": 1,
    " all packed in your skull.": 1,
    "And if you appreciate that number,": 1,
    " you can easily see there is huge potential for miswiring of the brain.": 1,
    "And indeed, the popular press loves headlines like, anorexic brains are wired differently, or autistic brains are wired differently.": 1,
    " These are plausible claims, but in truth, we can't see the brain's wiring clearly enough to tell if these are really true.": 1,
    "And so the technologies for seeing connectomes will allow us to finally read": 1,
    " miswiring of the brain to see mental disorders in connectomes.": 1,
    " Sometimes.": 1,
    " The best way to test a hypothesis is to consider its most extreme implication.": 1,
    "Philosophers know this game very well.": 1,
    " If you believe that I am my connectome, I think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connectome.": 1,
    " I mention this because there are prophets today who claim that technology will fundamentally alter the human condition and perhaps even transform the human species.": 1,
    " One of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics.": 1,
    " If you pay $100,000, you can arrange to have your body frozen after death and stored in liquid nitrogen in one of these tanks in an Arizona warehouse, awaiting a future civilization that is advanced enough to resurrect you.": 1,
    " Should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality, calling them fools?": 1,
    "Or will they someday chuckle over our graves?": 1,
    " I don't know.": 1,
    "I prefer to test their beliefs scientifically.": 1,
    " I propose that we attempt to find a connectome of a frozen brain.": 1,
    "We know that damage to the brain occurs after death and during freezing.": 1,
    "The question is, has that damage erased the connectome?": 1,
    " There is no way that any future civilization will be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains.": 1,
    "Resurrection might succeed for the body, but not for the mind.": 1,
    " On the other hand, if the connectome is still intact, we cannot ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily.": 1,
    " I have described a quest that begins in the world of the very small and propels us to the world of the far future.": 1,
    " Connectomes will mark a turning point in human history.": 1,
    " As we evolved from our ape-like ancestors on the African savanna, what distinguished us was our larger brains.": 1,
    " We have used our brains to fashion ever more amazing technologies.": 1,
    "Eventually, these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves.": 1,
    " by deconstructing and reconstructing our own brains.": 1,
    " I believe that this voyage of self-discovery is not just for scientists, but for all of us.": 1,
    "And I'm grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
