    " I'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back just the way I am.": 1,
    "Kind of a royal wave.": 1,
    "You can mimic what you can see.": 1,
    "You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm.": 1,
    "Soon you'll be able to look inside your brain": 1,
    " and program control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there.": 1,
    "I'm going to tell you about that technology.": 1,
    "People have wanted to look inside the human mind, the human brain,": 1,
    " for thousands of years.": 1,
    "Well, coming out of the research labs just now for our generation is the possibility to do that.": 1,
    "People envision this as being very difficult.": 1,
    "You had to take a spaceship, shrink it down, inject it into the bloodstream.": 1,
    "It was terribly dangerous.": 1,
    " You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries.": 1,
    "But now we have a real technology to do this.": 1,
    "We're going to fly into my colleague Peter's brain.": 1,
    "We're going to do it non-invasively using MRI.": 1,
    "We don't have to inject anything.": 1,
    " We don't need radiation.": 1,
    "We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain, literally fly into his body.": 1,
    "But more importantly, we can look at his mind.": 1,
    "When Peter moves his arm, that yellow spot you see there": 1,
    " is the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place.": 1,
    "Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms, that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains.": 1,
    "What's new is that that process has typically taken": 1,
    " days or months of analysis.": 1,
    "We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds, and that allows us to let Peter look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner.": 1,
    " he can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second.": 1,
    "If he can see this pattern in his own brain, he can learn how to control it.": 1,
    "There have been three ways to try to impact the brain.": 1,
    " the therapist's couch, pills, and the knife.": 1,
    "This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have.": 1,
    "We all know": 1,
    " that as we form thoughts, they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains.": 1,
    "Chronic pain is an example.": 1,
    "If you burn yourself, you pull your hand away.": 1,
    "But if you're still in pain in six months or six years' time,": 1,
    " It's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you.": 1,
    "If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain,": 1,
    " we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information and then we can select the areas that produce the pain.": 1,
    "So put your arms back up and flex your bicep.": 1,
    " Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing.": 1,
    "What you're seeing here is we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient.": 1,
    " This may shock you, but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time.": 1,
    "They're watching their own brain activation, and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain.": 1,
    " They are learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates.": 1,
    "As they do it, in the upper left is a display that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled.": 1,
    " When they control their brain, they can control their pain.": 1,
    "This is an investigational technology, but in clinical trials we're seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients.": 1,
    " This is not the matrix.": 1,
    "You can only do this to yourself.": 1,
    "You take control.": 1,
    "I've seen inside my brain.": 1,
    "You will tune soon.": 1,
    " When you do, what do you want to control?": 1,
    "You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself, all your experiences.": 1,
    " These are some of the areas that we're working on today that I don't have time to go into in detail, but I want to leave with you the big question.": 1,
    "We are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into, using this technology, the human mind and brain.": 1,
    " Where will we take it?": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
