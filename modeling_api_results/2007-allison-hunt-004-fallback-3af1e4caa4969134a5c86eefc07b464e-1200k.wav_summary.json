    " My three minutes hasn't started yet, has it?": 1,
    "No, you can't stop the three minutes.": 1,
    "Reset the three minutes.": 1,
    "That's just not good.": 1,
    "Oh my god, it's harsh up here.": 1,
    "I mean, I'm nervous enough as it is.": 1,
    " But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago.": 1,
    "Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery.": 1,
    "Do you know that surgery?": 1,
    "Electric saw, power drill.": 1,
    " Totally disgusting, unless you're David Bolinski, in which case it's all truth and beauty.": 1,
    "Sure, David, if it's not your hip, it's truth and beauty.": 1,
    " Anyway, I did have a really big epiphany around the situation, so Chris invited me to tell you about it.": 1,
    "But first, you need to know two things about me.": 1,
    "Just two things.": 1,
    "I'm Canadian.": 1,
    " and on the youngest of seven kids.": 1,
    "Now, in Canada, we have that great healthcare system that means we get our new hits for free.": 1,
    "And being the youngest of seven, I have never been at the front of the line for anything.": 1,
    " Okay?": 1,
    "So my hip had been hurting me for years.": 1,
    "I finally went to the doctor, which was free, and she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon, also free.": 1,
    " Finally get to see him after 10 months of waiting, almost a year.": 1,
    "That is what free gets you.": 1,
    " I met the surgeon and he took some free x-rays and I got a good look at them and you know even I could tell my hip was bad and I actually work in marketing.": 1,
    " So he said, Allison, we've got to get you on the table.": 1,
    "I'm going to replace your hip.": 1,
    "It's about an 18-month wait.": 1,
    "18 more months.": 1,
    "I'd already waited 10 months, and I had to wait 18 more months.": 1,
    " You know, it's such a long wait that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TEDs.": 1,
    "I wouldn't have my new hip for this TED.": 1,
    "I wouldn't have my new hip for TED Global in Africa.": 1,
    "I would not have my new hip for TED 2008.": 1,
    "I would still be on my bad hip.": 1,
    " That was so disappointing.": 1,
    "So I left his office and I was walking through the hospital and that's when I had my epiphany.": 1,
    "This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line.": 1,
    " Oh yeah.": 1,
    "Can I tell you how un-Canadian that is?": 1,
    " We do not think that way.": 1,
    "We don't talk about it.": 1,
    "It's not even a consideration.": 1,
    "In fact, when we're traveling abroad, it's how we identify fellow Canadians.": 1,
    "After you.": 1,
    "Oh, no, no, after you.": 1,
    "Hey, are you from Canada?": 1,
    "Oh, me too.": 1,
    "Hi.": 1,
    " Great!": 1,
    "Excellent.": 1,
    "So no, suddenly I wasn't adverse to budding any geezer off the list.": 1,
    "Some 70-year-old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing or gardening.": 1,
    "No, no.": 1,
    "Front of the line.": 1,
    " So by now I was walking in the lobby and of course that hurt my hip.": 1,
    "I kind of needed a sign and I saw a sign.": 1,
    " In the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop, there was a sign that said, volunteers needed.": 1,
    " Hmm.": 1,
    "Well, they signed me up immediately.": 1,
    "No reference checks, none of the usual background stuff.": 1,
    "No, they were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75.": 1,
    " They needed some young blood.": 1,
    "So, next thing you know, I had my bright blue volunteer vest, I had my photo ID, and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss.": 1,
    "I worked alone every Friday morning.": 1,
    "I was at the gift shop.": 1,
    " While ringing in hospital staff's tic-tacs, I'd casually ask, what do you do?": 1,
    " Then I tell them, well, I'm getting my hip replaced in 18 months.": 1,
    "It's gonna be so great when the pain stops.": 1,
    " All the staff got to know the plucky young volunteer.": 1,
    " My next surgeon's appointment was coincidentally right after a shift at the gift shop.": 1,
    "So naturally I had my vest and my identification.": 1,
    "I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office.": 1,
    "And you know, when he walked in, I could just tell that he saw them.": 1,
    " Moments later, I had a surgery date just weeks away, and a big fat prescription for Percocet.": 1,
    " Now, word on the street is that it was actually my volunteering that got me to the front of the line.": 1,
    "And you know, I'm not even ashamed of that.": 1,
    "Two reasons.": 1,
    "First of all, I am going to take such good care of this new hip.": 1,
    " But also, I intend to stick with the volunteering, which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all.": 1,
    "Even when a Canadian cheats the system, they do it in a way that benefits society.": 1
