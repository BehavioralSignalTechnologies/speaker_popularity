    " With the help of IIT, Terry, and learnings from NASA, we discovered that there are three basic green plants, common green plants, with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors": 1,
    " to keep us healthy.": 1,
    "We've also found that you can reduce the fresh air requirements into the building while maintaining industry indoor air quality standards.": 1,
    " The three plants are Arikapam, Mother-in-law's tongue, and money plant.": 1,
    "The botanical names are in front of you.": 1,
    " Arika palm is a plant which removes CO2 and converts it into oxygen.": 1,
