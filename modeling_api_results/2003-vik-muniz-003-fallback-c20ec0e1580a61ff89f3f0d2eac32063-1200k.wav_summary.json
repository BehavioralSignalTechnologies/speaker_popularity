    " I was asked to come here and speak about creation.": 1,
    "And I only have 15 minutes.": 1,
    "I see the counting already.": 1,
    "And I can, in 15 minutes, I think I can touch only a very, a rather janitorial branch of creation.": 1,
    " which I call creativity.": 1,
    "Creativity is how we cope with creation.": 1,
    "While creation sometimes seems a bit ungraspable or even pointless.": 1,
    " Creativity is always meaningful.": 1,
    "Say, for instance, in this picture.": 1,
    "You know, creation is what put that dog in that picture, and creativity is what make us see a chicken on his hindquarters.": 1,
    " When you think about, creativity has a lot to do with causality too.": 1,
    "When I was a teenager, I was a creator.": 1,
    " I just did things and I became an adult and started knowing who I was and tried to maintain the persona.": 1,
    "I became creative.": 1,
    " It wasn't until I actually did a book in a retrospective exhibition that I could track exactly": 1,
    " It looks like all the crazy things that I had done, all my drinking, all my parties, they found the straight line that brings me to the point that actually I'm talking to you at this moment.": 1,
    "Well, it's actually true, you know.": 1,
    " The reason I'm talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil.": 1,
    "If I was born in Monterey, I probably would be in Brazil.": 1,
    "I was born in Brazil and grew up in the 70s under a climate of political distress.": 1,
    " And I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way, in a sort of a semiotic black market.": 1,
    "You couldn't really say what you wanted to say.": 1,
    "You have to invent ways of doing it.": 1,
    "You didn't trust information very much.": 1,
    " That led me to another step of why I'm here today is because I really liked media of all kinds.": 1,
    "I was a media junkie and eventually got involved with advertising.": 1,
    " My first job in Brazil was actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards, and based on speed, angle of approach, and actually blocks of text.": 1,
    " It was very, actually it was very good study and got me a job in an ad agency.": 1,
    "And they also decided that I had to give me a very ugly plexiglass trophy for it.": 1,
    " And another point while I'm here is that the day I went to pick up the Plexiglas trophy, I rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life.": 1,
    " Pick the thing, didn't have any friends.": 1,
    "On my way out, I had to break a fight apart.": 1,
    "Somebody was hitting somebody else with breast knuckles.": 1,
    "They were in tuxedos and fighting, very ugly.": 1,
    "And also, advertising people do that all the time.": 1,
    " Well, what happened is when I went back, was on my way back to my car, the guy who got hit decided to grab a gun, I don't know where he had a gun, and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor.": 1,
    "The first person was area black, of Tuxedo.": 1,
    "It was me.": 1,
    " Luckily, it wasn't fatal, as you can all see.": 1,
    "And even more luckily, the guy said that he was sorry and I bribed him for compensation money, otherwise I'd press charges.": 1,
    " With this money, I paid a ticket to come to the United States in 1983.": 1,
    "That's the basic reason I'm talking to you here today, because I got shot.": 1,
    " Well.": 1,
    " When I started working with my own work, I decided that I shouldn't do images.": 1,
    "I took this very iconoclastic approach.": 1,
    "Because when I decided to go into advertising, I wanted to do": 1,
    " And I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice for whiskey commercials.": 1,
    "That's what I really wanted to do.": 1,
    "But they didn't let me do it.": 1,
    "So they only let me do other things.": 1,
    "But I wasn't into selling whiskey.": 1,
    "I wasn't into selling ice.": 1,
    " The first words were actually objects.": 1,
    "It was kind of a mixture of found object, product design, and advertising.": 1,
    "And I called them relics.": 1,
    "They were displayed first at Stuck's Gallery in 1983.": 1,
    "This is the clown skull.": 1,
    "It's a relic.": 1,
    " of a race, a very evolved race of entertainers.": 1,
    "They lived in Brazil a long time ago.": 1,
    " This is the Ashanti joystick.": 1,
    "Unfortunately, it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform.": 1,
    "PlayStation 2 is in the works.": 1,
    "Maybe for the next 10, I'll bring it.": 1,
    "The rocking podium.": 1,
    " This is the pre-Columbian coffee maker.": 1,
    " Actually, the idea came out of an argument that I had on Starbucks that I insisted that I wasn't having Colombian coffee.": 1,
    "The coffee was actually pre-Columbian.": 1,
    " The both side table.": 1,
    " The entire Encyclopedia Britannica bound in a single volume for travel purposes.": 1,
    " And a half thumb stone for people who are not dead yet.": 1,
    " for some.": 1,
    " I wanted to take that into the realm of images, and I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts.": 1,
    "So I decided to do work with clouds, because clouds can mean anything you want.": 1,
    " But I wanted to work in a very low tech way, so something that would mean at the same time a lump of cotton, a cloud, and Durer's praying hands, although this looks more like Mickey Mouse's praying hands.": 1,
    " But I would still, you know, this is a kitty cloud.": 1,
    " They're called equivalents after Alfred Stiglitz's work, The Snail.": 1,
    "But I was still working with sculpture.": 1,
    "And I was really trying to go flatter and flatter.": 1,
    " I had a chance to go to Florence in, I think it was in 1994, and I saw Ghiberti's Door of Paradise, and he did something that was very tricky.": 1,
    " Put together two different media from different periods of time.": 1,
    "First he got, you know, no age old way of making images, which was relief.": 1,
    " And he worked this with three point perspective, which was brand new technology at the time.": 1,
    "And it's totally overkill and your eye doesn't know which": 1,
    " level to read and you become trapped into this kind of representation.": 1,
    "So I decided to make these very simple renderings that at first they are": 1,
    " taken as a line drawing, something that I did with wire.": 1,
    "The idea was to, because everybody overlooks why": 1,
    " Like pencil drawings, you know, and they will look at it as a pencil drawing.": 1,
    "Then you have this double take and see that it's actually something that existed in time.": 1,
    "It had a physicality and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes": 1,
    " this way towards the image.": 1,
    "So this is a monkey with Leica.": 1,
    " Relaxation.": 1,
    " Fiat Lux.": 1,
    " And the same way the history of representation evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings, and I wanted to deal with other subjects, I started taking that into the realm of landscape, which is something that's almost a picture of nothing.": 1,
    " I made these pictures called pictures of thread, and I named them after the amount of yards that I used to represent each picture.": 1,
    "These always end up being a photograph at the end, or more like an etchy in this case.": 1,
    "So this is a lighthouse.": 1,
    " This is 6,500 years after Coho.": 1,
    " 9,000 years after Gerhard wished her.": 1,
    " And I don't know how many hours after John Constable.": 1,
    " Departing from the lines, I decided to tackle the idea of points, which was more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves.": 1,
    "I had met a group of children in the Caribbean island of St.": 1,
    "Kitts, and I did": 1,
    " work and play with them.": 1,
    "I got some photographs from them.": 1,
    "Upon my arrival in New York, I decided they were children of plantation, sugar plantation workers.": 1,
    "And by manipulating sugar over black paper, I made portraits of them.": 1,
    " These are, thank you.": 1,
    " Since Valentina, the fastest.": 1,
    "It was just the name of the child with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly.": 1,
    " Valishen.": 1,
    " It's a scene that...": 1,
    " But another layer of representation was still introduced.": 1,
    "Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures, I realized that I could add still another thing.": 1,
    "And I was trying to make a subject, something that would interfere": 1,
    " with the theme.": 1,
    "So chocolate is very good because it brings to mind ideas that go from": 1,
    " Scatology to romance.": 1,
    "And so I decided to make these pictures.": 1,
    "And they were very large, so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them.": 1,
    "So they're called pictures of chocolate.": 1,
    "Freud probably could explain chocolate better than I. It was the first subject.": 1,
    " And Jackson Pollock also.": 1,
    " Pictures of crowds are particularly interesting because you try to figure out the threshold with something that you identify very easily, like a face goes into becoming just a texture, paparazzi.": 1,
    " I used the dust of the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection.": 1,
    "And I picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity.": 1,
    "And you render this with the most known specific material, which is dust itself.": 1,
    " It has the skin particles of every single museum visitor.": 1,
    "If they do a DNA scan of this, they will come up with a great mailing list.": 1,
    " This is Richard Serra.": 1,
    " I bought a computer and Tommy had millions of colors in it.": 1,
    "You know, an artist's first response to this is, who counted it?": 1,
    " I realized that I never worked with color because I had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors.": 1,
    "But once they're applied to numeric structure, then you...": 1,
    " you can, you feel more comfortable.": 1,
    "So the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches.": 1,
    "They end up being very large pictures and I photographed with a very large camera made by 10 cameras so you can see the surface of every single": 1,
    " like in this picture of Chuck Close.": 1,
    "And you have to walk very far to be able to see it.": 1,
    " Also, the reference to Gertrude Itcher use of color charts.": 1,
    "And the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today, which is the bitmap.": 1,
    " I ended up narrowing the subject to money haystacks.": 1,
    " This is something I used to do as a joke.": 1,
    "Make the same like Robert Smith in Spiral Jet and then leaving traces of as if he was done on a tabletop.": 1,
    "Like trying to prove that he didn't do that thing in the South Lake.": 1,
    " But then just doing the models, I was trying to explore the relationship between the model and the original.": 1,
    "And I felt that I would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself.": 1,
    " I opt for very simple line drawings, kind of stupid looking.": 1,
    "And at the same time, I was doing this very large construction to be 150 meters.": 1,
    " Now, I would do very small ones, which would be like, but under the same light.": 1,
    "And I would show them together, so the viewer would have to really figure out what he was looking.": 1,
    " I wasn't interested in the very large things or in the small things, but I was more interested in the things in between, you know, because you leave an enormous range for ambiguity there.": 1,
    " This is like you see the size of a person over there.": 1,
    " This is a pipe.": 1,
    " hangar": 1,
    " And this is another thing that I did.": 1,
    "I think everybody loves to watch somebody draw, but not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw, like a lot of people at the same time, to evidence a single drawing.": 1,
    " I love this work because I did this cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months.": 1,
    "And it was quite wonderful because I had an interest, an early interest in theater that's justified on this thing.": 1,
    "In theater you have": 1,
    " the character and the actor in the same place trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience.": 1,
    "And in this you would have something that looks like a cloud, and it is a cloud at the same time.": 1,
    "So they're like perfect actors.": 1,
    " My interest in acting, especially bad acting, goes a long way.": 1,
    "Actually, I once paid like $60 to see a very great actor to do a version of King Lear.": 1,
    " And I felt really robbed because by the time the actor started being King Lear, he stopped being the great actor that I had paid money to see.": 1,
    " On the other hand, I paid like three dollars, I think, and I went to a warehouse in Queens to see a version of": 1,
    " Hotelo, by an amateur group, and it was quite fascinating because, you know, the guy, his name was Joey Grimaldi, he impersonated the Moorish general, you know, the first three minutes he was really that general, and then he went into back in the plumber, he was...": 1,
    " worked as a plumber, so plumber, general, plumber, general.": 1,
    "So for three dollars I sought two tragedies for the price of one.": 1,
    " See, I think it's not really about impressing or making people fall for a really perfect illusion.": 1,
    "As much as it is to make, I usually work at the lowest threshold of visual.": 1,
    " because it's not about fooling somebody, it's actually giving somebody a measure of their own belief, how much you want to be fooled.": 1,
    "That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that.": 1,
    " Well, I think that's it, and my time is nearly up.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
