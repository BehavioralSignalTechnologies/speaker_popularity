    " Traditional prescriptions for growth in Africa are not working very well.": 1,
    " After $1 trillion in African development-related aid in the last 60 years, real per capita income today is lower than it was in the 1970s.": 1,
    " It is not doing too well.": 1,
    " In response, the Bretton Woods Institutions, the IMF and the World Bank pushed for free trade, not aid.": 1,
    " Yet the historical record shows little empirical evidence that free trade leads to economic growth.": 1,
    "The newly prescribed silver bullet is microcredit.": 1,
    " We seem to be fixated on this romanticized idea that every poor person in Africa is an entrepreneur.": 1,
    " Yet, my work and travel in 40-plus countries across Africa has taught me that most people want jobs instead.": 1,
    "My solution?": 1,
    "Forget micro-entrepreneurs.": 1,
    " Let's invest in building Pan-African titans like Sudanese businessman Mo Ibrahim.": 1,
    " Moore took a contrarian bet on Africa when he founded Seltel International in 1998 and built it into a mobile cellular provider.": 1,
    " with 24 million subscribers across 14 African countries by 2004.": 1,
    " The more model might be better than the everyman entrepreneur model, which prevents an effective means of diffusion and knowledge sharing.": 1,
    "Perhaps we are not at a stage in Africa where many actors and small enterprises leads to growth through competition.": 1,
    " Consider these two alternative scenarios.": 1,
    "One.": 1,
    " You loan $200 to each of 500 banana farmers, allowing them to dry their surplus bananas and fetch 15% more revenues at the local markets.": 1,
    " Or two, you give $100,000 to one savvy entrepreneur and help her set up a factory.": 1,
    " that yields 40% additional income to all 500 banana farmers and creates 50 additional jobs.": 1,
    " We invested in the second scenario and backed 26-year-old Kenyan entrepreneur Eric Mutomi to set up an agro-processing factory called Stawi to produce gluten-free banana-based flour.": 1,
    " and baby food.": 1,
    " Stawi is leveraging economies of scale and using modern manufacturing processes to create value for not only its owners, but its workers who have an ownership in the business.": 1,
    " Our dream is to take an Eric Mutomi and try to help him become a Mo Ibrahim, which requires skill, financing, local and global partnerships, and extraordinary perseverance.": 1,
    " But why Pan-African?": 1,
    " The Scramble for Africa joined the Berlin Conference of 1884, where, quite frankly, we Africans were not exactly consulted.": 1,
    " resulted in massive fragmentation in many sovereign states with small populations.": 1,
    "Liberia, 4 million, Cape Verde, 500,000.": 1,
    "Pan-Africa gives you 1 billion people, granted, across 55 countries with trade barriers and other impediments.": 1,
    " But our ancestors traded across the continent before Europeans drew lines around us.": 1,
    "The Pan-African opportunities outweigh the challenges.": 1,
    "And that's why we're expanding Starwiz markets from just Kenya to Algeria, Nigeria, Ghana,": 1,
    " and anywhere else that will buy our food.": 1,
    "We hope to help solve food security, empower farmers, create jobs, develop the local economy, and we hope to become rich in the process.": 1,
    " while it's not the sexiest approach.": 1,
    "And maybe it doesn't achieve the same feel good as giving a woman a hundred dollars to buy a goat on kiva.org.": 1,
    " And perhaps supporting fewer, higher-impact entrepreneurs to build massive businesses at scale, Pan-Africa, can help change this.": 1,
    " The political freedom for which our forbearers fought is meaningless without economic freedom.": 1,
    " We hope to aid this fight for economic freedom by building world-class businesses, creating indigenous wealth, providing jobs that we so desperately need, and hopefully helping achieve this.": 1,
    " Africa shall rise.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " So, Sangu, of course, this is strong rhetoric.": 1,
    "You're making 100% contrast between microcredit and regular investment and growing regular investment.": 1,
    "Do you think there is a role for microcredit at all?": 1,
    " I think there is a role.": 1,
    "Microcredit has been a great innovative way to expand financial access to the bottom of the pyramid.": 1,
    "But for the problems we face in Africa,": 1,
    " When we were looking at the Marshall Plan to revitalize water on Europe, it was not full of donations of sheep.": 1,
    "We need more than just microcredits.": 1,
    "We need more than just give $200.": 1,
    "We need to build big businesses, and we need jobs.": 1,
    "Very good.": 1,
    "Thank you so much.": 1
