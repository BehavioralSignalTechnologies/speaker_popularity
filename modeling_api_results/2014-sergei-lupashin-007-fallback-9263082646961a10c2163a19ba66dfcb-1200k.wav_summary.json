    " I came here to show you the photo guide.": 1,
    "It's a tethered flying camera.": 1,
    "But before I do that, I want to tell you a bit about where it came from, what motivated it.": 1,
    " So I was born in Russia and three years ago in 2011 there were the Russian federal elections.": 1,
    "There were massive irregularities reported and people came out to protest which was very unlikely for Russia.": 1,
    " And no one really knew how significant these protests were because for whatever reason the world media largely ignored it.": 1,
    " Now there was a group of photographers that kind of flew flying cameras as a hobby, usually photographing things like the Sphinx.": 1,
    " the pyramids, who happened to be right around the corner and they flew a camera and they took some snapshots, some panoramas of this demonstration.": 1,
    "Just completely independent entity, completely random occurrence.": 1,
    " And the image when I saw it, it really struck me.": 1,
    "Here's one of the panoramas.": 1,
    "So in a single image, you can really see the scale of this event.": 1,
    " I mean, just the number of people, the colors, the banners.": 1,
    "It's not that you just can't consider this insignificant.": 1,
    "All in a single image, which is really cool to me.": 1,
    " And I think in the future, journalism and many other professions, there are flying cameras already quite commonly out there.": 1,
    "But I think you wait a few months, a few years, and for many professions, it's really going to be a requirement.": 1,
    " And it makes sense.": 1,
    "It's such a unique perspective.": 1,
    "Nothing really communicates this scale, for example, in context in a way that this does.": 1,
    "But there are a few hurdles, and they're quite basic and quite fundamental.": 1,
    " One is piloting.": 1,
    "So for this image, they flew a camera, five kilogram device with an SLR under it.": 1,
    "You know, it's quite heavy, lots of spinning sharp things.": 1,
    " It's a bit uncomfortable to fly, probably also for the operator.": 1,
    "In fact, you can see that on the back of the pilot's shirt, it says, no questions until landing.": 1,
    " in Russian and in English.": 1,
    "Because people are curious and they'll go tap you and then you lose your focus and things happen.": 1,
    "And these guys are great.": 1,
    "They're professionals.": 1,
    "They're really careful in what they do.": 1,
    "So in the protest, maybe you noticed": 1,
    " They flew over the river, so it was quite safe.": 1,
    "But this doesn't necessarily apply to all people and all conditions, so we really have to make piloting easier.": 1,
    " The other problem is regulations, or rather the lack of good regulation.": 1,
    "For many good reasons, it's just difficult to come up with common sense laws to regulate flying cameras.": 1,
    " So we already have cameras, everyone here I'm sure has a smartphone with a camera.": 1,
    "There are more and more of them.": 1,
    "You hear about people with Google Glass being attacked.": 1,
    "You hear about actually a drone pilot, a hobbyist, was attacked two weeks ago because he was flying near a beach.": 1,
    " Here's some personal input I didn't expect.": 1,
    "Just yesterday, I was attacked by a guy who claimed that I was filming him.": 1,
    "I was checking my email right here.": 1,
    "Easier way to get inputs for your talk.": 1,
    " But I think there are better solutions.": 1,
    "I think we have to diffuse the situation.": 1,
    "We have to come up with responsible solutions that address the privacy issues and the safety accountability issues.": 1,
    " but still give us that perspective.": 1,
    "And this is one potential solution.": 1,
    "So this is the photokite.": 1,
    " Well, let me see, it's a quadrocopter, but what's kind of special about it is there's a leash.": 1,
    "It's literally a dog leash, it's very convenient.": 1,
    " And the neat thing about it is to fly it, there's no joysticks, nothing like this, you just turn it on.": 1,
    " and you point in the direction that you want to fly, you give it a little twist.": 1,
    "That's kind of the way you communicate.": 1,
    " And there it goes.": 1,
    " So the interaction is super simple.": 1,
    "It's like a personal flying pet.": 1,
    "It just always maintains a certain angle to you.": 1,
    "And if I move around with it,": 1,
    " it'll actually follow me naturally.": 1,
    "And of course we can build on top of this.": 1,
    "So this leash has some additional electronics, can turn it on.": 1,
    " And now it's like telling your dog to, well, fly lower if you have such a dog.": 1,
    "So I can press a button and manipulate it rather easily.": 1,
    "So I just shifted its position.": 1,
    " And it's really safe.": 1,
    "I mean, like, well, I don't know about you guys in the front row, but at least in principle, you have to agree that you feel safer because there's a physical connection.": 1,
    " Live demos are hard, right?": 1,
    "Things go wrong all the time.": 1,
    "But no matter what, this thing will actually prevent this thing from going into you.": 1,
    "What's more, it tells you immediately that I am the one responsible for this device.": 1,
    "You don't have to look for someone controlling it.": 1,
    " Now, I can tell you that it's easy, a lot, but I think a really good way to prove that is to grab a second one.": 1,
    " And, uh, and lunch it.": 1,
    " And if I can do this on stage live, then I can show each and every one of you in five minutes how to operate one of these devices.": 1,
    " So now we have two eyes in the sky.": 1,
    "Another trick is getting them back.": 1,
    " So my question now to you is, well, it's a nice solution, it's very accessible, it's safe.": 1,
    "What would you use it for?": 1,
    "What would you use such a camera for in your life?": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
