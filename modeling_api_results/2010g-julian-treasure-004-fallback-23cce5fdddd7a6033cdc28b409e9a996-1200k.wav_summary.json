    " The Hindus say one translation of which is the world is sound.": 1,
    "In a way, that's true because everything is vibrating.": 1,
    "In fact, all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating.": 1,
    "Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies.": 1,
    " So you are in fact a chord, each of you an individual chord.": 1,
    "One definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony.": 1,
    " Your ears can't hear that chord.": 1,
    "They can hear amazing things.": 1,
    "Your ears can hear ten octaves.": 1,
    "Incidentally, we see just one octave.": 1,
    "Your ears are always on.": 1,
    "You have no ear lids.": 1,

    "Whereas hearing is passive, listening is something that we have to work at.": 1,
    "It's a relationship with sound.": 1,
    "And yet it's a skill that none of us are taught.": 1,
    "For example, have you ever considered that there are listening positions?": 1,
    "Places you can listen from?": 1,
    "Here are two of them.": 1,
    " Reductive listening is listening for.": 1,
    "It reduces everything down to what's relevant, and it discards everything that's not relevant.": 1,
    "Men typically listen reductively, so he's saying, I've got this problem, here's your solution, thanks very much, next.": 1,

    "It's got no destination in mind, it's just enjoying the journey.": 1,
    "Women typically listen expansively.": 1,
    "If you look at these two, eye contact facing each other, possibly both talking at the same time.": 1,
    " Men, if you get nothing else out of this talk, practice expansive listening and you can transform your relationships.": 1,
    " The trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise surrounding us all the time.": 1,
    "Noise like this, according to the European Union, is reducing the health and the quality of life of 25% of the population of Europe.": 1,
    " 2% of the population of Europe, that's 16 million people are having their sleep devastated by noise like that.": 1,
    " Noise kills 200,000 people a year in Europe.": 1,
    "It's a really big problem.": 1,
    "Now, when you were little, if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it, you'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum.": 1,
    "These days, you can do a similar thing.": 1,
    "It just looks a bit cooler.": 1,

    " The trouble with widespread headphone use is that it brings three really big health issues.": 1,
    "The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined, Schizophrenia.": 1,
    "It's a dislocation between what you see and what you hear.": 1,

    "I think there's something deeply unhealthy about living all the time in Schizophrenia.": 1,
    " The second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression.": 1,
    "We squash music to fit it into our pocket.": 1,
    "And there is a cost attached to this.": 1,
    "Listen to this.": 1,

    " I do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two.": 1,
    "There is a cost of compression.": 1,
    "It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data.": 1,
    "You're having to imagine it.": 1,
    "It's not good for you in the long run.": 1,
    "The third problem with headphones is this.": 1,
    "Deafness.": 1,

    "Professional hearing protectors are great.": 1,

    "It's also now being used to treat cancer.": 1,
    " Lithotripsy, saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel by pulverising stones with high-intensity sound.": 1,
