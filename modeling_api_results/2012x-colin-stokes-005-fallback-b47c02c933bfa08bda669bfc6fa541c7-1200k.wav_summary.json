    " My favorite part of being a dad is the movies I get to watch.": 1,
    " I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids.": 1,
    "And when my daughter was four, we got to watch The Wizard of Oz together.": 1,
    "Totally dominated her imagination for months.": 1,
    "Her favorite character was Glinda, of course.": 1,
    " have a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand.": 1,
    "But you know, you watch a movie enough times and you start to realize how unusual it is.": 1,
    "Now we live today and are raising our children in a kind of": 1,
    " Children's Fantasy Spectacular Industrial Complex": 1,
    " But the Wizard of Oz stood alone.": 1,
    "It did not start that trend.": 1,
    " Forty years later was when the trend really caught on with, interestingly, another movie that featured a metal guy and a furry guy rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy's guards.": 1,
    " Do you know what I'm talking about?": 1,
    " Yeah.": 1,
    " Now...": 1,
    " There's a big difference between these two movies, a couple of really big differences between The Wizard of Oz and all the movies we watched today.": 1,
    "One is there's very little violence in The Wizard of Oz.": 1,
    "The monkeys are rather aggressive as are the apple trees.": 1,
    " But I think if the Wizard of Oz were made today, the wizard would say, Dorothy, you are the savior of Oz that the prophecy foretold.": 1,
    "Use your magic slippers to defeat the computer-generated armies of the Wicked Witch.": 1,
    " But that's not how it happens.": 1,
    "Another thing that's really unique about The Wizard of Oz to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female.": 1,
    " Now, I started to notice this when I actually showed Star Wars to my daughter, which was years later, and the situation was different.": 1,
    "At that point, I also had a son.": 1,
    " uh... he was only three at the time he was not invited to the screening he's too young for that uh... but he was a second child and the level of supervision had plummeted so uh... he wandered in": 1,
    " And it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling.": 1,
    " And I don't think you understand what's going on, but he is sure soaking in it.": 1,
    "And I wonder what he's soaking in.": 1,
    "Is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty?": 1,
    " Is he picking up on the fact that Luke joins an army to overthrow the government?": 1,
    " Is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for Aunt Beru and of course this princess who's really cool?": 1,
    " but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe, which he does by the magic that he was born with.": 1,
    " Compare this to 1939 with The Wizard of Oz.": 1,
    "How does Dorothy win her movie?": 1,
    " by making friends with everybody and being a leader.": 1,
    "Like, that's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in.": 1,
    "Oz, right?": 1,
    "And not the world of dudes fighting.": 1,
    " which is where we kind of have to be.": 1,
    "Why is there so much force, capital F force, in the movies we have for our kids, and so Little Yellow Brick Road?": 1,
    " I mean there is a lot of great writing about the impact that the boy violent movie has on girls and you should do that reading, it's very good.": 1,
    " I haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe.": 1,
    "I know from my own experience that": 1,
    " Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context that I could have used in navigating the adult world that is co-ed.": 1,
    " I think there was a kind of first kiss moment when I really expected the credits to start rolling because that's the end of the movie, right?": 1,
    "I finished my quest, I got the girl, why are you still standing there?": 1,
    " I don't know what I'm supposed to do.": 1,
    "The movies are very, very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward, and there's not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys.": 1,
    " It's almost as though, if you're a boy, you are a dopey animal, and if you were a girl, you should bring your warrior costume.": 1,
    " I mean, there are plenty of exceptions and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any of you.": 1,
    " But they do send a message to boys that the boys are not really the target audience.": 1,
    "I mean, they are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy.": 1,
    " But they are not necessarily showing boys how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy.": 1,
    "There are no models for them.": 1,
    " And we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids.": 1,
    "And as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are, these are still war movies.": 1,
    " and, of course, the most successful studio of all time.": 1,
    " continues to crank out classic after classic, every single one of them about the journey of a boy.": 1,
    " or a man or two men who are friends or a man and his son or two men who are raising a little girl.": 1,
    " Until, as many of you were thinking, this year, when they finally came out with Brave.": 1,
    "I recommend it to all of you.": 1,
    "It's on demand now.": 1,
    " Um, you remember what the critics said when Brave came out?": 1,
    "Oh, I can't believe Pixar made a princess movie.": 1,
    " It's very good.": 1,
    "Don't let that stop you.": 1,
    "Now, almost none of these movies pass the Bechtel test.": 1,
    "I don't know if you've heard of this.": 1,
    "It has not yet caught on and caught fire, but maybe today we will start a movement.": 1,
    " Allison Bechdel is a comic book artist, and back in the mid-80s, she recorded this conversation she'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw.": 1,
    "And it's very simple, there's just three questions you should ask.": 1,
    " Is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines?": 1,
    " So try to meet that bar.": 1,
    "And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie?": 1,
    " And is there conversation about something other than the guy that they both like?": 1,
    " All right?": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " Thank you very much": 1,
    " two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff.": 1,
    " it.": 1,
    " It does happen.": 1,
    "I've seen it.": 1,
    "And yet I very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love.": 1,
    "In fact, this week I went to see a very high quality movie, Argo.": 1,
    " Oscar buzz, doing great at the box office, a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is.": 1,
    "Pretty much flunks the Bechtel test.": 1,
    " And I don't think it should because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis.": 1,
    " We got quite a few scenes of the men having deep, angst-ridden conversations in this hideout.": 1,
    "And the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say, are you coming to bed, honey?": 1,
    " That's Hollywood for you.": 1,
    "So let's look at the numbers.": 1,
    "2011 of the 100 most popular movies.": 1,
    "How many of them do you think actually have female protagonists?": 1,
    " Eleven.": 1,
    "It's not bad.": 1,
    "It's not as many percent as the number of women we've just elected to Congress, so that's good.": 1,
    " But there is a number that is greater than this that's going to bring this room down.": 1,
    "Last year, the New York Times published a study that the government had done.": 1,
    "Here's what it said, one out of five": 1,
    " Women in America say that they have been sexually assaulted sometime in their life.": 1,
    " Now, I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment.": 1,
    "I don't think kids movies have anything to do with that.": 1,
    "I don't even think that, you know, music videos or pornography are really directly related to that, but something is going wrong.": 1,
    " You're welcome.": 1,
    " And when I hear that statistic, one of the things I think of is that's a lot of sexual assailants.": 1,
    " Who are these guys?": 1,
    "What are they learning?": 1,
    "What are they failing to learn?": 1,
    " Are they absorbing the story that a male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect a reward which is a woman who has no friends and doesn't speak?": 1,
    " Are we soaking up that story?": 1,
    " You know...": 1,
    " as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter.": 1,
    " Like all of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this statistic very alarming and we want to prepare them.": 1,
    "We have tools at our disposal like girl power,": 1,
    " And we hope that that will help.": 1,
    "But I've got to wonder, is girl power going to protect them if at the same time, actively or passively, we are training our sons to maintain their boy power?": 1,
    " I mean, I think the Netflix queue is one way that we can do something very important.": 1,
    "And I'm talking mainly to the dads here.": 1,
    " I think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood.": 1,
    " Now, the definition of manhood is already turning upside down.": 1,
    "You've read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner.": 1,
    "They're throwing it up in the air.": 1,
    " So our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this, some new relationship with each other.": 1,
    "And I think we really have to show them and model for them.": 1,
    " how a real man is someone who trusts his sisters and respects them and wants to be on their team and stands up against the real bad guys.": 1,
    " who are the men who want to abuse the women.": 1,
    " And I think our job in the Netflix queue is to look out for those movies that pass the Bechtel test, if we can find them.": 1,
    "And to seek out the heroines who are there.": 1,
    " who show real courage, who bring people together, and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines.": 1,
    " and to say, I want to be on their team, because they're going to be on their team.": 1,
    " When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in Star Wars, you know what she said?": 1,
    " Only one.": 1,
    " Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.": 1,
    " Now what do these two have in common?": 1,
    " Maybe it's not just the sparkly dress.": 1,
    "I think these people are experts.": 1,
    "I think these are the two people in the movie who know more than anybody else and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.": 1,
    " Now they're leaders.": 1,
    "I like that kind of quest for my daughter.": 1,
    "And I like that kind of quest for my son.": 1,
    "I want more quests like that.": 1,
    "I want fewer quests where my son is told, go out and fight it alone.": 1,
    " and more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team.": 1,
    " Maybe a team led by women.": 1,
    " to help other people.": 1,
    " become better.": 1,
    " and be better people, like the Wizard of Oz.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
