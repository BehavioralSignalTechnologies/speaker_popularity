    "That was important.": 3,
    "Get back.": 3,
    "No, no, no, no, no.": 2,
    "That's right.": 2,
    "John.": 2,
    " I am no designer.": 1,
    "Nope.": 1,
    "New way.": 1,
    " My dad was, which was kind of an interesting way to grow up, I had to figure out what it is my dad did and why it was important.": 1,
    "Dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up.": 1,
    " Bad design is just people not thinking, John.": 1,
    "You would say whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower or say a typewriter ribbon would get tangled or an egg beater would get jammed in the kitchen.": 1,
    " design, bad design, there's just no excuse for it.": 1,
    "It's letting stuff happen without thinking about it.": 1,
    "Every object should be about something, John.": 1,
    "It should imagine a user.": 1,
    "It should cast that user": 1,
    " in a story starring the user and the object.": 1,
    "Good design, my dad said, is about supplying intent.": 1,
    " That's what he said.": 1,
    "Dad helped design the control panels for the IBM 360 computer.": 1,
    " That was a big deal.": 1,
    "He worked for Kodak for a while.": 1,
    "He designed chairs and desks and other office equipment for steel case.": 1,
    "I knew design was important in my house because, for heaven's sakes, it put food on our table.": 1,
    " And design was in everything my dad did.": 1,
    " He had a Dixieland jazz band when we were growing up.": 1,
    "And he would always cover Louis Armstrong tunes.": 1,
    "And I would ask him every once in a while, Dad, do you want it to sound like the record?": 1,
    "We had lots of old jazz records lying around the house.": 1,
    "And he said, no, never, John, never.": 1,
    " The song is just a given.": 1,
    "That's how you have to think about it.": 1,
    "You gotta make it your own.": 1,
    "You gotta design it.": 1,
    "Show everyone what you intend, is what he said.": 1,
    "Doing that, acting by design, is what we all should be doing.": 1,
    " It's where we all belong.": 1,
    "All of us?": 1,
    "Designers?": 1,
    "Oh, oh, Dad.": 1,
    "Oh, Dad.": 1,
    "The song is just a given.": 1,
    " It's how you cover it that matters.": 1,
    "Well, let's hold on to that thought for just a minute.": 1,
    "It's kind of like this wheelchair I'm in, right?": 1,
    "The original tune, it's a little scary.": 1,
    "Ooh, what happened to that dude?": 1,
    "He can't walk.": 1,
    " Anybody know the story?": 1,
    "Anybody?": 1,
    "I don't like to talk about this very much, but I'll tell you guys the story today.": 1,
    "Alright, exactly 36 years ago, this week, that's right, I was in a poorly designed automobile.": 1,
    " that hit a poorly designed guardrail on a poorly designed road in Pennsylvania and plummeted down a 200 foot embankment and killed two people in the car.": 1,
    " But ever since then, the wheelchair has been a given in my life.": 1,
    "My life at the mercy of good design and bad design.": 1,
    "Think about it now, in design terms, a wheelchair is a very difficult object.": 1,
    " It mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune, and it projects that message, that story, so strongly that it almost blots out anything else.": 1,
    "I roll swiftly through an airport, right, and moms grab their kids out of the way.": 1,
    " don't stare.": 1,
    "And the poor kid, you know, has this terrified look on his face.": 1,
    "God knows what they think.": 1,
    "And for decades, you know, I'm going, why does this happen?": 1,
    "What can I do about it?": 1,
    "How can I change this?": 1,
    "I mean, there must be something": 1,
    " You know, so I would roll, I'd make no eye contact, you know, just kind of frown, right?": 1,
    "Or I'd dress up really, really sharply or something, or I'd make eye contact with everyone, you know, that was really creepy, that didn't work at all.": 1,
    " I know.": 1,
    " You know, anything I tried, I wouldn't shower for a week.": 1,
    "Nothing worked.": 1,
    " Nothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago my six-year-old daughters were going to this wheelchair Catalog that I had and they said oh dad dad look you got to get these these flashy wheels you got to get them and I said oh": 1,
    " Girls, dad is a very important journalist.": 1,
    "That just wouldn't do at all.": 1,
    "And of course, they immediately concluded, oh, what a bummer, dad.": 1,
    "Journalists aren't allowed to have flashy wheels.": 1,
    "I mean, how important could you be then?": 1,
    " They said.": 1,
    " I went, wait a minute, all right, right.": 1,
    "I'll get the wheels purely out of protest.": 1,
    "I got the flashy wheels and I installed them.": 1,
    "And check this out.": 1,
    "Could I have my special light cube, please?": 1,
    " Look at that.": 1,
    "Now, look at this, look at this.": 1,
    " So what you are looking at here has completely changed my life.": 1,
    "I mean, totally changed my life.": 1,
    "Instead of blank stares and awkwardness, now it is": 1,
    " pointing and smiling.": 1,
    "People going, awesome wheels, dude, those are awesome.": 1,
    "I mean, I want some of those wheels.": 1,
    "Little kids say, can I have a ride?": 1,
    " And of course, there's the occasional person, usually a middle-aged male, who will say, oh, those wheels are great.": 1,
    "I guess they're for safety, right?": 1,
    " No, they're not for safety.": 1,
    " What's the difference here?": 1,
    "The wheelchair with no lights and the wheelchair with lights.": 1,
    "The difference is intent.": 1,
    "I'm no longer a victim.": 1,
    " I chose to change the situation.": 1,
    "I'm the commander of the starship wheelchair with the phaser wheels in the front, right?": 1,
    "Intent changes the picture completely.": 1,
    " I choose to enhance this rolling experience with a simple design element.": 1,
    " Acting with intent.": 1,
    "It conveys authorship.": 1,
    "It suggests that someone is driving.": 1,
    " It's reassuring, people are drawn to it.": 1,
    "Someone making the experience their own, covering the tragic tune with something different, something radically different.": 1,
    " people respond to that.": 1,
    "Now it seems simple, but actually I think in our society and culture in general, we have a huge problem with intent.": 1,
    "Now go with me here.": 1,
    " Look at this guy.": 1,
    "You know who this is?": 1,
    "Anders Breivik.": 1,
    "Now, if he intended to kill, in Oslo, Norway last year, dozens and dozens of young people, if he intended to do that,": 1,
    " He's a vicious criminal.": 1,
    "We punish him.": 1,
    "Life in prison, death penalty in the United States, not so much in Norway.": 1,
    "But if he instead acted out of a delusional fantasy,": 1,
    " If he was motivated by some random mental illness, he's in a completely different category.": 1,
    "We may put him away for life, but we watch him, clinically.": 1,
    " It's a completely different domain.": 1,
    "As an intentional murderer, Anders Brevik is merely evil, but as a dysfunctional murderous psychotic, he's something much more complicated.": 1,
    "He's the breath.": 1,
    " of some primitive, ancient chaos.": 1,
    "He's the random state of nature we emerged from.": 1,
    " He's something very, very different.": 1,
    "It's as though intent is an essential component for humanity.": 1,
    "It's what we're supposed to do somehow.": 1,
    "We're supposed to act with intent.": 1,
    "We're supposed to do things by design.": 1,
    "Intent": 1,
    " is a marker for civilization.": 1,
    "Now here's an example closer to home.": 1,
    "My family is all about intent.": 1,
    " You can probably tell they're two sets of twins, the result of IVF technology and vitro fertilization technology due to some physical limitations I won't go into.": 1,
    " Anyway, in vitro technology, IVF, is about as intentional as agriculture.": 1,
    "Let me tell you, some of you may have the experience.": 1,
    " In fact, the whole technology of sperm extraction for spinal cord injured males was invented by a veterinarian.": 1,
    " I met the dude.": 1,
    "He's a great guy, carried this big leather bag full of sperm probes for all of the animals that he'd worked with.": 1,
    " all the different animals, probes he designed.": 1,
    "And in fact, he was really, really proud of these probes.": 1,
    "He would say, you're right between horse and squirrel, John.": 1,
    " But anyway, so when my wife and I decided to upgrade our early middle age, we had four kids after all, with a little different technology that I won't explain in too much detail here, my urologist assured me": 1,
    " I had nothing whatsoever to worry about.": 1,
    "No need for birth control, Doc.": 1,
    "Are you sure about that?": 1,
    " I looked at your chart.": 1,
    "From your sperm tests, we can confidently say that you are basically a form of birth control.": 1,
    " What a liberating thought.": 1,
    "Yes.": 1,
    "And after a couple of very liberating weekends, my wife and I, utilizing some cutting-edge erectile technology that is certainly worthy of a TED Talk someday, but": 1,
    " I won't get into it now.": 1,
    "We noticed some familiar, if unexpected, symptoms.": 1,
    "I wasn't exactly a form of birth control.": 1,
    " Look at that font there.": 1,
    "My wife was so pissed.": 1,
    "I mean, did a designer come up with that?": 1,
    "No, I don't think a designer did come up with that.": 1,
    "In fact, maybe that's the problem.": 1,
    "And so little Ajax was born.": 1,
    " He's like our other children, but the experience is completely different.": 1,
    " It's something like my accident, right?": 1,
    "He came out of nowhere.": 1,
    "But we all had to change, but not just react to the given, we bend to this new experience with intent.": 1,
    " We're five now.": 1,
    " Five.": 1,
    "Facing the given with intent.": 1,
    "Doing things by design.": 1,
    "Hey, the name Ajax.": 1,
    "Can't get much more intentional than that, right?": 1,
    "We're really hoping he thanks us for that later on.": 1,
    " But I never became a designer.": 1,
    "No, no, no, no, never tempted, never even close.": 1,
    "I did love some great designs as I was growing up.": 1,
    "The HP 35 S calculator.": 1,
    "God, I love that thing.": 1,
    "Oh God, I wish I had one.": 1,
    " Man, I love that thing.": 1,
    "I could afford that.": 1,
    "Other designs I really couldn't afford like the 1974 911 Targa.": 1,
    " In school, I studied nothing close to designer engineering.": 1,
    "I studied useless things like the classics.": 1,
    "But there were some lessons even there.": 1,
    "This guy, Plato, turns out he's a designer.": 1,
    " He designed a state in the Republic, a design never implemented.": 1,
    "Listen to one of the design features of Plato's Government 4.0.": 1,
    " The state in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed, and the state in which they are most eager the worst.": 1,
    "Well, got that wrong, didn't we?": 1,
    " But look at that statement.": 1,
    "It's all about intent.": 1,
    "That's what I love about it.": 1,
    "But consider what Plato is doing here.": 1,
    "What is he doing?": 1,
    "It's a grand idea of design, a huge idea of design.": 1,
    " common to all of the voices of religion and philosophy that emerged in the classical period.": 1,
    "What was going on then?": 1,
    " They were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive as the human race emerged from a prehistoric chaos, a confrontation with random, brutal,": 1,
    " Nature.": 1,
    "They suddenly had a moment to think and there was a lot to think about.": 1,
    "All of a sudden, human existence needed an intent.": 1,
    " Human life needed a reason.": 1,
    "Reality itself needed a designer.": 1,
    "The given was replaced by various aspects of intent, by various designs, by various gods.": 1,
    " God's we're still fighting about.": 1,
    "Oh yeah.": 1,
    " Today we don't confront the chaos of nature.": 1,
    "Today it is the chaos of humanity's impact on the earth itself that we confront.": 1,
    "This young discipline called design, I think,": 1,
    " is in fact the emerging ethos, formulating and then answering a very new question.": 1,
    "What shall we do now in the face of the chaos that we have created?": 1,
    "What shall we do?": 1,
    " How shall we inscribe intent on all the objects we create, on all the circumstances we create, on all the places we change, the consequences of a planet with seven billion people and counting?": 1,
    " That's the tune we're all covering today, all of us.": 1,
    "And we can't just imitate the past, no.": 1,
    " That won't do.": 1,
    " That won't do it all.": 1,
    " Here's my favorite design moment.": 1,
    "In the city of Kinshasa in Zaire in the 1990s, I was working for ABC News and I was reporting on the fall of Mobutu Sese Seku, the dictator, the brutal dictator in Zaire who raped and pillaged that country.": 1,
    " rioting in the middle of Kinshasa.": 1,
    "The place was falling apart.": 1,
    "It was a horrible, horrible place.": 1,
    "And I needed to go and explore the center of Kinshasa to report on the rioting and the looting.": 1,
    "People were": 1,
    " Carrying off vehicles, carrying off pieces of buildings, soldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and hurting some in mass arrests.": 1,
    "In the middle of this chaos, I'm rolling around in a wheelchair and I was completely invisible.": 1,
    " Completely.": 1,
    "I was in a wheelchair.": 1,
    "Didn't look like a looter.": 1,
    " I was in a wheelchair, didn't look like a journalist particularly, at least from their perspective, and I didn't look like a soldier, that's for sure.": 1,
    " I was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of Zaire, completely invisible.": 1,
    "And all of a sudden from around a corner comes this young man paralyzed just like me in this metal and wood and leather": 1,
    " pedal, three wheel, tricycle, wheelchair device, and he pedals up to me as fast as he can.": 1,
    "He goes, hey mister, mister!": 1,
    " And I looked at him.": 1,
    "He didn't know any other English than that, but we didn't need English.": 1,
    " We sat there and compared wheels and tires and spokes and tubes.": 1,
    " And I looked at his wacky pedal mechanism.": 1,
    "He was full of pride over his design.": 1,
    "I wish I could show you that contraption.": 1,
    "His smile, our glow, as we talked a universal language.": 1,
    " of design.": 1,
    " Invisible to the chaos around us.": 1,
    "His machine, homemade, bolted, rusty, comical.": 1,
    "My machine, American-made, confident, sleek.": 1,
    " He was particularly proud of the comfortable seat, really comfortable seat he had made in his chariot and its beautiful fabric fringe around the edge.": 1,
    "Oh, I wish I'd had those sparkly wheels back then to have shown him.": 1,
    "Man, he would have loved those.": 1,
    " Oh yeah, he would have understood those.": 1,
    "A chariot of pure intent, think about it, in a city out of control.": 1,
    "Design blew it all away for a moment.": 1,
    " We spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos.": 1,
    "He went back to the streets of Kinshasa.": 1,
    "I went to my hotel and I think of him now.": 1,
    " And I pose this question.": 1,
    " An object imbued with intent.": 1,
    "It has power.": 1,
    "It's treasure.": 1,
    "We're drawn to it.": 1,
    " An object devoid of intent?": 1,
    "It's random.": 1,
    "It's imitative.": 1,
    " It repels us.": 1,
    "It's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away.": 1,
    "This is what we must demand of our lives, of our objects, of our things, of our circumstances, living with intent.": 1,
    " And I have to say that on that score I have a very unfair advantage over all of you.": 1,
    "And I want to explain it to you now because this is a very special day.": 1,
    " 36 years ago, at nearly this moment.": 1,
    " A 19 year old boy awoke from a coma to ask a nurse a question.": 1,
    "But the nurse was already there with an answer.": 1,
    "You've had a terrible accident young man.": 1,
    "You've broken your back.": 1,
    "You'll never walk again.": 1,
    " I said, I know all that.": 1,
    "What day is it?": 1,
    " You see, I knew that the car had gone over the guardrail on the 28th of February, and I knew that 1976 was a leap year.": 1,
    " Nurse, is this the 28th or the 29th?": 1,
    "And she looked at me and said,": 1,
    " It's March 1st.": 1,
    " And I went, oh my God.": 1,
    " I've got some catching up to do.": 1,
    "And from that moment, I knew": 1,
    " The given was that accident.": 1,
    "I had no option.": 1,
    " but to make up this new life without walking.": 1,
    "Intent, a life with intent, lived by design, covering the original with something better.": 1,
    " It's something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times.": 1,
    " to get back to this, to get back to design.": 1,
    " And as my daddy suggested a long time ago, make the song your own, John.": 1,
    " Show everybody what you intend.": 1,
    " Daddy, this one's for you.": 1,
    " Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner But he was another man": 1,
    " Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona to attend a California bash.": 1,
    "Get back to where you once belonged.": 1,
    " Get back get back to where you once be": 1
