    " We invent.": 1,
    "My company invents all kinds of new technology in lots of different areas.": 1,
    "And we do that for a couple of reasons.": 1,
    " we invent for fun.": 1,
    "Invention is a lot of fun to do, and we also invent for profit.": 1,
    "The two are related because the profit actually takes long enough that isn't fun, you wouldn't have the time to do it.": 1,
    " So we do this fun and profit-oriented inventing for most of what we do, but we also have a program where we invent for humanity.": 1,
    " We take some of our best inventors and we say, are there problems where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has?": 1,
    "And to solve it in the way we try to solve problems, which is with dramatic, crazy, out-of-the-box solutions.": 1,
    " Bill Gates is one of those smartest guys of ours that work on these problems, and he also funds this work, so thank you.": 1,
    " So I'm going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we've got some solutions underway.": 1,
    " Vaccination is one of the key techniques in public health, a fantastic thing, but in the developing world, a lot of vaccines spoil before they're administered.": 1,
    " And that's because they need to be kept cold.": 1,
    "Almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures.": 1,
    "They go bad very quickly if you don't.": 1,
    "And if you don't have a stable power grid, this doesn't happen.": 1,
    "So kids die.": 1,
    " It's not just the loss of the vaccine that matters, it's the fact that those kids don't get vaccinated.": 1,
    " This is one of the ways that vaccines are carried.": 1,
    "These are styrofoam chests.": 1,
    "These are being carried by people, but they're also put in the backs of pickup trucks.": 1,
    "We've got a different solution.": 1,
    " Now, one of these styrofoam chests will last for about four hours with ice in it.": 1,
    "And we thought, well, that's not really good enough.": 1,
    "So we made this thing.": 1,
    "This lasts six months with no power.": 1,
    " Absolutely zero power because it loses less than a half a watt.": 1,
    " Now this is our second generation prototype.": 1,
    "The third generation prototype is right now in Uganda being tested.": 1,
    " Now, the reason we were able to come up with this is two key ideas.": 1,
    "One is that this is similar to a cryogenic doer, something you'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in.": 1,
    "They have incredible insulation, so let's put some incredible insulation here.": 1,
    " The other idea is kind of interesting, which is you can't reach inside anymore.": 1,
    "Because if you open it up and reach inside, you let the heat in, the game would be over.": 1,
    "So the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine.": 1,
    " It vends out little individual vials.": 1,
    "So a simple idea, which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed in Africa and around the world.": 1,
    " We'll move on to malaria.": 1,
    "Malaria is one of the great public health problems.": 1,
    "Esther Duflo talked a little bit about this.": 1,
    "250 million people a year.": 1,
    "Every 43 seconds, a child in Africa dies.": 1,
    " 27 will die during my talk.": 1,
    " And there's no way for us here in this country to grasp really what that means to the people involved.": 1,
    "Another comment of Esther's was that we react when there's a tragedy like Haiti, but that tragedy is ongoing.": 1,
    " So what can we do about it?": 1,
    " Well, there's a lot of things people have tried for many years for solving malaria.": 1,
    "You can spray.": 1,
    "The problem is there's environmental issues.": 1,
    "You can try to treat people and create awareness.": 1,
    "That's great, except the places that have malaria really bad, they don't have health care systems.": 1,
    " A vaccine would be a terrific thing, only they don't work yet.": 1,
    "People have tried for a long time.": 1,
    "There's a couple of interesting candidates.": 1,
    "It's a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for.": 1,
    " you can distribute bed nets.": 1,
    "And bed nets are very effective if you use them.": 1,
    "You don't always use them for that.": 1,
    "People fish with them.": 1,
    "They don't always get to everyone.": 1,
    " And bed nets have an effect on the epidemic, but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets.": 1,
    " Now, malaria is an incredibly complicated disease.": 1,
    "We could spend hours going over this.": 1,
    "It's got this sort of soap opera-like lifestyle.": 1,
    "They have sex, they burrow into your liver, they tunnel into your blood cells.": 1,
    " It's an incredibly complicated disease, but that's actually one of the things we find interesting about it and why we work on malaria.": 1,
    "There's a lot of potential ways in.": 1,
    " One of those ways might be better diagnosis.": 1,
    "So we hope this year to prototype each of these devices.": 1,
    " One does an automatic malaria diagnosis in the same way that a diabetic's glucose meter works.": 1,
    "You take a drop of blood, you put it in there, and it automatically tells you.": 1,
    "Today, you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure": 1,
    " create a bunch of microscope slides, and have a trained person examine it.": 1,
    " The other thing, you know, it'd be even better if you didn't have to draw the blood.": 1,
    "And if you look through the eye or if you look at the vessels on the white of the eye,": 1,
    " In fact, you may be able to do this directly without drawing any blood at all, or through your nail beds.": 1,
    "Because if you actually look through your fingernails, you can see blood vessels.": 1,
    "And once you see the blood vessels, we think we can see the malaria.": 1,
    " We can see it because of this molecule called hemazoin.": 1,
    " It's produced by the malaria parasite, and it's a very interesting crystalline substance.": 1,
    "Interesting anyway if you're a solid-state physicist, there's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it.": 1,
    " This is our femtosecond laser lab.": 1,
    " So this creates pulses of light, the last femtosecond, that's really, really, really short.": 1,
    "This is a pulse of light that's only about one wavelength of light long, so it's a whole bunch of photons all coming and hitting simultaneously.": 1,
    " It creates a very high peak power, and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things.": 1,
    "In particular, it lets you find haemazoids.": 1,
    "So here's an image of red blood cells, and now we can actually map": 1,
    " where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are inside those red blood cells.": 1,
    "And using both this technique and other optical techniques, we think we can make those diagnostics.": 1,
    " We also have another hemozoin-oriented therapy for malaria, a way in acute cases to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system, sort of like doing dialysis, but for relieving the parasite load.": 1,
    " This is our thousand core supercomputer we're kind of software guys and so nearly any problem that you pose we like to try to solve with some software.": 1,
    " One of the problems that you have if you're trying to eradicate malaria or reduce it is you don't know what's the most effective thing to do.": 1,
    "We heard about bed nets earlier.": 1,
    "You spend a certain amount per bed net.": 1,
    " where you could spray, you can give drug administration.": 1,
    "There's all these different interventions, but they have different kinds of effectiveness.": 1,
    " How can you tell?": 1,
    "So we've created, using our supercomputer, the world's best computer model of malaria, which we'll show you now.": 1,
    " We picked Madagascar.": 1,
    "We have every road, every village, every almost square inch of Madagascar.": 1,
    "We have all of the precipitation data.": 1,
    " and the temperature data.": 1,
    "That's very important because the humidity and precipitation tell you whether you've got standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed.": 1,
    " So that sets the stage on which you do this.": 1,
    "You then have to introduce the mosquitoes, and you have to model that and how they come and go.": 1,
    "Ultimately, it gives you this.": 1,
    "This is malaria spreading across Madagascar.": 1,
    " And this is the latter part of the rainy season.": 1,
    "We're going to the dry season now.": 1,
    "It nearly goes away in the dry season because there's no place for the mosquitoes to breed.": 1,
    "And then, of course, the next year it comes roaring back.": 1,
    " By doing these kinds of simulations, we want to eradicate or control malaria thousands of times in software before we actually have to do it in real life.": 1,
    " to be able to simulate both the economic trade-offs, how many bed nets for so much spraying, or the social trade-offs, what happens if unrest breaks out?": 1,
    " We also try to study our foe.": 1,
    "This is a high-speed camera view of a mosquito.": 1,
    " And in a moment, we're going to see a view of the airflow.": 1,
    "Here we're trying to visualize the airflow around the wings of the mosquito.": 1,
    "We have little particles, and we're illuminating with a laser.": 1,
    " By understanding how mosquitoes fly, we hope to understand how to make them not fly.": 1,
    "Now, one of the ways you can make them not fly is with DDT.": 1,
    "This is a real ad.": 1,
    "This is one of those things you just can't make up.": 1,
    " Once upon a time, this was the primary technique, and in fact, many countries got rid of malaria through DDT.": 1,
    "The United States did.": 1,
    "1935, there were 150,000 cases a year of malaria in the United States.": 1,
    " But DDT and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it.": 1,
    " So we thought, well, we need to control, we've got all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium, the parasite involved.": 1,
    "What can we do to the mosquito?": 1,
    "Well, let's try to kill it with consumer electronics.": 1,
    " Now, that sounds silly, but each of these devices has something interesting in it that maybe you could use.": 1,
    "Your Blu-ray player has a very cheap blue laser.": 1,
    " Your laser printer has a mirror galvanometer that's used to steer a laser beam very accurately.": 1,
    "That's what makes those little dots on the page.": 1,
    "And, of course, there's signal processing and digital cameras.": 1,
    "So what if we could put all that together?": 1,
    " to shoot them out of the sky with lasers.": 1,
    " Yep.": 1,
    " This is, in our company, this is what we call the pinky suck moment.": 1,
    " What if we could do that?": 1,
    "Now just suspend disbelief for a moment, and let's think of what could happen if we could do that.": 1,
    " Well, we could protect very high-value targets like clinics.": 1,
    "Clinics are full of people that have malaria.": 1,
    "They're sick, and so they're less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes.": 1,
    "You really want to protect them.": 1,
    "Of course, if you do that, you could also protect your backyard.": 1,
    " And farmers can protect their crops that they want to sell to Whole Foods because our photons are 100% organic.": 1,
    "They're completely natural.": 1,
    " Now, it actually gets better than this.": 1,
    "You could, if you're really smart, you could shine a non-lethal laser on the bug before you zap it.": 1,
    "And you could listen to the wing beat frequency.": 1,
    " And you could measure the size.": 1,
    "And then you could decide, is this an insect I want to kill or an insect I don't want to kill?": 1,
    "Moore's law made computing cheap so cheap we can weigh the life of an individual insect.": 1,
    " and decide thumbs up or thumbs down.": 1,
    " Now, it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes.": 1,
    "They're the only ones that are dangerous.": 1,
    "Mosquitoes only drink blood to lay eggs.": 1,
    " The seeds actually live, their day-to-day nutrition comes from nectar, from flowers.": 1,
    "In fact, in the lab, we feed ours raisins.": 1,
    "But the female needs the blood meal.": 1,
    "So, this sounds really crazy, right?": 1,
    " Would you like to see it?": 1,
    " Okay, so our legal department prepared a disclaimer, and here it is.": 1,
    " Now, after thinking about this a little bit, we thought, you know, it probably would be simpler to do this with a non-lethal laser.": 1,
    "So Eric Johansson, who built the device actually with parts from eBay,": 1,
    " And Pablo Holman over here, he's got mosquitoes in the tank.": 1,
    "We have the device over here and we're going to show you": 1,
    " where instead of the kill laser, which would be a very brief instantaneous pulse, we're going to have a green laser pointer that's going to stay on the mosquito for actually quite a long period of time.": 1,
    "Otherwise, you can't see it very well.": 1,
    "Take it away, Eric.": 1,
    " What we have here is a tank on the other side of the stage, and we have this computer screen can actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around.": 1,
    "And Pablo stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit.": 1,
    " we can see them flying around.": 1,
    "Now that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine, and let me show you how it works.": 1,
    "Here you can see that the insects are being tracked as they're flying around, which is kind of fun.": 1,
    " Next we actually can light them up with a laser.": 1,
    "So now this is a low power laser and we can actually pick up our wing beat frequency.": 1,
    "So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around.": 1,
    "That's a mosquito wing beat you're hearing.": 1,
    " Well, finally, let's see what this looks like.": 1,
    " There you can see mosquitoes as they fly around being lit up.": 1,
    "This is being slowed way down so that you have an opportunity to see what's happening.": 1,
    "Here we have it running in high-speed mode.": 1,
    "So this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate": 1,
    " that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this.": 1,
    "And we're looking very hard at how to make it highly cost effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world.": 1,
    " So it wouldn't be any fun to show you that without showing you what actually happens when we hit them.": 1,
    " This is very satisfying.": 1,
    " This is one of the first ones he did.": 1,
    "The energy's a little bit high here.": 1,
    " Loop around here in just a second.": 1,
    "You'll see another one.": 1,
    "Here's another one bang an interesting thing is": 1,
    " We kill them all the time.": 1,
    "We've never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair.": 1,
    "The wing motor is very resilient.": 1,
    "Here we're blowing wings off, but the wing motor keeps all the way down.": 1,
    " So that's what I have.": 1,
    "Thanks very much.": 1
