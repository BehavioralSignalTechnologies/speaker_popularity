    " If you go on the TED website, you can currently find there over a full week of TED Talk videos, over 1.3 million words of transcripts and millions of user ratings.": 1,
    " And that's a huge amount of data.": 1,
    "And it got me wondering, if you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis, could you reverse engineer a TED talk?": 1,
    "Could you create the ultimate TED talk?": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " Also, could you create the worst possible TED Talk that they would still let you get away with?": 1,
    "To find this out, I looked at three things.": 1,
    "I looked at the topic that you should choose.": 1,
    "I looked at how you should deliver it and the visuals on stage.": 1,
    " Now, with a topic, there's a whole range of topics you can choose, but you should choose wisely because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk.": 1,
    " Now, to make this more concrete, let's look at the list of top 10 words that statistically stick out in the most favorite TED Talks and in the least favorite TED Talks.": 1,
    " So, if you came here to talk about how French coffee will spread happiness in our brains, that's a go!": 1,
    " Whereas if you wanted to talk about your project involving oxygen girls aircraft Actually, I would like to hear that talk but statistics say it's not so good": 1,
    " Oh, well, if you generalize this, the most favorite TED Talks are those that feature topics we can connect with both easily and deeply such as happiness, our own body, food, emotions.": 1,
    " And the more technical topics such as architecture, materials, and strangely enough, men, those are not good topics to talk about.": 1,
    " How should you deliver your talk?": 1,
    "Ted is famous for keeping a very sharp eye on the clock, so they're going to hate me for revealing this because, actually, you should talk as long as they will let you because the...": 1,
    " Most favorite TED Talks are on average over 50% longer than the least favorite ones.": 1,
    " And this holds true for all ranking lists on Ted.com, except if you want to have a talk that's beautiful, inspiring, or funny.": 1,
    "Then you should be brief.": 1,
    "But other than that, talk until they drag you off the stage.": 1,
    " Now...": 1,
    " while": 1,
    " While you're pushing the clock, there's a few rules to obey.": 1,
    "I found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four word phrases that appear more often in the most favorite TED Talks as opposed to the least favorite TED Talks.": 1,
    " I'll give you three examples.": 1,
    "First of all, I must as a speaker provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you instead of saying what I can't have.": 1,
    "Secondly, it's imperative that you do not cite the New York Times.": 1,
    " And finally, it's OK for the speaker.": 1,
    "That's a good news to fake intellectual capacity.": 1,
    "If I don't understand something, I can just say, et cetera, et cetera.": 1,
    "You'll all stay with me.": 1,
    "It's perfectly fine.": 1,
    " Now, let's go to the visuals.": 1,
    "The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker.": 1,
    "And analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite TED speakers, you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average.": 1,
    " Make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed up than the average TED speaker.": 1,
    " Slides are okay, though you might consider going for props, and now the most important thing.": 1,
    "That is the mood on stage.": 1,
    "Color plays a very important role.": 1,
    "Color closely correlates with the ratings that talks get on the website.": 1,
    " For example, fascinating talks contain a statistically high amount of exactly this blue color, much more than the average TED talk.": 1,
    "Ingenious TED talks, much more of this green color, et cetera, et cetera.": 1,
    " Now, personally, I think I'm not the first one who has done this analysis, but I'll leave this to your...": 1,
    " Good judgment.": 1,
    "So now it's time to put it all together and design the ultimate TED talk.": 1,
    "Now, since this is TED active and I learned from my analysis that I should actually give you something, I will not impose the ultimate or worst TED talk on you.": 1,
    " but rather give you a tool to create your own.": 1,
    "And I call this tool the Tetpad.": 1,
    " The Ted pad is a matrix of 100 specifically selected highly curated sentences that you can easily piece together to get your own Ted talk.": 1,
    " You only have to make one decision, and that is are you going to use the white version for very good TED Talks about creativity, human genius.": 1,
    " Or are you going to go with a black version, which will allow you to create really bad TED Talks, mostly about blogs, politics, and stuff.": 1,
    " Download it and have fun with it.": 1,
    "Now, I hope you enjoy the session.": 1,
    "I hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible TED Talks.": 1,
    "And I hope some of you will be inspired for next year to create this, which I really want to see.": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1
