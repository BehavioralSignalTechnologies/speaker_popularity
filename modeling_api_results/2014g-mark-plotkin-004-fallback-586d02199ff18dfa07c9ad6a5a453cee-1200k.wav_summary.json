    " Now, I'm an ethnobotanist.": 1,
    "That's a scientist who works in the rainforest to document how people use local plants.": 1,
    "I've been doing this for a long time.": 1,
    " And I want to tell you, these people know these forests and these medicinal treasures better than we do and better than we ever will.": 1,
    " But also, these cultures, these indigenous cultures, are disappearing much faster than the forest themselves.": 1,
    " And the greatest and most endangered species in the Amazon rainforest is not the jaguar.": 1,
    "It's not the herpy eagle.": 1,
    "It's the isolated and uncontacted tribes.": 1,
    "Now, four years ago, I injured my foot in a climbing accident.": 1,
    " and I went to the doctor.": 1,
    "She gave me heat, she gave me cold, aspirin, narcotic painkillers, anti-inflammatories, cortisone shots.": 1,
    "Didn't work.": 1,
    " Several months later, I was in the Northeast Amazon.": 1,
    " walked into a village, and the shaman said, you're limping.": 1,
    "And I'll never forget this as long as I live.": 1,
    "He looked me in the face and he said, take off your shoe and give me your machete.": 1,
    " He walked over to a palm tree and carved off a fern, threw it in the fire, applied it to my foot, threw it in a pot of water, and had me drink the tea.": 1,
    "The pain disappeared for seven months.": 1,
    " When it came back, I went to see the shaman again.": 1,
    "He gave me the same treatment, and I've been cured for three years now.": 1,
    " Who would you rather be treated by?": 1,
    " No, make no mistake, Western medicine is the most successful system of healing ever devised, but plenty of holes in it.": 1,
    " Where's the cure for breast cancer?": 1,
    "Where's the cure for schizophrenia?": 1,
    "Where's the cure for acid reflux?": 1,
    "Where's the cure for insomnia?": 1,
    "The fact is that these people can sometimes, sometimes, sometimes cure things we cannot.": 1,
    " Here you see a medicine man in the Northeast Amazon treating Leishmaniasis, a really nasty protozoal disease that afflicts 12 million people around the world.": 1,
    "Western treatment are injections of antimony.": 1,
    "They're painful.": 1,
    "They're expensive.": 1,
    " and they're probably not good for your heart, it's a heavy metal.": 1,
    "This man cures it with three plants from the Amazon rainforest.": 1,
    "This is the magic frog.": 1,
    " My colleague, the late great Lauren McIntyre, discoverer of the source lake of the Amazon Laguna McIntyre and the Peruvian Andes, was lost on the Peru-Brazil border about 30 years ago.": 1,
    "He was rescued by a group of isolated Indians called the Matces.": 1,
    " they beckoned for him to follow them into the forest, which he did.": 1,
    "There they took out palm-leaf baskets.": 1,
    " There they took out these green monkey frogs.": 1,
    "These are big suckers, they're like this.": 1,
    "And they began licking them.": 1,
    "It turns out they're highly hallucinogenic.": 1,
    " McIntyre wrote about this and it was read by the editor of High Times Magazine.": 1,
    " You see that ethnobotanists have friends in all sorts of strange cultures.": 1,
    "This guy decided he would go down to the Amazon, give it a whirl, or give it a lick.": 1,
    "And he did.": 1,
    " And he wrote, my blood pressure went to the roof.": 1,
    "I lost full control of my bodily functions.": 1,
    "I passed out in a heap.": 1,
    "I woke up in a hammock six hours later.": 1,
    "Felt like God for two days.": 1,
    " An Italian chemist read this and said, I'm not really interested in the theological aspects of the green monkey frog.": 1,
    "What's this about the change in blood pressure?": 1,
    " Now, there's an Italian chemist who's working on a new treatment for high blood pressure based on peptides in the skin of the green monkey frog, and other scientists are looking at a cure for drug-resistant staph aureus.": 1,
    " How ironic if these isolated Indians and their magic frog proved to be one of the cures.": 1,
    "Here's an ayahuasca shaman in the northwest Amazon in the middle of a Yahweh ceremony.": 1,
    " I took them to Los Angeles to meet a foundation officer looking for support for monies to protect their culture.": 1,
    " This fellow looked at the medicine man and he said, you didn't go to medical school, did you?": 1,
    "The shaman said, no, I did not.": 1,
    "He said, well, then what can you know about healing?": 1,
    " The shaman looked at him.": 1,
    "He said, you know what?": 1,
    "If you have an infection, go to a doctor.": 1,
    "He said, but many human afflictions are diseases of the heart, the mind, and the spirit.": 1,
    "Western medicine can't touch those.": 1,
    "I cure them.": 1,
    " But all is not rosy in learning from nature about new medicines.": 1,
    "This is a viper from Brazil, the venom of which was studied at the Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo here.": 1,
    "It was later developed into ACE inhibitors.": 1,
    " This is a front-line treatment for hypertension.": 1,
    "Hypertension kills over 10 percent of all deaths on the planet every day.": 1,
    "This is a four-billion-dollar industry based on venom from a Brazilian snake, and the Brazilians did not get a nickel.": 1,
    " This is not an acceptable way of doing business.": 1,
    " The rainforest has been called the greatest expression of life on earth.": 1,
    "There's a saying in Suriname that I dearly love.": 1,
    "The rainforest hold answers to questions we have yet to ask.": 1,
    " But as you all know, it's rapidly disappearing here in Brazil, in the Amazon, around the world.": 1,
    "I took this picture from a small plane flying over the eastern border of the Xingu Indigenous Reserve in the state of Mato Grosso to the northwest of here.": 1,
    " The top half of the picture, you see where the Indians live.": 1,
    "The line through the middle is the eastern border of the reserve.": 1,
    "Top half Indians, bottom half white guys.": 1,
    " Top half wonder drugs, bottom half just a bunch of skinny ass cows.": 1,
    " Top F, carbon sequester in the forest where it belongs.": 1,
    "Bottom half, carbon in the atmosphere where it's driving climate change.": 1,
    "In fact, the number two cause of carbon being released into the atmosphere": 1,
    " is forest destruction.": 1,
    " But in talking about destruction, it's important to keep in mind that the Amazon is the mightiest landscape of all.": 1,
    "It's a place of beauty and wonder.": 1,
    " The biggest ant eater in the world lives in the rainforest, tips a scale at 90 pounds.": 1,
    "The Goliath bird-eating spider is the world's largest spider.": 1,
    "It's found in the Amazon as well.": 1,
    " The harpy eagle wingspan is over seven feet and the black caiman.": 1,
    "These monsters can tip the scale at over half a ton.": 1,
    "They're known to be man eaters.": 1,
    " The anaconda, the largest snake, the capybara, the largest rodent.": 1,
    "A specimen from here in Brazil tipped the scale at 201 pounds.": 1,
    " But let's visit where these creatures live.": 1,
    "The Northeast Amazon, home to the Aquario tribe.": 1,
    "Uncontacted peoples.": 1,
    " hold a mystical and iconic role in our imagination.": 1,
    "These are the people who know nature best.": 1,
    "These are the people who truly live in total harmony with nature.": 1,
    " By our standards, some would dismiss these people as primitive.": 1,
    "They don't know how to make fire.": 1,
    "They didn't when they were first contacted.": 1,
    "But they know the forest far better than we do.": 1,
    " The Aquarios have 35 words for honey, and other Indians look up to them as being the true masters of the Armored Realm.": 1,
    " Here you see the face of my friend Pone.": 1,
    "When I was a teenager rocking out to the Rolling Stones in my hometown of New Orleans, Pone was a forest nomad roaming the jungles of the Northeast Amazon in a small band.": 1,
    " looking for game, looking for medicinal plants, looking for a wife and other small nomadic bands.": 1,
    " But it's people like these that know things that we don't.": 1,
    "And they have lots of lessons to teach us.": 1,
    " However, if you go into most of the forests of the Amazon, there are no indigenous peoples.": 1,
    "This is what you find.": 1,
    "Rock.": 1,
    " carvings, which indigenous peoples, uncontacted peoples, used to sharpen the edge of the stone axe.": 1,
    "These cultures that once danced": 1,
    " made love, sang to the gods, worshiped the forest.": 1,
    "All that's left is an imprint in stone, as you see here.": 1,
    " But let's move to the Western Amazon, which is really the epicenter of isolated peoples.": 1,
    "Each of these dots represents a small, uncontacted tribe.": 1,
    "And the big reveal today": 1,
    " is we believe there are 14 or 15 isolated groups in the Colombian Amazon alone.": 1,
    " Why are these people isolated?": 1,
    "They know we exist.": 1,
    "They know there's an outside world.": 1,
    "This is a form of resistance.": 1,
    "They have chosen to remain isolated, and I think it is their human right to remain so.": 1,
    " Why are these the tribes that hide from man?": 1,
    "Here's why.": 1,
    "Obviously, some of this was set off in 1492.": 1,
    " But at the turn of the last century was the rubber trade.": 1,
    "The demand for natural rubber, which came from the Amazon, set off the botanical equivalent of a gold rush.": 1,
    "Rubber for bicycle tires, rubber for automobile tires, rubber for zeppelins.": 1,
    " It was a mad race to get that rubber.": 1,
    "And the man on the left, Julio Errana, is one of the true thugs of the story.": 1,
    " that his people, his company, and other companies like them killed, massacred, tortured, butchered Indians like the Weetotos you see on the right-hand side of the slide.": 1,
    " Even today, when people come out of the forest, the story seldom has a happy ending.": 1,
    "These are new cocks.": 1,
    "They were contacted in the 80s.": 1,
    "Within a year, everybody over 40 was dead.": 1,
    " Remember, these are pre-literate societies.": 1,
    "The elders are the libraries.": 1,
    "Every time a shaman dies, it's as if a library has burned down.": 1,
    " They have been forced off their lands.": 1,
    "The drug traffickers have taken over the Nukoc lands.": 1,
    " And the Nukoks live as beggars in public parks in eastern Colombia.": 1,
    "From the Nukok lands, I want to take you to the southwest, to the most spectacular landscape in the world, Chitwikete National Park.": 1,
    " It was surrounded by three isolated tribes, and thanks to the Colombian government and Colombian colleagues, it has now expanded.": 1,
    "It's bigger than the state of Maryland.": 1,
    "It is a treasure trove of botanical diversity.": 1,
    " It was first explored botanically in 1943 by my mentor, Richard Schultes, seen here atop the Bell Mountain, the sacred mountains of the Carahonas.": 1,
    "And let me show you what it looks like today.": 1,
    " flying over Chiribiquete, realized that these lost world mountains are still lost.": 1,
    "No scientist has been atop them.": 1,
    "In fact, nobody's been atop the Bell Mountains since Schultes in 43.": 1,
    "And we'll end up here with the Bell Mountain": 1,
    " just to the east of the picture.": 1,
    "Let me show you what it looks like today.": 1,
    " Not only is this a treasure trove of botanical diversity, not only is it home to three isolated tribes, but it's the greatest treasure trove of pre-Columbian art in the world.": 1,
    "Over 200,000 paintings.": 1,
    " The Dutch scientist Thomas van der Hamen described this as the Sistine Chapel of the Amazon Rainforest.": 1,
    " But moving Chiribiquete down to the southeast, again in the Colombian Amazon.": 1,
    "Remember, the Colombian Amazon is bigger than New England.": 1,
    "The Amazon's a big forest.": 1,
    "Brazil's got a big part of it, but not all of it.": 1,
    "Moving down to these two national parks, Cauinari and Pura\u00ed,": 1,
    " in the Colombian Amazon, that's a Brazilian border to the right.": 1,
    " It's home to several groups of isolated and uncontacted peoples.": 1,
    "To the trained eye, you can look at the roofs of these malokas, these longhouses.": 1,
    " and see that there's cultural diversity.": 1,
    "These are, in fact, different tribes.": 1,
    "As isolated as these areas are, let me show you how the outside world is crowding in.": 1,
    " Here we see trade and transport increased in Putumayo.": 1,
    "With the diminishment of the Civil War in Colombia, the outside world is showing up.": 1,
    "To the north we have illegal gold mining.": 1,
    " also from the east from Brazil.": 1,
    "There's increased hunting and fishing for commercial purposes.": 1,
    "We see illegal logging coming from the south, and drug runners are trying to move through the park and get into Brazil.": 1,
    " This, in the past, is why you didn't mess with isolated Indians.": 1,
    "And if it looks like this picture's out of focus because it was taken in a hurry, here's why.": 1,
    " This looks like I have...": 1,
    " This looks like a hanger from the Brazilian Amazon.": 1,
    "This is an art exhibit in Havana, Cuba.": 1,
    "A group called Los Carpinteros.": 1,
    "This is their perception of why you shouldn't mess with uncontacted Indians.": 1,
    " but the world is changing.": 1,
    "These are masculpiros on the Brazil-Peru border who stumbled out of the jungle because they were essentially chased out by drug runners and timber people.": 1,
    " And in Peru, there's a very nasty business.": 1,
    "It's called human safaris.": 1,
    "They will take you in to isolated groups to take their picture.": 1,
    "Of course, when you give them clothes, when you give them tools, you also give them diseases.": 1,
    "We call these inhuman safaris.": 1,
    " These are Indians again on the Prue border who were overflown by flight sponsored by missionaries.": 1,
    "They want to get in there and turn them into Christians.": 1,
    "We know how that turns out.": 1,
    "What's to be done?": 1,
    " introduce technology to the contacted tribes, not the uncontacted tribes, in a culturally sensitive way.": 1,
    "This is the perfect marriage of ancient shamanic wisdom and 21st century technology.": 1,
    " We've done this now with over 30 tribes, mapped, managed, and increased protection of over 70 million acres of ancestral rainforest.": 1,
    " So this allows the Indians to take control of their environmental and cultural destiny.": 1,
    "They also then set up guard houses to keep outsiders out.": 1,
    " These are Indians trained as indigenous park rangers, patrolling the borders and keeping the outside world at bay.": 1,
    " This is a picture of actual contact.": 1,
    "These are Chitanawa Indians on the Brazil-Peru border.": 1,
    "They've come out of the jungle asking for help.": 1,
    "They were shot at.": 1,
    "Their malokas, their longhouses were burned.": 1,
    " Some of them were massacred.": 1,
    " using automatic weapons to slaughter uncontacted peoples is the single most despicable and disgusting human rights abuse on our planet today and it has to stop.": 1,
    " But let me conclude by saying this work can be spiritually rewarding, but it's difficult and it can be dangerous.": 1,
    "Two colleagues of mine passed away recently.": 1,
    " in the crash of a small plane.": 1,
    "They were serving the forest to protect those uncontacted tribes.": 1,
    "So the question is, in conclusion, is what the future holds.": 1,
    "These are the Uray people in Brazil.": 1,
    " What does the future hold for them and what does the future hold for us?": 1,
    " Let's think differently.": 1,
    "Let's make a better world.": 1,
    "If the climate's going to change, let's have a climate that changes for the better rather than the worse.": 1,
    " Let's live on a planet full of luxuriant vegetation in which isolated peoples can remain in isolation": 1,
    " can maintain that mystery and that knowledge if they so choose.": 1,
    "Let's live in a world where the shamans live in these forests.": 1,
    " and heal themselves and us with their mystical plants and their sacred frogs.": 1,
    "Thanks again.": 1
