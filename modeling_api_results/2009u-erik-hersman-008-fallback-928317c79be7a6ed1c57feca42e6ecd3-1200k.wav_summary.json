    " So I'm here to tell you a story of success from Africa.": 1,
    "A year and a half ago, four of the five people who are full-time members of Ushahidi, which means Testimonium Kiswahili,": 1,
    " We're Ted Fellows.": 1,
    " A year ago in Kenya we had post-election violence and in that time we prototyped and built in about three days a system that would allow anybody with a mobile phone to send in information and reports on what was happening around them.": 1,
    " We took what we knew about Africa, the default device, the mobile phone as our common denominator, and went from there.": 1,
    "We got reports like this.": 1,
    " This is just a couple of them from just January 17th last year.": 1,
    " And our system was rudimentary.": 1,
    "It was very basic.": 1,
    "It was a mashup that used data that we collected from people, and we put it on a map.": 1,
    " But then we decided we needed to do something more.": 1,
    "We needed to take what we had built and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world.": 1,
    "And so there's a team of developers from all over Africa who are part of this team now, from Ghana, from Malawi, from Kenya.": 1,
    " There's even some from the US.": 1,
    " We're building for smartphones so they can be used in the developed world as well as the developing world.": 1,
    "We're realizing that this is true.": 1,
    "If it works in Africa, then it will work anywhere.": 1,
    "And so we build for it in Africa first, and then we move to the edges.": 1,
    " It's now been deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.": 1,
    "It's being used by NGOs all over East Africa, small NGOs doing their own little projects.": 1,
    "And just this last month it was deployed by Al Jazeera in Gaza.": 1,
    " But that's actually not what I'm here to talk about.": 1,
    "I'm here to talk about the next big thing.": 1,
    "Because what we're finding out is that we have this capacity to report eyewitness accounts of what's going on in real time.": 1,
    "And we're seeing this in events like Mumbai recently.": 1,
    " where it's so much easier to report now than it is to consume it.": 1,
    "There's so much information, what do you do?": 1,
    "This is the Twitter reports for over three days just covering Mumbai.": 1,
    " How do you decide what is important?": 1,
    "What's the veracity level of what you're looking at?": 1,
    " So what we find is that there's this great deal of wasted crisis information, because there's just too much information for us to actually do anything with right now.": 1,
    " And what we're actually really concerned with is this first three hours.": 1,
    "What we're looking at is the first three hours of how do we deal with that information that's coming in that you can't understand what is actually happening.": 1,
    " And on the ground and around the world, people are still curious and trying to figure out what's going on, but they don't know.": 1,
    " So what we've built, of course, Ushahidi, is crowdsourcing this information.": 1,
    "And you see this with Twitter, too.": 1,
    "You get this information overload.": 1,
    "So you've got a lot of information.": 1,
    "That's great.": 1,
    "But now what?": 1,
    " So we think that there's something interesting we can do here.": 1,
    "And we have a small team who's working on this.": 1,
    "We think that we can actually create a crowdsourced filter.": 1,
    " take the crowd and apply them to the information.": 1,
    "And by rating it and rating the different people who submit information, we can get refined results and weighted results.": 1,
    " so that we have a better understanding of the probability of something being true or not.": 1,
    " This is a kind of innovation that is, quite frankly, it's interesting that it's coming from Africa.": 1,
    "It's coming from places that you wouldn't expect from young, smart developers.": 1,
    "And it's the community around it that has decided to build this.": 1,
    " So thank you very much, and we are very happy to be part of the TED family.": 1
