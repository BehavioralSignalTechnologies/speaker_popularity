    " In my industry, we believe that images can change the world.": 1,
    "Okay, we're naive, we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.": 1,
    "The truth is that we know that the images themselves don't change the world.": 1,
    "But we're also aware that since the beginning of photography,": 1,
    " images have provoked reactions in people, and those reactions have caused change to happen.": 1,
    "So let's begin with a group of images.": 1,
    " I'd be extremely surprised if you didn't recognize many or most of them.": 1,
    "They're best described as iconic.": 1,
    "So iconic, perhaps they're cliches.": 1,
    "In fact,": 1,
    " They're so well known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form.": 1,
    " But I think we're looking for something more.": 1,
    " We're looking for something more.": 1,

    " its smallness, its fragility.": 1,
    "Forty years later, this group, more than most, are well aware of the destructive power that our species can wield over our environment, and at last, we appear to be doing something about it.": 1,
    " This destructive power takes many different forms.": 1,
    "For example, these images taken by Brent Sturton in the Congo, these gorillas were murdered, some would even say crucified, and unsurprisingly, they sparked international outrage.": 1,
    " Most recently, we've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself with the recent earthquake in Haiti.": 1,
    "But I think that it's far worse": 1,
    " is man's destructive power over man.": 1,
    "Samuel Pizar, an Auschwitz survivor, said, and I'll quote him, the Holocaust teaches us": 1,
    " that nature, even in its cruelest moments, is benign in comparison with man when he loses his moral compass and his reason.": 1,
    " It has another kind of crucifixion.": 1,
    "The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib as well as the images from Guantanamo had a profound impact.": 1,
    " The publication of those images as opposed to the images themselves caused a government to change its policies.": 1,
    " Some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq than virtually any other single act.": 1,

    "A little girl burned by napalm.": 1,
    " a student killed by the National Guard at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest.": 1,
    "In fact, these images became the voices of protest themselves.": 1,
    "Now, images have power to shed light of understanding": 1,
    " on suspicion, ignorance, and in particular, I've given a lot of talks on this but I'll just show one image.": 1,
    " the issue of HIV AIDS.": 1,
    " In the 1980s, the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it.": 1,
    "A simple act in 1987 of the most famous woman in the world, the Princess of Wales, touching an HIV AIDS infected baby.": 1,
    " did a great deal, especially in Europe, to stop that.": 1,
    "She, better than most, knew the power of an image.": 1,
    "So when we are confronted by a powerful image, we all have a choice.": 1,
    "We can look away,": 1,
    " or we can address the image.": 1,
    "Thankfully, when these photos appeared in The Guardian in 1998, they put a lot of focus and attention and, in the end, a lot of money towards the Sudan famine relief efforts.": 1,
    "Did the images change the world?": 1,
    "No, but they had a major impact.": 1,
    " Images often push us to question our core beliefs and our responsibilities to each other.": 1,
    " We all saw those images after Katrina.": 1,
    "And I think for millions of people, they had a very strong impact.": 1,
    "And I think it's very unlikely that they were far from the minds of Americans when they went to vote in November 2008.": 1,
    " Unfortunately, some very important images are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them.": 1,
    " I'll show you one photo here.": 1,
    "It's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq war veteran from an extraordinary piece of work which has never been published called War is Personal.": 1,
