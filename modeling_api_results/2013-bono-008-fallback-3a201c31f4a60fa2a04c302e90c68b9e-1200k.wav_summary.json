    "Wow.": 2,
    " Chris Anderson asked me if I could put the last 25 years of anti-poverty campaigning into 10 minutes for Ted.": 1,
    "That's an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct.": 1,
    " I said, Chris, that would take a miracle.": 1,
    "He said, Bono, wouldn't that be a good use of your messianic complex?": 1,
    "So, yeah.": 1,
    " And I thought, let's go even further.": 1,
    "Let's go than 25 years.": 1,
    "Let's go back before Christ.": 1,
    " Three millennia to a time when, at least in my head, the journey for justice, the march against inequality and poverty really began.": 1,
    "Three thousand years ago, civilization just getting started on the banks of the Nile.": 1,
    " some slaves, Jewish shepherds in this instance, smelling of sheep shit, I guess, proclaim to the pharaoh, sitting high on his throne, we, your majestiness,": 1,
    " are equal to you.": 1,
    "And the Pharaoh replies, oh no, you, your miserableness have got to be kidding.": 1,
    "And they say,": 1,
    " No, no, that's what it says here in our holy book.": 1,
    "Cut to our century, same country, same pyramids and other people spreading the same idea of equality with a different book.": 1,
    "This time it's called the Facebook.": 1,
    " Crowds are gathered in Terrier Square.": 1,
    "They turn a social network from virtual to actual and kind of rebooted the 21st century.": 1,
    " Not to undersell how messy and ugly the aftermath of the Arab Spring has been, neither to oversell the role of technology, but these things have given a sense of what's possible when the age-old model of power, the pyramid,": 1,
    " It gets turned upside down, putting the people on top and the pharaohs of today on the bottom, as it were.": 1,
    "It's also shown us that something as powerful as information and the sharing of it": 1,
    " can challenge inequality, because facts like people want to be free, and when they're free, liberty is usually around the corner, even for the poorest of the poor.": 1,
    "Facts that can challenge cynicism and the apathy": 1,
    " that leads to inertia.": 1,
    "Facts that tell us what's working and more importantly what's not so we can fix it.": 1,
    "Facts that if we hear them and heed them could help us meet the challenge that Nelson Mandela made": 1,
    " back in 2005, when he asked us to be that great generation that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity, extreme poverty.": 1,
    "Facts that build a powerful momentum.": 1,
    " So I thought, forget the rock opera, forget the bombast.": 1,
    " my usual tricks.": 1,
    "The only thing singing today would be the facts, for I have truly embraced my inner nerd.": 1,
    " So exit the rock star.": 1,
    " Enter the evidence-based activist.": 1,
    " The Factivist.": 1,
    " Because what the facts are telling us.": 1,
    " is that the long, slow journey, humanity's long, slow journey of equality is actually speeding up.": 1,
    "Look at what's been achieved.": 1,
    "Look at the pictures these datasets print.": 1,
    " Since the year 2000, since the turn of the millennium, there are eight million more AIDS patients getting life-saving antiretroviral drugs.": 1,
    "Malaria.": 1,
    "There are eight countries in Sub-Saharan Africa that have their death rates cut by 75%.": 1,
    " For kids under five, child mortality, kids under five, it's down by 2.65 million a year.": 1,
    "That's a rate of 7,256 children's lives saved each day.": 1,
    " Wow.": 1,
    " Let's just stop for a second actually and think about that.": 1,
    "Have you read anything anywhere in the last week that is remotely as important as that number?": 1,
    "Great news.": 1,
    "It drives me nuts.": 1,
    " that most people don't seem to know this news.": 1,
    "7,000 kids a day.": 1,
    "Here's two of them.": 1,
    "This is Michael and Benedicta.": 1,
    " And they're alive, thanks in large part to Dr. Patricia Asamoah.": 1,
    "She's amazing.": 1,
    "And the Global Fund, which all of you financially support, whether you know it or not.": 1,
    " And the Global Fund provides antiretroviral drugs that stop mothers from passing HIV to their kids.": 1,
    " This fantastic news didn't happen by itself.": 1,
    "It was fought for, it was campaigned for, it was innovated for.": 1,
    "And this great news gives birth to even more great news.": 1,
    " because the historic trend is this.": 1,
    "The number of people living in back-breaking, soul-crushing extreme poverty has declined from 43% of the world's population in 1990": 1,
    " to 33% by 2000 and then to 21% by 2010.": 1,
    "Give it up for that.": 1,
    " Have have": 1,
    " Now.": 1,
    " The rate is still too high, still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives.": 1,
    "There's still work to do, but it's heart-stopping.": 1,
    " It's mind-blowing stuff.": 1,
    " And if you live...": 1,
    " on less than $1.25 a day.": 1,
    "If you live in that kind of poverty, this is not just data, this is everything.": 1,
    "If you're a parent who wants the best for your kids, and I am,": 1,
    " This rapid transition is a route out of despair and into hope.": 1,
    " And guess what?": 1,
    "If the trajectory continues, look where the amount of people living on $1.25 a day gets to by 2030.": 1,
    " Can't be true, can it?": 1,
    " That's what the data is telling us if the trajectory continues.": 1,
    "We get to, wow, the zero zone.": 1,
    "For number crunchers like us, that is the erogenous zone.": 1,
    " And it's fair to say that I am by now sexually aroused by the collating of data.": 1,
    " So virtual elimination of extreme poverty, as defined by people living on less than $1.25 a day, adjusted, of course, for inflation from a 1990 baseline.": 1,
    "We do live a good baseline.": 1,
    " That's amazing.": 1,
    " Now I know that some of you think this progress is all in Asia or Latin America or model countries like Brazil and who doesn't love a Brazilian model, but look at Sub-Saharan Africa.": 1,
    " As a collection of 10 countries, some call them the Lions, who in the last decade have had a combination of 100% debt cancellation,": 1,
    " a tripling of aid, a tenfold increase in FDI, that's foreign direct investment, which has unlocked a quadrupling of domestic resources, that's local money, which when spent wisely, that's good governance, cut childhood mortality by a third, doubled education completion rates,": 1,
    " And they too have extreme poverty.": 1,
    "And at this rate, these 10 get to zero too.": 1,
    "So the pride of lions is the proof of concept.": 1,
    " There are all kinds of benefits to this for a start.": 1,
    " you won't have to listen to an insufferable little jumped up Jesus like myself.": 1,
    "How about that?": 1,
    " And 2028, 2030, it's just around the corner.": 1,
    "I mean, it's about three Rolling Stones farewell concerts away.": 1,
    "I hope.": 1,
    "I'm hoping.": 1,
    " Makes us look really young.": 1,
    "So why aren't we jumping up and down about this?": 1,
    "Well,": 1,
    " The opportunity is real, but so is the jeopardy.": 1,
    "We can't get this done until we really accept that we can get this done.": 1,
    "Look at this graph.": 1,
    " It's called inertia.": 1,
    "It's how we screw it up.": 1,
    " And the next one is really beautiful.": 1,
    "It's called momentum.": 1,
    " And it's how we can bend the arc of history down towards zero, just doing the things that we know work.": 1,
    "So inertia versus momentum, there is jeopardy.": 1,
    " And of course, the closer you get, it gets harder.": 1,
    "We know the obstacles that are in our way right now in difficult times.": 1,
    "In fact, today, in your capital,": 1,
    " In difficult times, some who mine the nation's purse want to cut life-saving programs like the Global Fund.": 1,
    "But you can do something about that.": 1,
    "You can tell politicians that these cuts": 1,
    " can't cause lives.": 1,
    "Right now, today in Oslo as it happens, oil companies are fighting to keep secret their payments to governments for extracting oil in developing countries.": 1,
    " You can do something about that too.": 1,
    "You can join the One Campaign and leaders like Mo Ibrahim, the Telcom entrepreneur.": 1,
    " We're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some of the wealth under the ground Ends up in the hands of the people living above it and right now": 1,
    " We know that the biggest disease of all is not a disease.": 1,
    "It's corruption.": 1,
    "But there's a vaccine for that too.": 1,
    "It's called transparency.": 1,
    "Open data sets.": 1,
    " something the TED community is really on it.": 1,
    " Daylight, you could call it, transparency.": 1,
    "And technology is really turbocharging this.": 1,
    "It's getting harder to hide if you're doing bad stuff.": 1,
    " So let me tell you about the EU report.": 1,
    "I'm really excited about it.": 1,
    "It's 150,000 millennials all across Uganda, young people armed with 2G phones.": 1,
    " An SMS social network exposing government corruption and demanding to know what's in the budget and how their money is being spent.": 1,
    " This is exciting stuff.": 1,
    "Look, once you have these tools, you can't not use them.": 1,
    "Once you have this knowledge, you can't unknow it.": 1,
    "You can't delete this data from your brain, but you can delete.": 1,
    " the cliched image of supplicant, impoverished peoples not taking control of their own lives.": 1,
    "You can erase that.": 1,
    "You really can, because it's not true anymore.": 1,
    " It's transformational.": 1,
    "2030 by 2030 robots not just serving us Guinness but drinking it by the time we get there.": 1,
    " Every place with a rough semblance of governance might actually be on their way.": 1,
    " So I'm here to, I guess we're here to try and infect you with this virtuous database virus, the one we call factivism.": 1,
    " It's not going to kill you.": 1,
    "In fact, it could save countless lives.": 1,
    " I guess we in the one campaign would love you to be contagious, spread it, share it, pass it on.": 1,
    "By doing so, you will join us and countless others in what I truly believe": 1,
    " is the greatest adventure ever taken, the ever demanding journey of equality.": 1,
    "Could we really be the great generation?": 1,
    " that Mandela asked us to be, might we answer that clarion call with science, with reason, with facts, and dare I say it, emotions, because as is obvious,": 1,
    " Factivists have feelings too.": 1,
    " I'm thinking of Wael Gonen, though.": 1,
    "Some of you know him.": 1,
    "He set up one of the Facebook groups behind the Terrier Square in Cairo.": 1,
    " He got thrown in jail for it, but I have his words tattooed on my brain.": 1,
    " We are going to win.": 1,
    " because we don't understand politics.": 1,
    "We are going to win because we don't play their dirty games.": 1,
    "We are going to win because we don't have a party political agenda.": 1,
    " We're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts.": 1,
    "We're going to win because we've dreams, and we're willing to stand up for those dreams.": 1,
    " Whale is right.": 1,
    " We're going to win if we work together as one because the power of the people is so much stronger than the people in power.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " Thank you so much.": 1
