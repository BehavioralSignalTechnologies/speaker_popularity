    "Yes.": 3,
    " The problem that I want to talk with you about is really the problem of how does one supply healthcare in a world in which cost is everything?": 1,
    "How do you do that?": 1,
    " And the basic paradigm we want to suggest to you, I want to suggest to you, is one in which you say that in order to treat disease, you have to first know what you're treating.": 1,
    "That's diagnostics.": 1,
    "And then you have to do something.": 1,
    " So the program that we're involved in is something which we call Diagnostics for All or Zero Cost Diagnostics.": 1,
    "How do you provide medically relevant information at as close as possible to zero cost?": 1,
    "How do you do it?": 1,
    " Let me just give you two examples.": 1,
    "The rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world.": 1,
    "Poor resources, a rigorous environment, a series of problems in light weight and things of this kind.": 1,
    " and also not so different from the home health care and diagnostic system world.": 1,
    "So the technology that I want to talk about is for the third world, for the developing world,": 1,
    " but it has, I think, much broader application because information is so important in the healthcare system.": 1,
    " So you see two examples here.": 1,
    "One is a lab that's actually a fairly high-end laboratory in Africa.": 1,
    "The second is basically an entrepreneur who's set up and doing who knows what in a table in a market.": 1,
    " I don't know what kind of health care is delivered there, but it's not really what is probably most efficient.": 1,
    " What is our approach?": 1,
    "And the way in which one typically approaches a problem of lowering cost, starting from the perspective of the United States, is to take our solution": 1,
    " and then to try to cut cost out of it.": 1,
    "No matter how you do that, you're not going to start with a $100,000 instrument and bring it down to no cost.": 1,
    "It isn't going to work.": 1,
    " So the approach that we took was the other way around, to ask what is the cheapest possible stuff that you could make a diagnostic system out of and get useful information, add function.": 1,
    "And what we've chosen is paper.": 1,
    " What you see here is a prototypic device.": 1,
    "It's about a centimeter on the side.": 1,
    "It's about the size of a fingernail.": 1,
    "The lines around the edges are a polymer.": 1,
    "It's made of paper.": 1,
    " And paper, of course, wicks fluid.": 1,
    "As you know, paper cloths drop wine on the table cloth, and the wine wicks all over everything.": 1,
    "If you put it on your shirt, it ruins the shirt.": 1,
    "That's what a hydrophilic surface does.": 1,
    " So in this device, the idea is that you dip the bottom end of it in a drop of, in this case, urine.": 1,
    "The fluid wicks its way into those chambers at the top.": 1,
    "The brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine.": 1,
    " The blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine and the combination of those two is a first order shot at a number of useful things that you want.": 1,
    " So this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper.": 1,
    "Now, how simple can you make the production?": 1,
    "Why do we choose paper?": 1,
    "There's an example of the same thing on a finger showing you just basically what it looks like.": 1,
    " One reason for using paper is that it's everywhere.": 1,
    "We have made these kinds of devices using napkins and toilet paper and wraps and all kinds of stuff.": 1,
    "So the production capability is there.": 1,
    " The second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place.": 1,
    "I'll show you in a moment that the stack of paper there would probably hold something like a hundred thousand tests, something of that kind.": 1,
    " And then finally, a point that you don't think of so much in developed world medicine, it eliminates sharps.": 1,
    "And what sharps means is needles, things that stick.": 1,
    "You've taken a sample of someone's blood.": 1,
    " and someone might have hepatitis C, you don't want to make a mistake and stick it in you.": 1,
    "You don't want to do that.": 1,
    "So how do you dispose of that?": 1,
    "It's a problem everywhere and here you simply burn it.": 1,
    "So it's sort of a practical approach to starting on things.": 1,
    " Now you say, if paper's a good idea, other people have surely thought of it.": 1,
    "And the answer is, of course, yes.": 1,
    "Those half of you, roughly, who are women, at some point may have had a pregnancy test.": 1,
    " And the most common of these is in a device that looks like the thing on the left.": 1,
    "It's something called a lateral flow immunoassay.": 1,
    "And in that particular test, urine": 1,
    " either containing a hormone called HCG does or does not flow across a piece of paper and there are two bars.": 1,
    "One bar indicates that the test is working and if the second bar shows up, you're pregnant.": 1,
    "This is a terrific kind of test.": 1,
    " in a binary world.": 1,
    "And the nice thing about pregnancy is either you are pregnant or you're not pregnant, you're not partially pregnant or thinking about being pregnant or something of that sort.": 1,
    "So it works very well there, but it doesn't work very well when you need more quantitative information.": 1,
    " There are also dipsticks, but if you look at the dipsticks there for another kind of urine analysis, there are an awful lot of colors and things like that.": 1,
    "What do you actually do about that in a difficult circumstance?": 1,
    " So the approach that we've started with is to ask, is it really practical to make things of this sort?": 1,
    "And that problem is now, in a purely engineering way, solved.": 1,
    " And the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper.": 1,
    "You run it through a new kind of printer called a wax printer.": 1,
    "The wax printer does what looks like printing.": 1,
    "It is printing.": 1,
    " You put that on, you warm it a little bit, the wax prints through, so it sores into the paper, and you end up with the device that you want.": 1,
    "The printers cost 800 bucks now.": 1,
    "They'll make": 1,
    " We estimate that if you were to run them 24 hours a day, they'd make about 10 million tests a year.": 1,
    "So it's a solved problem.": 1,
    "That particular problem is a solved.": 1,
    "And there's an example of the kind of thing that you see.": 1,
    "That's on a piece of 8 by 12 paper.": 1,
    "That takes about two seconds to make.": 1,
    " And so I regard that as done.": 1,
    "There's a very important issue here, which is that because it's a printer, a color printer, it prints colors.": 1,
    "That's what color printers do.": 1,
    "I'll show you in a moment that's actually quite useful.": 1,
    " Now the next question that you would like to ask is, what would you like to measure?": 1,
    "What would you like to analyze?": 1,
    "And the thing which you'd most like to analyze, we're a fair distance from, it's what's called fever of undiagnosed origin.": 1,
    " Someone comes into the clinic, they have a fever, they feel bad.": 1,
    "What do they have?": 1,
    "Do they have TB?": 1,
    "Do they have AIDS?": 1,
    "Do they have a common cold?": 1,
    "The triage problem.": 1,
    "That's a hard problem for reasons that I won't go through.": 1,
    "There are an awful lot of things that you'd like to distinguish among.": 1,
    " But then there are a series of things, AIDS, hepatitis, malaria, TB, others, and simpler ones such as guidance of treatment.": 1,
    "Now even that's more complicated than you think.": 1,
    " A friend of mine works in transcultural psychiatry, and he is interested in the question of why people do and don't take their meds.": 1,
    "So Dapsone or something like that, you have to take it for a while.": 1,
    " There's a wonderful story of talking to a villager in India and saying, have you taken your DAP zone?": 1,
    "Have you taken it every day?": 1,
    "Have you taken it for a month?": 1,
    " What the guy actually meant was that he'd fed 30-day dose of Dapsone to his dog that morning.": 1,
    " He was telling the truth because in a different culture, you know, the dog is a surrogate.": 1,
    "For you, you know, today, this month, since the rainy season, there are lots of opportunities for misunderstanding.": 1,
    " And so an issue here is to, in some cases, to figure out how to deal with matters that seem uninteresting like compliance.": 1,
    " Now, take a look at what a typical test looks like.": 1,
    " Prick a finger, you get some blood, about 50 microliters.": 1,
    "That's about all you're going to get because you can't use the usual sort of systems.": 1,
    "You can't manipulate it very well, although I'll show something about that in a moment.": 1,
    " So you take the drop of blood, no further manipulation, you put it on a little device, the device filters out the blood cells, lets the serum go through, and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there.": 1,
    "And the colors": 1,
    " indicate disease or normal.": 1,
    "But even that's complicated because to you, to me, colors might indicate normal.": 1,
    "But after all, we're all suffering from and probably an excess of education.": 1,
    " what you do about something which requires quantitative analysis.": 1,
    "And so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there, and at this point there's a dramatic flourish": 1,
    " and out comes the universal solution to everything these days, which is a cell phone, in this particular case a camera phone.": 1,
    "They're everywhere, six billion a month in India, and the idea is that what one does is to": 1,
    " Take the device.": 1,
    "You dip it.": 1,
    "You develop the color.": 1,
    "You take a picture.": 1,
    "The picture goes to a central laboratory.": 1,
    "You don't have to send out a doctor.": 1,
    "You send out somebody who can just take the sample.": 1,
    " and in the clinic either a doctor or ideally a computer in this case does the analysis.": 1,
    "Turns out to work actually quite well, particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work.": 1,
    "So my view of the healthcare worker of the future": 1,
    " It's not a doctor, but it's an 18-year-old, otherwise unemployed, who has two things.": 1,
    "He has a backpack full of these tests and a lancet to occasionally take a blood sample and an AK-47.": 1,
    "And these are the things that get him through his day.": 1,
    " There's another very interesting connection here, and that is that what one wants to do is to pass through useful information over what is generally a pretty awful telephone system.": 1,
    " It turns out there's an enormous amount of information already available on that subject, which is the Mars rover problem.": 1,
    "How do you get back an accurate view of the color on Mars if you have a really terrible bandwidth to do it with?": 1,
    " And the answer is not complicated, but it's one which I don't want to go through here, other than to say that the communication systems for doing this are really pretty well understood.": 1,
    "Also, a fact which you may not know is that the compute capability of this thing": 1,
    " is not so different from the compute capability of your desktop computer.": 1,
    "This is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped.": 1,
    "I don't know whether the idea of one computer, one child,": 1,
    " makes any sense that here's the computer of the future because the screen is already there and they're ubiquitous.": 1,
    " Alright, now let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices and we'll start by posing a little problem.": 1,
    "What you see here is another centimeter size device and the different colors are different colors of dye.": 1,
    " And you notice something which might strike you as a little bit interesting, which is the yellow seems to disappear and get through the blue and then get through the red.": 1,
    "How does that happen?": 1,
    "How do you make something flow through something?": 1,
    "And of course the answer is you don't.": 1,
    " You make it flow under and over.": 1,
    "But now the question is, how do you make it flow under and over in a piece of paper?": 1,
    " And the answer is that what you do, and the details are not terribly important here, is to make something more elaborate.": 1,
    "You take several different layers of paper, each one containing its own little fluid system.": 1,
    " and you separate them by pieces of literally double-sided carpet tape, the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor, and the fluid will flow from one layer into the next.": 1,
    "It distributes itself": 1,
    " flows through further holes, distributes itself.": 1,
    "And what you see in the lower right hand side there is a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top.": 1,
    " and it has gone through and distributed itself into these 16 holes on the bottom in a piece of paper.": 1,
    "Basically it looks like a chip, two pieces of paper thick.": 1,
    "And in this particular case we were just interested in the replicability of that": 1,
    " But that is in principle the way you solve the fever unexplained origin problem.": 1,
    "Because each one of those spots then becomes a test for a particular set of markers of disease.": 1,
    "And this will work in due course.": 1,
    " And here's an example of a slightly more complicated device.": 1,
    "There's the chip.": 1,
    "You dip in a corner.": 1,
    "The fluid goes into the center.": 1,
    "It distributes itself out into these various wells or holes and turns color.": 1,
    "And all done with paper and carpet tape.": 1,
    " So it's, I think, as low cost as we're likely to be able to come up and make things.": 1,
    " Now I have one last, two last little stories to tell you in finishing off this business.": 1,
    "This is one, one of the things that one does occasionally need to do is to separate blood from, blood cells from serum.": 1,
    " And the question was, here we do it by taking a sample, we put it in a centrifuge, we spin it, and you get blood cells out.": 1,
    "Terrific.": 1,
    "What happens if you don't have an electricity and a centrifuge and whatever?": 1,
    " We thought for a while of how you might do this or the way in fact you do it is what's shown here You get a egg beater Which is everywhere and you saw off a blade and then you take tubing and you stick it on that you put the blood in you Spin it somebody sits there and spins it": 1,
    " It works really, really well.": 1,
    "And we sat down, we did the physics of egg beaters and self-aligning tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing, sent it off to a journal.": 1,
    "We were very proud of this, particularly the title, which was Egg Beater as Centrifuge.": 1,
    " And we set it off and by return mail it came back.": 1,
    "I called up the editor and I said, what's going on?": 1,
    "How is this possible?": 1,
    "The editor said, with enormous disdain, I read this.": 1,
    " And we're not going to publish it because we only publish science.": 1,
    " And it's an important issue because it means that we have to, as a society, think about what we value.": 1,
    "And if it's just papers and FISREV letters, we've got a problem.": 1,
    " Here's another example of something, which is this is a little spectrophotometer.": 1,
    "It measures the absorption of light in a sample.": 1,
    "The neat thing about this is you have light source that flickers on and off at about a thousand hertz.": 1,
    " another light source that detects that light at 1000 Hz, and so you can run this system in broad daylight.": 1,
    "It performs about equivalently to a system that's in the order of $100,000.": 1,
    " It costs $50.": 1,
    "We can probably make it for 50 cents if we put our mind to it.": 1,
    "Why doesn't somebody do it?": 1,
    "And the answer is, how do you make a profit in a capitalist system doing that?": 1,
    " interesting problem.": 1,
    " So, let me finish by saying that": 1,
    " We thought about this as a kind of engineering problem.": 1,
    "And we've asked, what is the scientific unifying idea here?": 1,
    "And we've decided that we should think about this, not so much in terms of cost, but in terms of simplicity.": 1,
    " Simplicity is a neat word.": 1,
    "You've got to think about what simplicity means.": 1,
    "I know what it is, but I don't actually know what it means.": 1,
    "So I'm actually interested enough in this to put together a": 1,
    " several groups of people.": 1,
    "The most recent involved a couple of people at MIT, one of them being an exceptionally bright kid who's one of the very few people I would think of who's an authentic genius.": 1,
    "We all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity.": 1,
    " And I want to give you the answer of this deep scientific thought.": 1,
    " So in a sense, you get what you pay for.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
