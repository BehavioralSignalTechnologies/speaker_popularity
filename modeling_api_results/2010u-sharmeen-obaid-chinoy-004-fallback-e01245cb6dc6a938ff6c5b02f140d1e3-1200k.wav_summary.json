    " Today I want you to look at children who become suicide bombers through a completely different lens.": 1,
    "In 2009, there were 500 bomb blasts across Pakistan.": 1,

    "We used a lot of these.": 1,
    " Do you want to attack the Fidai?": 1,
    "May Allah protect you.": 1,
    " I in my research have seen that the Taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children.": 1,
    "And I think it's a five-step process.": 1,
    " Step one is that the Taliban prey on families that are large, that are poor, that live in rural areas.": 1,
    " They separate the parents from the children by promising to provide food, clothing, shelter to these children.": 1,
    "Then they ship them off hundreds of miles away to hardline schools that run along the Taliban agenda.": 1,

    " They talk to them about how when they die, they will be received up with lakes of honey and milk.": 1,
    " how there will be 72 virgins waiting for them in paradise, how there will be unlimited food, and how this glory is going to propel them to become heroes in their neighborhoods.": 1,
    " Effectively, this is the brainwashing process that has begun.": 1,
    "Step five, I believe the Taliban have one of the most effective means of propaganda.": 1,
    "Their videos that they use": 1,
    " are intercut with photographs of men and women and children dying in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and in Pakistan.": 1,
    "And the basic message is that the Western powers do not care about civilian deaths.": 1,
    "So those people who live": 1,
    " in areas and support governments that work with Western powers are fair game.": 1,

    " This boy is called Masood.": 1,
    "He killed 28.": 1,
    " The Taliban are running suicide schools, preparing a generation of boys for atrocities against civilians.": 1,
    " Do you think you will ever want to attack the FIDAI?": 1,
    "I am very interested, but if I get permission from my parents, I will do it.": 1,
    " When I see people who are younger than me or older than me, I get emotional.": 1,
    "What will you gain from this attack?": 1,
    " God will ask you why you did this on the Day of Judgment.": 1,
    " If I see blood or fire, I will say, O Allah, please grant me this life and fight against the disbelievers.": 1,
    " My intention is to get rid of these evil people.": 1,
    " or to raise the name of Islam, then Allah Almighty will give me a place in Paradise.": 1,
    " This question should be answered": 1,
    " I leave you all with this thought.": 1,
    "If you grew up in these circumstances faced with these choices, would you choose to live in this world?": 1,
