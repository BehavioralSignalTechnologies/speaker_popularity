    "15 years later, 14, 15 years later, follow-up story.": 1,
    " What did they find?": 1,

    "I used four, five, and six years old kids.": 1,
    "And let me show you what happened.": 1,
    " Even for a 4-year-old, the idea of having a 100% return to investment in 15 minutes is attractive.": 1,

    "Hispanic kids, two out of three, ate the marshmallow.": 1,
    "One out of three did not.": 1,
    "This little girl was interesting.": 1,
    "She ate the inside of the marshmallow.": 1,
    " In other words, she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it, so she would get two, but she ate it.": 1,
    "So we know she'll be successful, but we have to watch her.": 1,
    " She should not go into banking, for example, or work in a cash register, but she will be successful.": 1,
    " This applies for everything, even in sales, the salesperson that the customer says, I want that.": 1,
    "And they say, okay, here you are, the person who made the marshmallow.": 1,
    " If the salesperson said, wait a second, let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice, then you sell a lot more.": 1,
    "So this has applications in all walks of life.": 1,

    "You know what is so good?": 1,
    "We want a marshmallow book for children.": 1,
