    " What does that mean?": 2,
    " So what does the happiest man in the world look like?": 1,
    "Certainly doesn't look like me, right?": 1,
    "He looks like this.": 1,
    " His name is Mathieu Ricard.": 1,
    "So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world?": 1,
    " Well, it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain.": 1,
    "And you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI versus the right prefrontal cortex.": 1,
    " And Matthew's happiness measure is off the charts.": 1,
    "He is by far the happiest man ever measured by science.": 1,
    "Which leads us to a question.": 1,
    " What was he thinking when he was being measured?": 1,
    "Perhaps something very naughty.": 1,
    "Actually, he was meditating on compassion.": 1,
    " Matthew's own experience is that compassion is the happiest state ever.": 1,
    "Reading about Matthew was one of the pivotal moments of my life.": 1,
    " My dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime.": 1,
    "And to do that by creating the conditions for inner peace and compassion on a global scale.": 1,
    " And learning about Matthew gave me a new angle to look at my work.": 1,
    "Matthew's brain scan shows that compassion is not a troll.": 1,
    "Compassion is something that creates happiness.": 1,
    "Compassion is fun.": 1,
    " And that mind-blowing insight changes the entire game.": 1,
    "Because if compassion was a chore, nobody's going to do it, except maybe the Dalai Lama or something.": 1,
    "But if compassion was fun,": 1,
    " Everybody's going to do it, right?": 1,
    "Therefore, to create the conditions for global compassion, all we have to do, all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun.": 1,
    " But fun is not enough.": 1,
    " What if compassion is also profitable?": 1,
    "What if compassion is also good for business?": 1,
    "Then every boss, every manager in the world will want to have compassion, like this.": 1,
    " That would create the conditions for world peace.": 1,
    " So I started paying attention to what compassion looks like in a business setting.": 1,
    "Fortunately, I didn't have to look very far, because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes, in Google, my company.": 1,
    " I know there are other compassionate companies in the world, but Google is sort of the place I'm familiar with because I've been there for 10 years.": 1,
    "So I'll use Google as the case study.": 1,
    " Google is a company born of idealism.": 1,
    "It's a company that thrives on idealism.": 1,
    "And maybe because of that, compassion is organic and widespread company-wide.": 1,
    " In Google, expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern.": 1,
    "It's sort of a funny pattern.": 1,
    "It starts with a small group of Googlers taking the initiative to do something.": 1,
    " And they don't usually ask for permission.": 1,
    "They just go ahead and do it.": 1,
    "And then other Googlers join in.": 1,
    "And it just gets bigger and bigger.": 1,
    "And sometimes it gets big enough to become official.": 1,
    " So in other words, it almost always starts from bottom up.": 1,
    " And let me give you some examples.": 1,
    "The first example is the largest annual community event where Googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities was initiated and organized by three employees.": 1,
    " before it became official, because it just became too big.": 1,
    "Another example, three Googles, a chef.": 1,
    " An engineer, and most funny, a massage therapist.": 1,
    "Three of them, they learn about a region in India where 200,000 people live without a single medical facility.": 1,
    " So what did they do?": 1,
    "They just go ahead and started a fundraiser.": 1,
    "And they raised enough money to build this hospital.": 1,
    "The first hospital of its kind for 200,000 people.": 1,
    " During the Haiti earthquake, a number of engineers and product managers spontaneously came together and stayed up overnight to build a tool to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones.": 1,
    " And expressions of compassion is also found in our international offices.": 1,
    "In China, for example.": 1,
    " One mid-level employee initiated the largest social action competition in China involving more than 1,000 schools in China.": 1,
    " working on issues such as education, poverty, healthcare and the environment.": 1,
    " There is so much organic social action all around Google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support this effort.": 1,
    " And this idea, again, came from the grassroots, from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job.": 1,
    " And I found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy.": 1,
    "It was like two persons say, let's do this.": 1,
    "And the company said yes.": 1,
    " So it turns out that Google is a compassionate company because Googlers found compassion to be fun.": 1,
    " But again, fun is not enough.": 1,
    "There are also real business benefits.": 1,
    "So what are they?": 1,
    "The first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders.": 1,
    "There are three components of compassion.": 1,
    "There is the effective component, which is I feel for you.": 1,
    " There is a cognitive component, which is I understand you.": 1,
    "And there is a motivational component, which is I want to help you.": 1,
    " So what has this got to do with business leadership?": 1,
    " According to a very comprehensive study led by Jim Collins and documented in the book Good to Great, it takes a very special kind of leader to bring a company from goodness to greatness.": 1,
    " and he calls them level five leaders.": 1,
    " These are leaders who, in addition to being highly capable, possess two important qualities.": 1,
    "And they are humility and ambition.": 1,
    " These are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good.": 1,
    "And because they are ambitious for greater good, they feel no need to inflate their own egos.": 1,
    "And they, according to the research, make the best business leaders.": 1,
    " And if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion, we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion": 1,
    " understanding people and empathizing with people inhibits, tones down what I call the excessive self-obsession as in us, therefore creating the conditions for humility.": 1,
    " The motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good.": 1,
    " In other words, compassion is the way to grow level five leaders.": 1,
    "And this is its first compelling business benefit.": 1,
    " The second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce.": 1,
    " Employees mutually inspire each other towards greater good.": 1,
    "It creates a vibrant, energetic community where people admire and respect each other.": 1,
    " I mean, you come to work in the morning, and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in India.": 1,
    "How can you not be inspired by those people, your own co-workers?": 1,
    " So this mutual inspiration promotes collaboration, initiative, and creativity.": 1,
    "It makes us a highly effective company.": 1,
    " So having said all that, what is the secret formula for brewing compassion in the corporate setting?": 1,
    "In our experience, there are three ingredients.": 1,
    " The first ingredient is to create a culture of passionate concern for the greater good.": 1,
    " So always think, how is your company and your job serving the greater good?": 1,
    "Or how can you further serve the greater good?": 1,
    " This awareness of serving greater good is very self-inspiring, and it creates fertile grounds for compassion to grow in.": 1,
    "That's one.": 1,
    "The second ingredient is autonomy.": 1,
    " So in Google, there's a lot of autonomy.": 1,
    "And one of our most popular managers joke that this is what he says.": 1,
    "Google is a place where the inmates run the asylum.": 1,
    " and he considers himself one of the inmates.": 1,
    "If you already have a culture of compassion and idealism and you let your people roam free, they will do the right thing in the most compassionate way.": 1,
    " The third ingredient is to focus on inner development and personal growth.": 1,
    " Leadership training in Google, for example, places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities such as self-awareness, self-mastery, empathy, and compassion.": 1,
    " Because we believe that leadership begins with character.": 1,
    " We even created a seven-week curriculum on emotional intelligence, which we jokingly call Search Inside Yourself.": 1,
    " It is less naughty than it sounds.": 1,
    "So I'm an engineer by training, but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course.": 1,
    " which I find kind of funny because this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotional intelligence.": 1,
    "So what a company.": 1,
    " So search inside yourself.": 1,
    "How does it work?": 1,
    "It works in three steps.": 1,
    "The first step is attention training.": 1,
    " Attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities.": 1,
    " Therefore, any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training.": 1,
    " The idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time.": 1,
    "And this creates the foundation for emotional intelligence.": 1,
    " The second step follows the first step.": 1,
    "The second step is developing self-knowledge and self-mastery.": 1,
    "So using the supercharged attention from step one.": 1,
    " we create a high resolution perception into the cognitive and emotive processes.": 1,
    "What does that mean?": 1,
    "It means being able to observe our thought stream.": 1,
    " and the process of emotion with high clarity, objectivity, and from a third-person perspective.": 1,
    " And once you can do that, you create the kind of self-knowledge that enables self-mastery.": 1,
    " The third step, following the second step, is to create new mental habits.": 1,
    "Imagine this.": 1,
    "Imagine whenever you meet any other person.": 1,
    "Anytime you meet a person, your habitual instinctive first thought is, I want you to be happy.": 1,
    " I want you to be happy.": 1,
    "Imagine you can do that.": 1,
    "Having this habit, this mental habit, changes everything at work.": 1,
    " Because this goodwill is unconsciously picked up by other people.": 1,
    "And it creates trust.": 1,
    "And trust creates a lot of good working relationships.": 1,
    " And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace.": 1,
    " Someday, we hope to open source Search Inside Yourself so that everybody in the corporate world will at least be able to use it as a reference.": 1,
    " And in closing, I want to end the same place I started, with happiness.": 1,
    " I want to quote this guy, the guy in robes, not the other guy, the Dalai Lama, who said, if you want others to be happy, practice compassion.": 1,
    "If you want to be happy, practice compassion.": 1,
    " I found this to be true both on the individual level and at a corporate level.": 1,
    "And I hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
