    " So when I was in art school, I developed a shake in my hand and this was the straightest line I could draw.": 1,
    " Now, in hindsight, it was actually good for some things like mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid.": 1,
    "But at the time, this was really doomsday.": 1,
    "This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist.": 1,
    " The shake developed out of really a single-minded pursuit of pointillism, just years of making tiny, tiny dots.": 1,
    "And eventually these dots went from being perfectly round to looking more like tadpoles because of the shake.": 1,
    " So to compensate, I'd hold the pen tighter, and this progressively made the shake worse, so I'd hold the pen tighter still.": 1,
    "And this became a vicious cycle that ended up causing so much pain and joint issues, I had trouble holding anything.": 1,
    " And after spending all my life wanting to do art, I left art school, and then I left art completely.": 1,
    " But after a few years, I just couldn't stay away from art, and I decided to go to a neurologist about the shake and discovered I had permanent nerve damage.": 1,
    "And he actually took one look at my squiggly line and said, well, why don't you just embrace the shake?": 1,
    " So I did.": 1,
    "I went home, I grabbed a pencil, and I just started letting my hand shake and shake.": 1,
    "I was making all these scribble pictures.": 1,
    "And even though it wasn't the kind of art that I was ultimately passionate about, it felt great.": 1,
    " And more importantly, once I embraced the shake, I realized I could still make art.": 1,
    "I just had to find a different approach to making the art that I wanted.": 1,
    " Now, I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism, seeing these little tiny dots come together to make this unified whole.": 1,
    "So I began experimenting with other ways to fragment images where the shake wouldn't affect the work, like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas.": 1,
    " or in a 3D structure consisting of 2x4s, creating a 2D image by burning it with a blowtorch.": 1,
    " I discovered that if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials, my hand really wouldn't hurt.": 1,
    "And after having gone from a single approach to art, I ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons.": 1,
    " This was the first time I encountered this idea that embracing the limitation could actually drive creativity.": 1,
    " At the time, I was finishing up school and I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies.": 1,
    "I had this horrible little set of tools and I felt like I could do so much more with the supplies I thought an artist was supposed to have.": 1,
    " I actually didn't even have a regular pair of scissors.": 1,
    "I was using these metal shears until I stole a pair from the office that I worked at.": 1,
    " So I got out of school, I got a job, I got a paycheck, I got myself to the art store, and I just went nuts buying supplies.": 1,
    "And then when I got home, I sat down and I set myself to test to really try to create something just completely outside of the box.": 1,
    " But I sat there for hours, and nothing came to mind.": 1,
    " The same thing the next day and then the next, quickly slipping into a creative slump.": 1,
    " And I was in a dark place for a long time, unable to create.": 1,
    "And it didn't make any sense because I was finally able to support my art, and yet I was creatively blank.": 1,
    " But as I searched around in the darkness, I realized I was actually paralyzed by all of the choices that I never had before.": 1,
    " And it was then that I thought back to my jittery hands.": 1,
    " Embrace the shake.": 1,
    " And I realized if I ever wanted my creativity back, I had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box and get back into it.": 1,
    " I wondered, could you become more creative then by looking for limitations?": 1,
    "What if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies?": 1,
    " At this point, I was spending a lot of my evenings in, well, I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks, but I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one.": 1,
    " So I decided to ask for 50.": 1,
    "Surprisingly, they just handed them right over, and then with some pencils I already had, I made this project for only 80 cents.": 1,
    "It really became a moment of clarification for me that we need to first be limited": 1,
    " in order to become limitless.": 1,
    "I took this approach of thinking inside the box to my canvas and wondered what if instead of painting on a canvas, I could only paint on my chest.": 1,
    " So I painted 30 images, one layer at a time, one on top of another, with each picture representing an influence in my life.": 1,
    " Or what if instead of painting with a brush, I can only paint with karate chops?": 1,
    "So I dipped my hands in paint and I just attacked the canvas and I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinky and it was stuck straight for a couple weeks.": 1,
    " Or, what if instead of relying on myself, I had to rely on other people to create the content for the art?": 1,
    " So for six days, I lived in front of a webcam, I slept on the floor, and I ate takeout.": 1,
    "And I asked people to call me and share a story with me about a life-changing moment.": 1,
    "Their stories became the art as I wrote them onto the revolving canvas.": 1,
    " Or...": 1,
    " What if instead of making art to display, I had to destroy it?": 1,
    "This seemed like the ultimate limitation, being an artist without art.": 1,
    " This destruction idea turned into a year-long project that I called Goodbye Art, where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation.": 1,
    " In the beginning of Goodbye Art, I focused on forced destruction, like this image of Jimi Hendrix, made with over 7,000 matches.": 1,
    " Then I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally.": 1,
    "I looked for temporary materials, like spitting out food.": 1,
    " Sidewalk chalk.": 1,
    " and even frozen wine.": 1,
    " The last iteration of destruction was to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place.": 1,
    "So I organized candles on a table, I lit them and then blew them out, then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles.": 1,
    " then assembled the videos into the larger image.": 1,
    "So the end image was never visible as a physical whole.": 1,
    "It was destroyed before it ever existed.": 1,
    " In the course of this Goodbye R series, I created 23 different pieces with nothing left to physically display.": 1,
    " What I thought would be the ultimate limitation actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation, as each time I created, the destruction brought me back to a neutral place where": 1,
    " I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project.": 1,
    "It did not happen overnight.": 1,
    "There were times when my projects failed to get off the ground, or even worse, after spending tons of time on them, the end image was kind of embarrassing.": 1,
    " But having committed to the process, I continued on, and something really surprising came out of this.": 1,
    "As I destroyed each project, I was learning to let go.": 1,
    " let go of outcomes, let go of failures, and let go of imperfections.": 1,
    "And in return, I found a process of creating art that's perpetual and unencumbered by results.": 1,
    " I found myself in a state of constant creation, thinking only of what's next and coming up with more ideas than ever.": 1,
    "I think back to my three years away from art, away from my dream, just going through the motions.": 1,
    " Instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream, I just quit.": 1,
    "I gave up.": 1,
    " And what if I didn't embrace the shake?": 1,
    "Because embracing the shake for me wasn't just about arts and having art skills.": 1,
    "It turned out to be about life and having life skills.": 1,
    " Because ultimately, most of what we do takes place here, inside the box, with limited resources.": 1,
    "Learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations": 1,
    " is the best hope we have to transform ourselves and collectively transform our world.": 1,
    " looking at limitations as a source of creativity, changed the course of my life.": 1,
    " Now when I run into a barrier or I find myself creatively stumped, I sometimes still struggle, but I continue to show up for the process and try to remind myself of the possibilities.": 1,
    " like using hundreds of real live worms to make an image.": 1,
    " using a push pin to tattoo a banana.": 1,
    " or painting a picture with hamburger grease.": 1,
    " One of my most recent endeavors is to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned into something others can replicate.": 1,
    " Limitations may be the most unlikely of places to harness creativity, but perhaps one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts, rethink categories, and challenge accepted norms.": 1,
    " And instead of telling each other to seize the day, maybe we can remind ourselves every day to seize the limitation.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
