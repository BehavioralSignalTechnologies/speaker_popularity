    "Here we go.": 2,
    " Thank you.": 2,
    " This one I get to, if this one I get to, I'm going to share it again, so it's a negation.": 1,
    " me.": 1,
    " But sometimes we can see, because people here do things, we can eat.": 1,
    " And that's one of the things that I enjoy most about this convention.": 1,
    "It's not so much": 1,
    " as to do with what everything is.": 1,
    " But it is within our self-interest to understand the topography of our lives unto ourselves.": 1,
    " The future states that there is no time other than the collapseation of that sensation of the mirror of the memories in which we are living.": 1,
    " Common knowledge, but important nonetheless.": 1,
    " As we face fear in these times, and fear is all around us, we also have anti-fear.": 1,
    " It's hard to imagine or measure.": 1,
    "The background radiation is simply too static to be able to be seen under the normal spectral analysis.": 1,
    " But we feels though, there are times when a lot of us, you know what I'm saying?": 1,
    "But like, you know what I'm saying?": 1,
    "Cause like, as a hip hop thing, you know what I'm saying?": 1,
    "Like Ted, you know, Ted be rocking, you know what I'm saying?": 1,
    "So like, so I wrote a song.": 1,
    " And I hope you guys dig it.": 1,
    "It's a song about people and sasquatches.": 1,
    " Other French science stuff.": 1,
    "That's French science.": 1,
    "Okay.": 1,
    " I've been trying...": 1,
    " All around you.": 1,
    " And I'm a troll with you": 1,
    " Let's see": 1,
    " But every time it gets me here I'll ask my dad if nothing's saved your way": 1,
    " I'm out.": 1,
    " do do do do": 1,
    " And I've been trying to be the light": 1,
    " That you believe in, yeah And every moment, man, I wanna be so, so safe": 1,
    " And if you want, I want to sue your man, baby And you can do anything As long as you don't hurt them on the way back": 1,
    " I wanna tell you what is wrong with me": 1,
    " I'm moving, I'm moving": 1,
    " Bye bye.": 1,
    " And it's like, you know, you can use as many of those things that you want.": 1,
    "Right?": 1,
    " And the computer models, no matter how many that you have and how many people that you use, are never going to be able to arrive at the same conclusions.": 1,
    " Four years ago I worked with a few people at the Brookings Institute and I arrived at a conclusion.": 1,
    " Tomorrow is another day.": 1,
    " Not just any day, but it is a day.": 1,
    " It will get here.": 1,
    "There's no question.": 1,
    " And the important thing to remember is that this simulation is a good one.": 1,
    "It's believable, it's tactile, you can reach out, things are solid, you can move objects from one area to another.": 1,
    " You can feel your body.": 1,
    "You can say, I'd like to go over to this location, and you can move this mass of molecules through the air.": 1,
    " over to another location at will.": 1,
    " That's something you live inside of every day.": 1,
    " Now with the allocation and the understanding of the lack of understanding, we enter into a new era of science.": 1,
    " in which we feel nothing more than so much so as to say that those within themselves,": 1,
    " will figuratively figure into the folding of our non-understanding and our partial understanding to the networks of which we all draw our source and conclusions from.": 1,
    " So, as I say before the last piece,": 1,
    " You feel not as though it is a sphere we live on, rather an infinite plane which has the illusion of leading yourself back to the point of origin.": 1,
    " Once we understand that all the spheres in the sky are just large infinite planes, it will be plain to see.": 1,
    " Okay?": 1,
    "This is my final piece.": 1,
    "And just remember, everything you are is more important to realise the negative space.": 1,
    " as music is only the division of space and it is the space we are listening to divided as such which gives us the information in comparison to something other.": 1,
    " that gives us the idea of what the idea that wants to be transmitted wants to be.": 1,
    "So please, without further ado.": 1,
    " Alright, this is a fun one.": 1,
    "It goes like this.": 1,
    " I'm": 1,
