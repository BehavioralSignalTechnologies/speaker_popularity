    "There's the inside of our lab.": 1,
    "We haven't shown this before, but...": 1,
    " Our people had to do some 5,000 different mixes to get this right, to hit our targets.": 1,
    "And they worked absolutely very, very, very hard.": 1,
    " So then we went forward and built our production line in China.": 1,
    "We don't build this production equipment any longer in the US, unfortunately.": 1,
    "We did the line install over the summer.": 1,
    " we started right there with absolutely nothing you're seeing for the first time a brand new drywall production line not made using gypsum at all that's the finished production line there we got our first panel out on december": 1,
    " Third, that is the slurry being poured onto paper, basically.": 1,
    "That's the line running.": 1,
    "The exciting thing is look at the faces of the people.": 1,

    "Thank you": 1,
    " So here's what we learned.": 1,
    "8,000 gallons of gas equivalent to build one house.": 1,
    "You probably had no idea.": 1,
    "It's like driving around the world six times.": 1,
    "We must change everything.": 1,
    "Look around the room.": 1,
    "Chairs, wood.": 1,
    " everything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem.": 1,
    "Don't listen to the people who say you can't do this because anyone can.": 1,
    "And these job losses, we can fix them with green collar jobs.": 1,
    "We've got four plants.": 1,
    "We're building this stuff around the country.": 1,
    " We're going as fast as we can.": 1,
    "Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum, you know, CO2 generated, right?": 1,
    "So what will you do?": 1,
    "I'll tell you what I did and why I did it, and I know my time's up.": 1,
    " Those are my kids, Natalie and David.": 1,
