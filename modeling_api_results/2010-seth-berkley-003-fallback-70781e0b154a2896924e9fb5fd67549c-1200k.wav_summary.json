    " Thank you.": 3,
    " Do you worry about what is going to kill you?": 1,
    "Heart disease, cancer, a car accident?": 1,
    " Most of us worry about things we can't control, like war, terrorism, the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti.": 1,
    "But what really threatens humanity?": 1,
    " A few years ago, Professor Vaclav Smil tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history.": 1,
    " He called these massively fatal discontinuities, meaning that they could kill up to 100 million people in the next 50 years.": 1,
    "He looked at the odds of another world war.": 1,
    " of a massive volcanic eruption, even of an asteroid hitting the Earth.": 1,
    "But he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to 100%, and that is a severe flu pandemic.": 1,
    " Now, you might think of flu as just a really bad cold, but it can be a death sentence.": 1,
    " Every year, 36,000 people in the United States die of seasonal flu.": 1,
    "In the developing world, the data is much sketchier, but the death toll is almost certainly higher.": 1,
    " You know, the problem is that this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic.": 1,
    " In 1918, a new virus appeared that killed some 50 to 100 million people.": 1,
    "It spread like wildfire, and some died within hours of developing symptoms.": 1,
    " Are we safer today?": 1,
    "Well, we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared, but this threat could reappear at any time.": 1,
    " The good news is that we're at a moment in time when science, technology, globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility.": 1,
    " the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one-fifth of all deaths and countless misery on earth.": 1,
    " We can do this.": 1,
    "We're already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines.": 1,
    "And if we get these to more people, we can certainly save more lives.": 1,
    " But with new or better vaccines for malaria, TB, HIV, pneumonia, diarrhea, flu, we could end suffering that has been on the earth since the beginning of time.": 1,
    " So I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you, but first I have to explain why they're important.": 1,
    "Because vaccines, the power of them is really like a whisper.": 1,
    " When they work, they can make history, but after a while, you can barely hear them.": 1,
    "Now, some of us are old enough to have a small circular scar on our arms from an inoculation we received as children.": 1,
    " But when was the last time you worried about smallpox, a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us?": 1,
    "Or polio, how many of you remember the iron lung?": 1,
    " We don't see scenes like this anymore because of vaccines.": 1,
    "Now, you know, it's interesting because there are 30 odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now, but we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu.": 1,
    " Why is that?": 1,
    "Well, here's the dirty little secret.": 1,
    "Until recently we haven't had to know exactly how a vaccine worked.": 1,
    " We knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error.": 1,
    "You took a pathogen, you modified it, you injected it into a person or an animal, and you saw what happened.": 1,
    " This worked well for most pathogens, somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu, but not at all for HIV, which humans have no natural immunity.": 1,
    " So let's explore how vaccines work.": 1,
    "They basically create a catch of weapons for your immune system": 1,
    " which you can deploy when needed.": 1,
    "Now, when you get a viral infection, what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength, and that might be too late.": 1,
    " When you're pre-immunized, what happens is you have forces in your body pre-trained to recognize and defeat specific foes.": 1,
    " So that's really how vaccines work.": 1,
    "Now let's take a look at a video that we're debuting at TED for the first time on how an effective HIV vaccine might work.": 1,
    " A vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader.": 1,
    "After HIV penetrates the body's mucosal barriers, it infects immune cells to replicate.": 1,
    " The invader draws the attention of the immune system's frontline troops.": 1,
    "Dendritic cells or macrophages capture the virus and display pieces of it.": 1,
    " Memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine are activated when they learn HIV is present from the frontline troops.": 1,
    "These memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed.": 1,
    " Memory B cells turn into plasma cells, which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch on to HIV to prevent it from infecting cells.": 1,
    " while squadrons of killer T cells seek out and destroy cells that are already HIV infected.": 1,
    "The virus is defeated.": 1,
    " Without a vaccine, these responses would have taken more than a week.": 1,
    "By that time, the battle against HIV would already have been lost.": 1,
    " you": 1,
    " Really cool video, isn't it?": 1,
    " The antibodies that you just saw in this video in action are the ones that make most vaccines work.": 1,
    "So the real question then is, how do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and HIV?": 1,
    " The principal challenge for both of these viruses is that they're always changing.": 1,
    "So let's take a look at the flu virus.": 1,
    "In this rendering of the flu virus, these different color spikes are what it uses to infect you.": 1,
    " And also, what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus.": 1,
    "When these mutate, they change their shape, and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore.": 1,
    " So that's why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu.": 1,
    "It's also why in the spring we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year.": 1,
    " put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall.": 1,
    "Even worse, the most common influenza, influenza A,": 1,
    " also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans, and they can recombine in those particular animals.": 1,
    "In addition, wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza.": 1,
    " So, you've got this situation.": 1,
    "In 2003, we had an H5N1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated cases with an apparent mortality rate of 70%.": 1,
    " Now, you know, luckily that particular virus, although very scary at the time, did not transmit from person to person very easily.": 1,
    " This year's H1N1 threat was actually a human-avian swine mixture that arose in Mexico.": 1,
    "It was easily transmitted, but luckily was pretty mild.": 1,
    " And so, in a sense, our luck is holding out, but you know, another wild bird could fly over at any time.": 1,
    " Now let's take a look at HIV.": 1,
    "As variable as flu is, HIV makes flu look like the rock of Gibraltar.": 1,
    " The virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted.": 1,
    "It mutates furiously, it has decoys to evade the immune system, it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it, and it quickly hides itself": 1,
    " in your genome.": 1,
    "Here's a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to HIV, a much wilder target.": 1,
    " In the video a moment ago, you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells.": 1,
    "Now realize that in a recently infected person, there are millions of these ships.": 1,
    "Each one is just slightly different.": 1,
    " Finding a weapon that recognizes and syncs all of them makes the job that much harder.": 1,
    "Now in the 27 years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS,": 1,
    " We've developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together.": 1,
    " These drugs aren't cures, but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of HIV, at least for those who can access them.": 1,
    " The vaccine effort though is really quite different.": 1,
    "Large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business.": 1,
    " Many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine.": 1,
    "But today, evidence tells us otherwise.": 1,
    "In September,": 1,
    " We had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand.": 1,
    "For the first time, we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans, albeit": 1,
    " quite modestly, and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago.": 1,
    "Newer concepts in early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models.": 1,
    " But in the past few months, researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of HIV-infected individual.": 1,
    "Now, what does this mean?": 1,
    " We saw earlier that HIV is highly variable, that a broadly neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus.": 1,
    " If you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models, they provide full protection from infection.": 1,
    "In addition, these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab onto.": 1,
    " And what's so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates.": 1,
    "It's like as many times as the virus": 1,
    " changes its clothes, it's still wearing the same socks, and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks.": 1,
    " So what we've got is a situation.": 1,
    "The tie results tell us we can make an AIDS vaccine, and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that.": 1,
    " This strategy working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate has never been done before in vaccine research.": 1,
    "It's called retro vaccinology and its implications extend way beyond that.": 1,
    " of just HIV.": 1,
    "So think of it this way.": 1,
    " We've got these new antibodies we've identified and we know that they latch on to many, many variations of the virus.": 1,
    "We know that they have to latch on to a specific part.": 1,
    "So if we can figure out the precise structure of that part, present that through a vaccine,": 1,
    " What we hoped is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies.": 1,
    "And that would create a universal HIV vaccine.": 1,
    " Now, it sounds easier than it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site.": 1,
    "And as you can imagine, these three-dimensional structures are much harder to work on.": 1,
    "And if you guys have ideas to help us solve this, we'd love to hear about it.": 1,
    " But, you know, the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases.": 1,
    "So, for instance, a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza, as well as a new": 1,
    " antibody target on the flu virus.": 1,
    "They're currently making a cocktail, an antibody cocktail that can be used to treat severe, overwhelming cases of flu.": 1,
    " Now, in the longer term, what they can do is use these tools of retro-vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine.": 1,
    "Now, retro-vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design.": 1,
    " Let me give you another example.": 1,
    "We talked about before the H and N spikes on the surface of the flu virus.": 1,
    "Notice these other smaller protuberances.": 1,
    "These are largely hidden from the immune system.": 1,
    "Now it turns out that these spots": 1,
    " also don't change much when the virus mutates.": 1,
    "If you can cripple these with specific antibodies, you could cripple all versions of the flu.": 1,
    " So far, animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease, although it might get a mild case.": 1,
    "So if this works in humans, what we're talking about is a universal flu vaccine, one that doesn't need to change every year.": 1,
    " and would remove the threat of death.": 1,
    "We really could think of flu, then, as just a bad cold.": 1,
    " Of course the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it.": 1,
    "So to do that we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and of course smart delivery methods.": 1,
    " So I want you to think back a few months ago.": 1,
    "In June, the World Health Organization declared the first global flu pandemic in 41 years.": 1,
    "The US government promised 150 million doses of vaccine by October 15th for the flu peak.": 1,
    " Vaccines were promised to developing countries.": 1,
    "Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing.": 1,
    "So what happened?": 1,
    " Well, we first figured out how to make flu vaccines, how to produce them in the early 1940s.": 1,
    "It was a slow, cumbersome process that depended on": 1,
    " Chicken eggs, millions of living chicken eggs.": 1,
    "Viruses only grow in living things.": 1,
    "And so it turned out that for flu, chicken eggs worked really well.": 1,
    "For most strains, you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg.": 1,
    " Luckily for us, we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances.": 1,
    "So today we get our flu vaccines from": 1,
    " chicken eggs.": 1,
    " hundreds of millions of chicken eggs.": 1,
    "Almost nothing has changed.": 1,
    "The system is reliable.": 1,
    "But the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow.": 1,
    " This year's swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production, basically 0.6 doses per egg.": 1,
    " So here's an alarming thought.": 1,
    "What if that wild bird flies by again?": 1,
    "You could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks, and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines.": 1,
    " So Dan, if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm, I know where to get them.": 1,
    " So right now, the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains.": 1,
    "And we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu.": 1,
    " But this assumes that our factories are humming.": 1,
    "Because in 2004, the US supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant.": 1,
    "And the process still takes more than half a year.": 1,
    " So are we better prepared than we were in 1918?": 1,
    "Well, with the new technologies emerging now, I hope we can say definitively yes.": 1,
    " Imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we're currently spending now in the United States.": 1,
    " With a range of new technologies, we could.": 1,
    "Here's an example.": 1,
    "A company I'm engaged with has found a specific piece of the H spike of flu that sparks the immune system.": 1,
    " If you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium, which creates a vigorous immune response, they've created a very powerful flu fighter.": 1,
    "This vaccine is so small, it can be grown in a common bacteria E. coli.": 1,
    " Now, as you know, bacteria reproduce quickly.": 1,
    "It's like making yogurt.": 1,
    "And so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories in a few weeks with no eggs for a fraction of the cost of current methods.": 1,
    " So here's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies.": 1,
    "And aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings, for an example, the E. coli method I just talked about, look at the time saved.": 1,
    "This would be lives saved.": 1,
    " The developing world, mostly left out of the current response, sees the potential of these alternate technologies, and they're leapfrogging the West.": 1,
    " India, Mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use.": 1,
    " Because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap, billions of people can have access to life-saving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them.": 1,
    "Now think of where this leads us.": 1,
    " New infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years.": 1,
    "Someday, perhaps soon, we'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us.": 1,
    " Will we be quick enough to react before millions die?": 1,
    "Luckily, this year's flu was relatively mild.": 1,
    "I say luckily in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated.": 1,
    " So if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments, we will master these and new tools of vaccinology.": 1,
    "And with these tools, we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy, productive lives.": 1,
    " No longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year.": 1,
    "No longer does AIDS need to kill two million a year.": 1,
    "No longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases or indeed anybody.": 1,
    " Instead of having Vaclav Smil's massively fatal discontinuity of life, we can ensure the continuity of life.": 1,
    " What the world needs now are these new vaccines and we can make it happen.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1,
    " So.": 1,
    "So the science is changing.": 1,
    " In your mind, Seth, I mean, you must dream about this.": 1,
    "What is the kind of time scale on, let's start with HIV for a game-changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable?": 1,
    " The game change can come at any time because the problem we have now is we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans.": 1,
    "We just need a better one.": 1,
    "And with these types of antibodies, we know humans can make them.": 1,
    "So if we can figure out how to do that,": 1,
    " then we have the vaccine.": 1,
    "And what's interesting is there already is some evidence that we're beginning to crack that problem.": 1,
    "So the challenge is full speed ahead.": 1,
    "In your gut, do you think it's probably going to be at least another five years?": 1,
    "You know, everybody says it's 10 years, but it's been 10 years every 10 years.": 1,
    "So I hate to put...": 1,
    " I hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation, but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends.": 1,
    "And that's the same with universal flu vaccine, the same kind of thing?": 1,
    " I think flu is different.": 1,
    "I think what happened with flu is we've got a bunch of, I've just shown some of them, a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now.": 1,
    " They look good.": 1,
    "The problem has been that what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that's what we were comfortable with.": 1,
    "You also can use adjuvants, which are chemicals you mix.": 1,
    "That's what Europe is doing, so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available.": 1,
    " But going back to what Michael Spector said, you know, the anti-vaxing crowd didn't really want that to happen.": 1,
    "And malaria is even further behind or?": 1,
    " No, malaria, there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in phase three trials.": 1,
    "Now, it probably isn't the perfect vaccine, but it's moving along.": 1,
    " Seth, most of us do work where every month we produce something, we get that kind of gratification.": 1,
    "You've been slaving away at this for more than a decade.": 1,
    "And I salute you and your colleagues for what you do.": 1,
    "The world needs people like you.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
