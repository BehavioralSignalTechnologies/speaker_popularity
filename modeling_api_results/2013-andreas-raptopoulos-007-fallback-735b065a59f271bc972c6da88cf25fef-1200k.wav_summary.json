    " One billion people in the world today do not have access to all season roads.": 1,
    "One billion people, one seventh of the Earth's population, are totally cut off for some part of the year.": 1,
    " We cannot get medicine to them reliably, they cannot get critical supplies, and they cannot get their goods to market in order to create a sustainable income.": 1,
    " In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, 85% of roads are unusable in the wet season.": 1,
    "Investments are being made.": 1,
    "But at the current level, it's estimated it's going to take them 50 years to catch up.": 1,
    " In the US alone, there's more than 4 million miles of roads.": 1,
    "Very expensive to build, very expensive to maintain infrastructure, with huge ecological footprint, and yet very often congested.": 1,
    " So we saw this and we thought, can there be a better way?": 1,
    "Can we create a system using today's most advanced technologies that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog in the same way they've done with mobile telephone in the last 10 years?": 1,
    " Many of those nations have excellent telecommunications today without ever putting copper lines in the grounds.": 1,
    "Could we do the same for transportation?": 1,
    " Imagine this scenario.": 1,
    "Imagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali and have a newborn in need of urgent medication.": 1,
    "What would you do today?": 1,
    " Well, you'd place a request via mobile phone and someone would get the request immediately.": 1,
    "That's the part that works.": 1,
    "The medication may take days to arrive though because of bad roads.": 1,
    "That's the part that's broken.": 1,
    " We believe we can deliver it within hours with an electric autonomous flying vehicle such as this.": 1,
    " This can transport a small payload today, about two kilograms, over a short distance, about 10 kilometers.": 1,
    "But it's part of a wider network that may cover the entire country, maybe even the entire continent.": 1,
    " It's an ultra flexible automated logistics network.": 1,
    "It's a network for the transportation of matter.": 1,
    "We call it Matternet.": 1,
    "We use three key technologies.": 1,
    "The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles.": 1,
    " The second is automated ground stations that the vehicles fly in and out of to swap batteries and fly further, or pick up or deliver loads.": 1,
    "And the third is the operating system that manages the whole network.": 1,
    " Let's look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail.": 1,
    "First of all, the UAVs.": 1,
    "Eventually, we're going to be using all sorts of vehicles for different payload capacities and different ranges.": 1,
    "Today, we're using small quads.": 1,
    " These are able to transport 2 kg over 10 km in just about 15 minutes.": 1,
    "Compare this with trying to trespass a bad road in the developing world or even being stuck in traffic.": 1,
    " in a developed world country.": 1,
    "These fly autonomously.": 1,
    "This is the key to the technology.": 1,
    "So they use GPS and other sensors on boards to navigate between ground stations.": 1,
    " Every vehicle is equipped with an automatic payload and battery exchange mechanism.": 1,
    "So these vehicles navigate those ground stations, they dock, swap the battery automatically, and go out again.": 1,
    " The ground stations are located on safe locations on the ground.": 1,
    "They secure the most vulnerable part of the mission, which is the landing.": 1,
    " They are at known locations on the ground, so the paths between them are also known, which is very important from a reliability perspective from the whole network.": 1,
    " Apart from fulfilling the energy requirements of the vehicles, eventually they're going to be becoming commercial hubs where people can take out loads or put loads into the network.": 1,
    " The last component is the operating system that manages the whole network.": 1,
    "It monitors weather data from all the ground stations and optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system to avoid adverse weather conditions, avoid other risk factors.": 1,
    " and to optimize the use of the resources throughout the network.": 1,
    "I want to show you what one of those flights look like.": 1,
    " Here we are flying in Haiti last summer where we've done our first field trials.": 1,
    "We're modeling here a medical delivery in a camp that was set up after the 2010 earthquake.": 1,
    "People there love this.": 1,
    " And I want to show you what one of those vehicles look like up close.": 1,
    " So this is a $3,000 vehicle, costs are coming down very rapidly.": 1,
    " We use this in all sorts of weather conditions, very hot and very cold climates, very strong winds, they're very sturdy vehicles.": 1,
    " Imagine if your life depended on this package somewhere in Africa or in New York City after Sunday.": 1,
    " The next big question is what's the cost?": 1,
    "Well, it turns out that the cost to transport two kilograms over 10 kilometers with this vehicle": 1,
    " is just 24 cents.": 1,
    " And it's counterintuitive, but the cost of energy expended for that flight is only 2 cents of the dollar today.": 1,
    "And we're just at the beginning of this.": 1,
    " When we saw this, we felt that this is something that can have significant impact in the world.": 1,
    "So we said, okay, you know, how much does it cost to set up a network somewhere in the world?": 1,
    "And we looked at setting up a network in Lesotho for transportation,": 1,
    " of HIV-8 samples, the problem there is how do you take them from clinics where they're being collected to hospitals where they're being analyzed.": 1,
    " And we said, what if we wanted to cover an area spanning around 140 square kilometers?": 1,
    "That's roughly one and a half times the size of Manhattan.": 1,
    "Well, it turns out that the cost to do that there would be less than a million dollars.": 1,
    " Compare this to normal infrastructure investments.": 1,
    "Within this can be, this is the power of a new paradigm.": 1,
    " So, here we are, a new idea about the network for transportation that is based on the ideas of the Internet.": 1,
    "It's decentralized, it's peer-to-peer, it's bidirectional, highly adaptable,": 1,
    " with very low infrastructure investment, very low ecological footprint.": 1,
    " If it is a new paradigm though, there must be other uses for it.": 1,
    "It can be used perhaps in other places in the world.": 1,
    "So let's look at the other end of the spectrum.": 1,
    " our cities and megacities.": 1,
    "Half of the Earth's population lives in cities today.": 1,
    "Half a billion of us live in megacities.": 1,
    "We are living through an amazing urbanization trend.": 1,
    "China alone is adding a megacity the size of New York City every two years.": 1,
    " These are places that do have road infrastructure, but it's very inefficient.": 1,
    " Congestion is a huge problem.": 1,
    "So we think it makes sense in those places to set up a network of transportation that is a new layer that sits between the road and the internet, initially for lightweight urgent stuff.": 1,
    " And over time, we would hope to develop this into a new mode of transportation that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem.": 1,
    " It's ultimately scalable, with very small ecological footprint, operating in the background 24x7, just like the Internet.": 1,
    " So when we started this a couple of years ago now,": 1,
    " We've had a lot of people come up to us and said, you know, this is a very interesting but crazy idea.": 1,
    "And certainly not something that you should engage with anytime soon.": 1,
    " And of course, we're talking about drones, right?": 1,
    "A technology that's not only unpopular in the West, but one that has become a very, very unpleasant fact of life for many living in poor countries, especially those engaged in conflict.": 1,
    " So why are we doing this?": 1,
    " Well, we chose to do this one, not because it's easy.": 1,
    " but because it can have amazing impact.": 1,
    "Imagine one billion people being connected to physical goods in the same way that mobile telecommunications connected them to information.": 1,
    " Imagine if the next big network we built in the world was a network for the transportation of matter.": 1,
    " In the developing world, we would hope to reach millions of people with better vaccines, reach them with better medication.": 1,
    "It would give us an unfair advantage against battling HIV AIDS, tuberculosis, and other epidemics.": 1,
    "Over time, we would hope it would become a new platform": 1,
    " platform for economic transactions, lifting millions of people out of poverty.": 1,
    "In the developed world and the emerging world, we would hope it would become a new mode of transportation that could help make our cities more livable.": 1,
    " So for those that still believe that this is science fiction, I firmly say to you that it is not.": 1,
    "We do need to engage though in social fiction to make it happen.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
