    " I teach chemistry.": 1,
    " All right.": 1,
    "All right.": 1,
    "So more than just explosions, chemistry is everywhere.": 1,
    "Have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out just doing this over and over?": 1,
    "Some people are nodding yes.": 1,
    " Recently, I showed this to my students and I just asked them to try and explain why it happened.": 1,
    "The questions and conversations that followed were fascinating.": 1,
    "Check out this video that Maddie from my period three class sent me that evening.": 1,
    " Are you ready?": 1,
    " Obviously, as Maddie's chemistry teacher, I love that she went home and continued to geek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class.": 1,
    " But what fascinated me more is that Maddie's curiosity took her to a new level.": 1,
    "If you look inside that beaker, you might see a candle.": 1,
    "Maddie's using temperature to extend this phenomena to a new scenario.": 1,
    " You know, questions and curiosity like Maddie's are magnets that draw us towards our teachers.": 1,
    "And they transcend all technology or buzzwords in education.": 1,
    " But if we place these technologies before student inquiry, we can be robbing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers, our students' questions.": 1,
    " For example, flipping a boring lecture from the classroom to the screen of a mobile device might save instructional time, but if it is the focus of our students' experience,": 1,
    " It's the same dehumanizing chatter just wrapped up in fancy clothing.": 1,
    "But if instead we have the guts to confuse our students, perplex them, and evoke real questions,": 1,
    " Through those questions, we as teachers have information that we can use to tailor robust and informed methods of blended instruction.": 1,
    " So 21st century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside, the truth is I've been teaching for 13 years now.": 1,
    " And it took a life-threatening situation to snap me out of 10 years of pseudo-teaching and help me realize that student questions are the seeds of real learning.": 1,
    " Not some scripted curriculum that gave him tidbits of random information.": 1,
    " In May of 2010, at 35 years old, with a two year old at home and my second child on the way, I was diagnosed with a large aneurysm at the base of my thoracic aorta.": 1,
    " This led to open heart surgery.": 1,
    "This is the actual real email from my doctor right there.": 1,
    "Now when I got this, I was, press caps lock, absolutely freaked out, okay?": 1,
    "But I found surprising moments of comfort.": 1,
    " in the confidence that my surgeon embodied.": 1,
    "Where did this guy get this confidence, the audacity of it?": 1,
    "So when I asked him, he told me three things.": 1,
    " He said first, his curiosity drove him to ask hard questions about the procedure, about what worked and what didn't work.": 1,
    "Second,": 1,
    " He embraced and didn't fear the messy process of trial and error, the inevitable process of trial and error.": 1,
    " And third, through intense reflection, he gathered the information that he needed to design and revise the procedure.": 1,
    "And then with a steady hand, he saved my life.": 1,
    " Now, I absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom.": 1,
    "And before I went back into the classroom that fall, I wrote down three rules of my own that I bring to my lesson planning still today.": 1,
    " Rule number one, curiosity comes first.": 1,
    "Questions can be windows to great instruction, but not the other way around.": 1,
    " Rule number two, embrace the mess.": 1,
    "We're all teachers, we know learning is ugly.": 1,
    "And just because the scientific method is allocated to page five of section 1.2 of chapter one of the one that we all skip, okay,": 1,
    " Trial and error can still be an informal part of what we do every single day at Sacred Heart Cathedral in room 206.": 1,
    "And rule number three.": 1,
    " Practice reflection.": 1,
    "What we do is important.": 1,
    "It deserves our care, but it also deserves our revision.": 1,
    "Can we be the surgeons of our classrooms?": 1,
    "As if what we are doing one day will save lives.": 1,
    "Our students are worth it.": 1,
    " and each case is different.": 1,
    " All right, sorry.": 1,
    " Chemistry teacher and me just needed to get that out of my system before we move on.": 1,
    "So these are my daughters.": 1,
    "On the right, you have little Emmalou.": 1,
    " Southern family and on the left Riley now Riley's gonna be a big girl in a couple weeks here She's gonna be four years old and anyone who knows a four-year-old knows that they love to ask": 1,
    " Why?": 1,
    "Yeah, why?": 1,
    "I could teach this kid anything because she is curious about everything.": 1,
    "We all were at that age.": 1,
    " But the challenge is really for Riley's future teachers, the ones she has yet to meet.": 1,
    "How will they grow this curiosity?": 1,
    "You see, I would argue that Riley is a metaphor for all kids.": 1,
    " And I think dropping out of school comes in many different forms.": 1,
    "To the senior who's checked out before the year's even begun, or that empty desk in the back of an urban middle school's classroom.": 1,
    " But if we as educators leave behind the simple role as disseminators of content and embrace a new paradigm as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry.": 1,
    " we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day and spark their imagination.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
