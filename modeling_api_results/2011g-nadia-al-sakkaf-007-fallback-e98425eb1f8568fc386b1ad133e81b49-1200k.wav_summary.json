    " You have brought us images from the Yemen times and take us through those and introduce us to another Yemen.": 1,
    " Well, I'm glad to be here and I would like to share with you all some of the pictures that are happening today in Yemen.": 1,
    "This picture shows a revolution started by women and it shows women and men": 1,
    " leading a mixed protest.": 1,
    "The other picture is a popularity of the real need for change.": 1,
    "So many people are there.": 1,
    " the intensity of the up-spring.": 1,
    "This picture shows that the revolution has allowed opportunities for training.": 1,
    " for education.": 1,
    "These women are learning about first aid and their rights according to the Constitution.": 1,
    "I love this picture.": 1,
    "I just wanted to show that": 1,
    " Over 60% of the Yemeni population are 15 years and below and they were excluded from decision-making and now they are in the forefront of the news.": 1,
    " raising the flag.": 1,
    "English, you will see this is jeans and tights and in English expression, you know, the ability to share with the world.": 1,
    " what is going on in our own country and expression also, it has brought talents.": 1,
    " Yemenis are using cartoons and art, paintings, comics to tell the world and each other about what's going on.": 1,
    "Obviously there is always the dark side of it and this is just a": 1,
    " one of the less gruesome pictures of the revolution and the cost that we have to pay.": 1,
    "The solidarity of millions of Yemenis across the country just demanding the one thing.": 1,
    " And finally, lots of people are saying that Yemen's revolution is going to break the country.": 1,
    "Is it going to be so many different countries?": 1,
    "Is it going to be another Somalia?": 1,
    " but we want to tell the world that no under the one flag will still remain as Yemeni people.": 1,
    " Thank you for those images, Nadia.": 1,
    "And they do, in many ways, tell a different story than the story of Yemen, the one that is often in the news, and yet you yourself defy all those.": 1,
    " characterizations.": 1,
    "So let's talk about the personal story for a moment.": 1,
    "Your father is murdered.": 1,
    "The Yemen Times already has a strong reputation": 1,
    " in Yemen as an independent English language newspaper.": 1,
    "How did you then make the decision and assume the responsibilities of running a newspaper, especially in such times of conflict?": 1,
    " Well, let me first warn you that I am not the traditional Yemeni girl.": 1,
    "I guess you've already noticed this by now.": 1,
    " In Yemen, most women are veiled and they are sitting behind doors and not very much part of the public life.": 1,
    "But there's so much potential.": 1,
    "I wish I could show you my Yemen.": 1,
    "I wish you could see": 1,
    " the Yemen through my eyes, then you will know that there's so much to it.": 1,
    "And I was privileged because I was born into a family.": 1,
    "My father would always encourage the boys and the girls.": 1,
    "He would say,": 1,
    " We are equal and he was such an extraordinary man.": 1,
    "And even my mother, I owe it to my family.": 1,
    "A story, I studied in India and in my third year I started becoming confused.": 1,
    " because I was Yemeni but I was also mixing up with a lot of my friends in college and I went back home and I said, Daddy, I don't know who I am.": 1,
    "I'm not a Yemeni, I'm not an Indian.": 1,
    "And he said, you are the bridge.": 1,
    " And that is something I will keep in my heart forever.": 1,
    "So since then I've been the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me.": 1,
    " I don't think so.": 1,
    "But it just helps tell that some people are change agents in the society.": 1,
    " And when I became editor-in-chief, after my brother actually, my father passed away in 1999, then my brother until 2005, and everybody was betting that I will not be able to do it.": 1,
    " What's this young girl coming and showing off because it's her family business or something?": 1,
    "It was very hard at first.": 1,
    "I didn't want to clash with people.": 1,
    " But with all due respect to all the men, and the older men especially, they did not want me around.": 1,
    "It was very hard to impose my authority.": 1,
    " A woman's got to do what a woman's got to do.": 1,
    " And in the first year, I had to fire half of the men.": 1,
    " brought in more women, brought in younger men, and we have a more gender balanced newsroom today.": 1,
    "The other thing is that it's about professionalism, it's about proving who you are and what you can do.": 1,
    " And I don't know if I'm going to be boasting now, but in 2006 alone, we won three international awards.": 1,
    "One of them is the IPI Free Media Pioneer Award.": 1,
    " That was the answer to all the Yemeni people.": 1,
    "And I want to score a point here because my husband is in the room over there.": 1,
    "If you could please stand up.": 1,
    "He has been very supportive of me.": 1,
    " And we should point out that he works with you as well.": 1,
    "But in assuming this responsibility and going about it as you have, you have become a bridge between an older and traditional": 1,
    " society and the one that you are now creating at the paper.": 1,
    "And so along with changing who worked there, you must have come up against": 1,
    " Another positioning that we always run into in particular with women and it has to do with outside image, dress.": 1,
    " the veiled woman.": 1,
    "So how have you dealt with this on a personal level as well as the women who worked for you?": 1,
    " As you know, the image of Yemeni women is a lot of black and covered veiled women and this is true and a lot of it is because of": 1,
    " Women are not able, are not free to show their face to their self.": 1,
    "It's a lot of traditional imposing coming by authority figures such as the men, the grandparents and so on.": 1,
    " And it's economic empowerment and the ability for a woman to say, I am as much contributing to this family or more than you are.": 1,
    "And the more empowered the women become, the more they are able to take": 1,
    " to remove the veil for example or to drive their own car or to have a job or to be able to travel.": 1,
    "So the other face of Yemen is actually one that lies behind the veil.": 1,
    " And it's economic empowerment mostly that allows the woman to just uncover it.": 1,
    "And I've done this throughout my work.": 1,
    "I've tried to encourage young girls.": 1,
    "We started with, like, you can take it off in the office.": 1,
    " And then after that you can take it off on assignments because I didn't believe a journalist can be a journalist with, you know, how can you talk to people if you have your face covered?": 1,
    " and so on, it's just a movement and I am a role model and a lot of people look up to me, a lot of young girls look up to me.": 1,
    " And I need to prove to them that yes, you can still be married, you can still be a mother, and you can still be respected in the society.": 1,
    "But at the same time, that doesn't mean that you just be one of the crowd.": 1,
    "You can be yourself and have your face.": 1,
    " But by putting yourself personally out there, both projecting a different image of Yemeni women, but also what you have made possible for the women who work at the paper.": 1,
    " Has this put you in personal danger?": 1,
    "Well, the Yemen Times, across 20 years, has been through so much.": 1,
    "We've suffered prosecution.": 1,
    "The paper was closed down three times.": 1,
    "It's an independent newspaper.": 1,
    " tell that to the people in charge.": 1,
    "They think that if there's anything against them, then we are being an opposition newspaper in very, very difficult times.": 1,
    " Some of my reporters were arrested.": 1,
    "We had some court cases.": 1,
    "My father was assassinated.": 1,
    "Today we are in a much better situation.": 1,
    "We've created the credibility.": 1,
    " And in times of revolution or change like today, it is very important for independent media to have a voice.": 1,
    "It's very important for you to go to YemenTimes.com.": 1,
    " And it's very important to listen to our voice.": 1,
    "And this is probably something I want to share with you on Western media probably and how": 1,
    " There's a lot of stereotypes thinking of Yemen in one single frame.": 1,
    "This is what Yemen is all about.": 1,
    "And that's not fair.": 1,
    " It's not fair for me, it's not fair for my country.": 1,
    "A lot of reporters come to Yemen and they want to write a story on Al-Qaeda or terrorism and I just wanted to share with you like there's one reporter that came, he wanted to do a documentary on": 1,
    " what his editors wanted and he landed up writing about a story that even surprised me, hip hop.": 1,
    " that there are young Yemeni men who express themselves through dancing.": 1,
    " That thing.": 1,
    "Rap.": 1,
    "Break dancing.": 1,
    "Yeah, break dancing.": 1,
    "I'm not so old.": 1,
    " I'm just not in touch.": 1,
    " Yes, you are.": 1,
    " Actually, that's a documentary that's available online.": 1,
    "The video's online.": 1,
    "It is.": 1,
    "ShakeTheDust.org, yeah.": 1,
    "ShakeTheDust.": 1,
    "ShakeTheDust.org, and it definitely does give a different image of Yemen.": 1,
    " You spoke about the responsibility of the press and certainly when we look at the ways in which we have": 1,
    " you know, separated ourselves from others.": 1,
    "We've created fear and danger often from lack of knowledge, lack of real understanding.": 1,
    "How do you see the way that the": 1,
    " Western press in particular is covering this and all other stories out of the region, but in particular in your country.": 1,
    "Well, there is a saying that says you fear what you don't know and you hate what you fear.": 1,
    " So it's about the lack of research basically.": 1,
    "It's almost do your homework, you know, some involvement and you cannot do what parachute reporting, you know, just jump into a country for two days and": 1,
    " think that you've done your homework and stories.": 1,
    "So I wish that the world would know my Yemen, my country.": 1,
    " my people.": 1,
    "I am an example and there are others like me.": 1,
    "We may not be that many, but if we are promoted as a good positive example, there will be others, men and women, who can": 1,
    " eventually bridge the gap again coming to the bridge between Yemen and the world and telling us first about recognition and then about communication and compassion.": 1,
    " I think Yemen is going to be in very bad situation in the next two or three years.": 1,
    "It's natural.": 1,
    "But after the two years, which is the price we are willing to pay,": 1,
    " we were going to stand up again on our feet but in the new Yemen with the younger and more empowered people.": 1,
    "Democratic.": 1,
    " Nadia, I think you've just given us a very different view of Yemen.": 1,
    "And certainly you yourself and what you do have given us a view of the future that we will embrace.": 1,
    " and be grateful for.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    "And the very best of luck to you.": 1,
