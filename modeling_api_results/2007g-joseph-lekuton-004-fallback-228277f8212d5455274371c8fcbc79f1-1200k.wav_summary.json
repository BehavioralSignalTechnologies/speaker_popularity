    " My name is Dosev, a member of parliament in Kenya and picture Amasai village in one evening.": 1,
    " Government soldiers come, surround the village and ask each elder to bring one boy to school.": 1,
    "That's how I went to school.": 1,
    "Pretty much a government guy pointing a gun and told my father, you have to make a choice.": 1,
    " So I worked very comfortably to this missionary school that was run by American missionary.": 1,
    "And the first thing the American missionary gave me was a candy.": 1,
    "I had never in my life ever tasted candy.": 1,
    "So I said to myself, with all these hundred other boys, this is where I belong.": 1,
    " Stayed.": 1,
    "When everybody else was dropping out, my family moved, we were nomads.": 1,
    "Every time school closed, it was a boarding school when I was seven, you had to travel until you find them.": 1,
    "50 miles, 40 miles, it doesn't matter, you sleep in the bush, but you kept going.": 1,
    " And I stayed.": 1,
    "I don't know why I stayed, but I stayed.": 1,
    "And all of a sudden, I passed the national examination, found myself in a very beautiful high school in Kenya.": 1,
    " After I finished high school, I just walking and found a man who gave me a full scholarship to the United States.": 1,
    "My mother still lives in a cow dung hut.": 1,
    "None of my brothers have gone to school.": 1,
    "And this man told me, here, go.": 1,
    " So I got a scholarship to St.": 1,
    "Lawrence University of New York.": 1,
    "Finish that.": 1,
    " And then after that I went to Harvard graduate school, finished that, and then I worked in DC a little bit.": 1,
    "I wrote the book Financial Geographic and taught US History.": 1,
    "And every time I kept going back home,": 1,
    " listening to the problems of these people, sick people, people with no water, all this stuff.": 1,
    "And every time I go back to America, I kept thinking about them.": 1,
    "Then one day, an elder gave me a story.": 1,
    "And this story went like this.": 1,
    " Long time ago, there was a big war between tribes.": 1,
    "And there was this specific tribe that was really afraid of this other larger tribe.": 1,
    "And every time they sent scouts out there to make sure no one attacked them.": 1,
    " So one day the scouts came running and told the villagers the enemies are coming only half an hour away, they'll be here.": 1,
    "So people scrambled, took their things and ready to go, move out.": 1,
    " And by the two men, one man was blind, one man had no legs.": 1,
    "He was born like that.": 1,
    "So the villagers, the leader of the chief said, no, sorry, we can't take you.": 1,
    "You slow us down.": 1,
    "We have to feed our children, women and children.": 1,
    "We have to run.": 1,
    " and they are left behind, waiting to die.": 1,
    "But these two people": 1,
    " walked something out.": 1,
    "The blind man said, look, I'm a very strong man, but I can't see.": 1,
    "The man in the old leg says, I can see as far as the end of the world, but I can't save myself from a cat or even an elf, whatever animals.": 1,
    " So this man, the blind man, went down on his knees, down like this, and told the man with no legs to go over his back.": 1,
    "He stood up.": 1,
    "The man on top can see.": 1,
    "The blind man can walk.": 1,
    " And these guys took off, followed the foots of the villagers until they found and passed them.": 1,
    " So, this was told to me in a set up of elders and you know, it's really poor area.": 1,
    "I represent Northern Kenya.": 1,
    "Most nomadic, remote areas you can even find.": 1,
    " And that man told me, so here you are, you've got a good education for America, you have a good life in America, what are you gonna do for us?": 1,
    " We want you to be our eyes.": 1,
    "We'll give you the legs.": 1,
    "We'll walk you, you lead us.": 1,
    " So the opportunity came as always thinking about that.": 1,
    "What can I do to help my people?": 1,
    "Every time you go to an area where for 43 years of independence, we still don't have basic health facilities.": 1,
    "A man has to be transported in a wheelbarrow to 20, 30 kilometers from the hospital.": 1,
    "No clean drinking water.": 1,
    " So I said I'm going to dedicate myself, I'm leaving America, I'm going to run for office.": 1,
    "So last July I moved from America in June, ran in July election and won.": 1,
    " and I came for them and that's my goal and right now I have in place for the last nine months": 1,
    " A plan that in five years, every nomad will have clean drinking water.": 1,
    "We're building dispensers across that constituency.": 1,
    " I'm asking my friends from America to help with bringing nurses or doctors to help us out.": 1,
    "I'm trying to improve infrastructure.": 1,
    "I'm using the knowledge I received from the United States and from my community.": 1,
    " to move them forward.": 1,
    "I'm trying to develop homegrown solutions to our issues.": 1,
    "As you know, we realize that people outside can come and help us.": 1,
    "But if we don't help ourselves, there's nothing we can do.": 1,
    " So my plan right now is, as I continue with, introducing students to different fields.": 1,
    "Some become doctors, some lawyers.": 1,
    "We want to produce a comprehensive group of people.": 1,
    " students who can come back and help us see a community grow that is in the middle of a huge economic recession.": 1,
    "So as I continue to be a member of parliament,": 1,
    " And I continue listening to all of you talking about botany, talking about health, talking about democracy, talking about new inventions.": 1,
    "I'm hoping that one day, in my own little community, which is 26,000 square kilometers, maybe five times the size of Royal Island,": 1,
    " with no roads, would be able to become a model.": 1,
    " to help others develop.": 1,
    "Thank you very much": 1
