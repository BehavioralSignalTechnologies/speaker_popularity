    " I'll just take you to Bangladesh for a minute.": 1,

    "Atto matto foga dinen.": 1,

    "Tupi fallegh ben ikana ona.": 1,
    " to fill their own private dreams of staying in town with a mere endurance.": 1,
    "This is where the journey begins with one small step, a journey that today has reached one million destinations.": 1,
    " with loans for people to buy cell phones, entire villages are being brought into the information age.": 1,
    "I want people throughout the world to know this story.": 1,
    " Before I tell that story, we should ask ourselves the question, why does poverty exist?": 1,
    "I mean, there's plenty of knowledge.": 1,
    " scientific breakthroughs, we all live in the same planet, but still there's a great deal of poverty in the world.": 1,
    "And I think": 1,
    " So I want to throw a perspective that I have so that we can assess this project or any other project for that matter to see whether it's contributing or": 1,
    " contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it.": 1,
    "Rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years.": 1,
    "By and large, this has failed.": 1,
    "You can see this book.": 1,
    " written by someone who worked in the World Bank for 20 years.": 1,
    "And he finds economic growth in this country to be elusive.": 1,
    "By and large, it did not work.": 1,
    "So the question is, why is that?": 1,
    " In my mind, there's something to learn from the history of Europe.": 1,
    "I mean, even here, yesterday I was walking across the street and they showed": 1,
    " Three bishops were executed 500 years ago right across the street from here.": 1,
    "So my point is there's a lot of struggle has gone in Europe.": 1,
    " There were citizens who were empowered by technologies and they demanded authorities to come down from their high horses.": 1,
    " And in the end, there's better bargaining between the authorities and citizens, and democracies, capitalism, everything else flourished.": 1,
    " And so you can see the real process and this is backed up by this 500 page book that the authorities came down and citizens got up.": 1,
    " But if you have that perspective, then you can see what happened in the last 60 years.": 1,
    "AID actually did the opposite.": 1,
    " It empowered authorities and as a result marginalized citizens.": 1,
    "The authorities did not have the reason to make": 1,
    " economic growth happened so that they could tax people and make more money to run their business.": 1,
    "Because they were getting it from abroad.": 1,
    " And in fact, if you see oil rich countries where citizens are not yet empowered, the same thing goes.": 1,
    "Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, all sorts of countries, because the aid and oil or mineral money": 1,
    " acts the same way.": 1,
    "It empowers authorities without activating the citizens, their hands, legs, brains, what have you.": 1,
    " And if you agree with that, then I think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize that economic development is of the people, by the people, for the people.": 1,
    " And that is the real network effect.": 1,
    "If citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive so that their voices are heard, so then things would improve.": 1,
    " And to contrast that, you can see the most important institution in the world, the World Bank, is an organization of the government, by the government, for the governments.": 1,
    "Just see the contrast.": 1,
    "And that is the perspective I have.": 1,
    " And then I can start my story.": 1,
    "Of course, how would you empower citizens?": 1,
    "There could be all sorts of technologies.": 1,
    " and one is cell phones.": 1,
    "Recently, the economists recognized this, but I stumbled upon the idea 12 years ago, and that's what I've been working on.": 1,
    " So 12 years ago, I was trying to be an investment banker in New York.": 1,
    "We had quite a few of our colleagues were connected by a computer network.": 1,
    " We got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks.": 1,
    "We could update each other more often.": 1,
    " But one time it broke down, and it reminded me of a day in 1971.": 1,
    "There was a war going on in my country, and my family moved out of an urban place where we used to live to a remote rural area.": 1,
    " where it was safer.": 1,
    "And one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling.": 1,
    "And I walked 10 miles or so all morning to get there.": 1,
    " to the medicine man, and he wasn't there, so I walked all afternoon back.": 1,
    "So I had another unproductive day.": 1,
    "So while I was sitting in a tall building in New York, I put those two experiences together side by side.": 1,
    " and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity, whether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village.": 1,
    " So naturally, the implication of that is that a telephone is a weapon against poverty.": 1,
    "And if that's the case, then the question is how many telephones did we have at that time?": 1,
    " And it turns out that there was one telephone in Bangladesh for every 500 people.": 1,
    "And all those phones were in its few urban places.": 1,
    "The vast rural areas where 100 million people lived, there were no telephones.": 1,
    " So just imagine how many man-months or man-years are wasted, just like I wasted a day.": 1,
    "If you just multiply by 100 million people, let's say losing one day a month, whatever.": 1,
    " And you'll see a vast amount of resource wasted.": 1,
    "And after all, poor countries, like rich countries, one thing we got equal is that days are same length, 24 hours.": 1,
    " that precious resource where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries, that's a huge waste.": 1,
    " So I started looking for any evidence that it does connectivity really increase productivity.": 1,
    "And I couldn't find much really, but I found this graph.": 1,
    " produced by the ITU, which is the International Telecommunication Union, based in Geneva, they show an interesting thing, that you see the horizontal axis is where you place your country.": 1,
    " So the United States or the UK would be here, outside.": 1,
    "And so the impact of one new telephone, which is on the vertical axis, is very little.": 1,
    " But if you come back to a poorer country where the GNP per capita is, let's say, $500 or $300, then the impact is huge, $6,000.": 1,
    " or $5,000.": 1,
    "The question was, how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh?": 1,
    "It turns out $2,000.": 1,
    "So if you spend $2,000,": 1,
    " And let's say the telephone lasts 10 years, and it's $5,000 every year.": 1,
    "So that's $50,000.": 1,
    "So obviously this was a gadget to have.": 1,
    " And of course, if the cost of installing a telephone is going down because there's a digital revolution going on, then it would be even more dramatic.": 1,
    " And I knew little economics by then.": 1,
    "It says, Adam Smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity.": 1,
    " But how would you specialize?": 1,
    "Let's say I'm a fisherman and a farmer, and Chris is a fisherman and farmer, both are generalists.": 1,
    " The point is that the only way we could depend on each other is if we can connect with each other.": 1,
    " And if we are neighbors, I could just walk over to his house, but then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area.": 1,
    " But in order to expand that, you need a river, or you need a highway, or you need telephone lines.": 1,
    "But in any event, it's connectivity that leads to dependability, and that leads to specialization, that leads to productivity.": 1,
    " So the question was, I started looking at this issue and going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York.": 1,
    " reasons people told me why we don't have enough telephones.": 1,
    "And one of them is the lacking buying power.": 1,
    "Poor people apparently don't have the power to buy.": 1,
    "But the point is, if it's a production tool, why do we have to worry about that?": 1,
    " I mean, in America, people buy cars and they put very little money down.": 1,
    "They get a car and they go to work.": 1,
    "The work pays them a salary.": 1,
    "The salary allows them to pay for the car over time.": 1,
    "The car pays for itself.": 1,
    " So if telephone is a production tool, then we don't quite have to worry about the purchasing power.": 1,
    "And of course, even if that's true, then what about initial buying power?": 1,
    " So then the question is, why can't we have some kind of shared access?": 1,
    "In the United States, everybody needs a banking service, but very few of us are trying to buy a bank.": 1,
    " So a bank tends to serve a whole community.": 1,
    "So we could do that for telephones.": 1,
    "And also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet.": 1,
    "Food, clothing, shelter, whatever.": 1,
    " But again, it's very paternalistic.": 1,
    "You should be raising income and let people decide what they want to do with their money.": 1,
    " But the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures.": 1,
    "See, you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing.": 1,
    "For instance, the internet was booming in the U.S.": 1,
    " because people had computers, they had modems, they had telephone lines, so it's very easy to bring in a new idea like the internet.": 1,
    " But that's what's lacking in a poor country.": 1,
    "So, for example, we didn't have ways to have credit checks, few banks to collect bills, etc.": 1,
    "But that's why I noticed Grameen Bank, which is a bank for poor people.": 1,
    " and had 1,100 branches, 12,000 employees, 2.3 million borrowers.": 1,
    "And these branches I thought I could put cell towers and create a network.": 1,
    " And anyway, to cut the time short, I first went to them and said, you know, perhaps I could connect all your branches and make you more efficient.": 1,
    " But, you know, they have, after all, evolved in a country without telephones, so they are decentralized.": 1,
    "I mean, of course, there might be other good reasons, but this was one of the reasons.": 1,
    "There had to be.": 1,
    " And so they were not that interested to connect all their branches and rock the boat.": 1,
    "So I started focusing, what is it that they really do?": 1,
    "So what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank.": 1,
    " She typically buys a cow.": 1,
    "The cow gives milk, and she sells the milk to the villagers and pays off the loan.": 1,
    "And this is a business for her, but it's milk for everybody else.": 1,
    "And suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow.": 1,
    " because she could borrow $200 from the bank, get a phone, and have the phone for everybody, and it's a business for her.": 1,
    "So I wrote to the bank and": 1,
    " They thought for a while and they said, it's a little crazy but logical.": 1,
    "If you think it can be done, come and make it happen.": 1,
    " So I quit my job, I went back to Bangladesh, I created a company in America called GonoPhone, which in Bengali means people's phone.": 1,
    " And angel investors in America put in money into that.": 1,
    "I flew around the world.": 1,
    "After about a million, I mean, I got rejected from lots of places because I was not only trying to go to a poor country, I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country.": 1,
    " After about a million miles and substantial loss of hair, I eventually put together a": 1,
    " consortium which involved the Norwegian telephone company which provided the know-how and the Grameen Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service.": 1,
    " To make the story short, here is the coverage of the country.": 1,
    "You can see it's pretty much covered.": 1,
    "Even in Bangladesh, there are some empty places.": 1,
    "But we're also investing another $300 million this year.": 1,
    " to extend that coverage.": 1,
    "Now that cow model I talked about, there are about 115,000 people": 1,
    " who are retailing telephone services in their neighborhoods.": 1,
    "And it's serving 52,000 villages, which represent about 80 million people.": 1,
    " And these phones are generating about $100 million for the company, and $2 profit per entrepreneur per day, which is like $700 per year.": 1,
    " And of course, it's very beneficial in a lot of ways.": 1,
    "It increases income, improves welfare, etc.": 1,
    " The result is right now this company is the largest telephone company with 3.5 million subscribers, 115,000 of these phones I talked about, that produces about a third of the traffic in the network.": 1,
    " And 2004, the net profit after taxes, very serious taxes, was $120 million.": 1,
    "And the company contributed about $190 million to the government coffers.": 1,
    " And again, here are some of the lessons the government needs to provide economically viable services.": 1,
    "Actually, this is an instance where private companies can...": 1,
    " provide that.": 1,
    "Governments need to subsidize private companies.": 1,
    "This is what some people think.": 1,
    "And actually private companies help governments with taxes.": 1,
    " Poor people are recipients, poor people are a resource.": 1,
    "Services cost too much for the poor, their involvement reduces the cost.": 1,
    " The poor are uneducated and cannot do much.": 1,
    "They are very eager learners and very capable survivors.": 1,
    "I have been very surprised.": 1,
    "Most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day.": 1,
    " Poor countries need aid.": 1,
    "Businesses, this one company has raised, if the ITU figures are even 5% true, this one company is raising the GNP of the country.": 1,
    " much more than the aid the country receives.": 1,
    "And as I was trying to show you, as far as I'm concerned, aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens.": 1,
    " And this is a new project I have with Dean Kamen, the famous inventor in America.": 1,
    "He has produced": 1,
    " power generators, which we are now doing an experiment in Bangladesh in two villages where cow manure is producing biogas, which is running these generators, and each of these generators": 1,
    " is selling electricity to 20 households each.": 1,
    "It's just an experiment, we don't know how far it will go, but it's going on.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
