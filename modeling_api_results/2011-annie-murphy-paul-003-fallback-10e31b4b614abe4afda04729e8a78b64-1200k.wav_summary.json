    " My subject today is learning.": 1,
    "And in that spirit, I want to spring on you all a pop quiz.": 1,
    "Ready?": 1,
    "When does learning begin?": 1,
    " Now, as you ponder that question, maybe you're thinking about the first day of preschool or kindergarten, the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher.": 1,
    " Or maybe you've called to mind the toddler phase when children are learning how to walk and talk and use a fork.": 1,
    " Maybe you've encountered the zero to three movement, which asserts that the most important years for learning are the earliest ones.": 1,
    "And so your answer to my question would be learning begins at birth.": 1,
    " Well, today I want to present to you an idea that may be surprising.": 1,
    " that may even seem implausible, but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology.": 1,
    "And that is that some of the most important learning we ever do happens before we're born, while we're still in the womb.": 1,
    " Now, I'm a science reporter, I write books and magazine articles, and I'm also a mother.": 1,
    " And those two roles came together for me in a book that I wrote called Origins.": 1,
    "Origins is a report from the front lines of an exciting new field called Fetal Origins.": 1,
    " Fetal origins is a scientific discipline that emerged just about two decades ago.": 1,
    " and it's based on the theory that our health and well-being throughout our lives is crucially affected by the nine months we spend in the womb.": 1,
    " Now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me.": 1,
    "I was myself pregnant while I was doing the research for the book.": 1,
    " And one of the most fascinating insights I took from this work is that we're all learning about the world even before we enter it.": 1,
    " when we hold our babies for the first time, we might imagine that they're clean slates unmarked by life.": 1,
    " when in fact they've already been shaped by us and by the particular world we live in.": 1,
    "Today I want to share with you some of the amazing things that scientists are discovering": 1,
    " about what fetuses learn while they're still in their mother's bellies.": 1,
    " First of all, they learn the sound of their mother's voices.": 1,
    " because sounds from the outside world have to travel through the mother's abdominal tissue and through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus.": 1,
    " The voices fetuses here, starting around the fourth month of gestation, are muted and muffled.": 1,
    "One researcher says that they probably sound a lot like the voice of Charlie Brown's teacher in the old Peanuts cartoon.": 1,
    " But the pregnant woman's own voice reverberates through her body, reaching the fetus much more readily.": 1,
    "And because the fetus is with her all the time, it hears her voice a lot.": 1,
    " Once the baby's born, it recognizes her voice, and it prefers listening to her voice over anyone else's.": 1,
    "How can we know this?": 1,
    "Newborn babies can't do much, but one thing they're really good at is sucking.": 1,
    " Researchers take advantage of this fact by rigging up two rubber nipples so that if a baby sucks on one, it hears a recording of its mother's voice on a pair of headphones, and if it sucks on the other nipple, it hears": 1,
    " a recording of a female stranger's voice.": 1,
    "Babies quickly show their preference by choosing the first one.": 1,
    " Scientists also take advantage of the fact that babies will slow down their sucking when something interests them, and resume their fast sucking when they get bored.": 1,
    " This is how researchers discovered that after women repeatedly read aloud a section of Dr. Seuss's The Cat in the Hat while they were pregnant, their newborn babies recognized that passage when they heard it outside the womb.": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1,
    " My favorite experiment of this kind is the one that showed that the babies of women who watched a certain soap opera every day during pregnancy recognized the theme song of that show once they were born.": 1,
    " So, fetuses are even learning about the particular language that's spoken in the world that they'll be born into.": 1,
    "A study published last year": 1,
    " found that from birth, from the moment of birth, babies cry in the accent of their mother's native language.": 1,
    " French babies' cries end on a rising note while German babies end on a falling note, imitating the melodic contours of those languages.": 1,
    " Now, why would this kind of fetal learning be useful?": 1,
    "It may have evolved to aid the baby's survival.": 1,
    "From the moment of birth, the baby responds most to the voice of the person who is most likely to care for it, its mother.": 1,
    " It even makes its cries sound like the mother's language, which may further endear the baby to the mother and which may give the baby a head start in the critical task of learning how to understand and speak its native language.": 1,
    " But it's not just sounds that fetuses are learning about in utero, it's also tastes and smells.": 1,
    " By seven months of gestation, the fetus' taste buds are fully developed, and its olfactory receptors, which allow it to smell, are functioning.": 1,
    " The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid, which is continuously swallowed by the fetus.": 1,
    "Babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes once they're out in the world.": 1,
    " In one experiment, a group of pregnant women was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice during their third trimester of pregnancy, while another group of pregnant women drank only water.": 1,
    " Six months later, the women's infants were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice, and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it.": 1,
    " The offspring of the carrot juice drinking women ate more carrot flavored cereal and from the looks of it they seemed to enjoy it more.": 1,
    " A sort of French version of this experiment was carried out in Dijon, France, where researchers found that mothers who consumed food and drink flavored with licorice-flavored anise": 1,
    " during pregnancy showed a preference for anus on their first day of life and again when they were tested later on their fourth day of life.": 1,
    " Babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy showed a reaction that translated roughly as yuck.": 1,
    " What this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat.": 1,
    "Fetuses are also being taught about the particular culture that they'll be joining.": 1,
    " through one of culture's most powerful expressions, which is food.": 1,
    "They're being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices of their culture's cuisine even before birth.": 1,
    " Now, it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons.": 1,
    "But before I get to that, I want to address something that you may be wondering about.": 1,
    " The notion of fetal learning may conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus, like playing Mozart through headphones placed on a pregnant belly.": 1,
    " But actually the nine month long process of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb is a lot more visceral and consequential than that.": 1,
    " much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life, the air she breathes, the food and drink she consumes.": 1,
    " The chemicals she's exposed to, even the emotions she feels, are shared in some fashion with her fetus.": 1,
    "They make up a mix of influences as individual and idiosyncratic as the woman herself.": 1,
    " The fetus incorporates these offerings into its own body, makes them part of its flesh and blood, and often it does something more.": 1,
    " It treats these maternal contributions as information, as what I like to call biological postcards from the world outside.": 1,
    " So what a fetus is learning about in utero is not Mozart's magic flute, but answers to questions much more critical to its survival.": 1,
    "Will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity?": 1,
    " Will it be safe and protected or will it face constant dangers and threats?": 1,
    "Will it live a long, fruitful life or a short, harried one?": 1,
    " The pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted to the wind.": 1,
    " the resulting tuning and tweaking of a fetus's brain and other organs, are part of what give us humans our enormous flexibility, our ability to thrive.": 1,
    " in a huge variety of environments, from the country to the city, from the tundra to the desert.": 1,
    "To conclude, I want to tell you two stories about how mothers teach their children about the world even before they're born.": 1,
    " In the autumn of 1944, the darkest days of World War II, German troops blockaded Western Holland.": 1,
    " turning away all shipments of food.": 1,
    "The opening of the Nazi's siege was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades.": 1,
    "So cold, the water and the canals froze solid.": 1,
    " Soon food became scarce, with many Dutch surviving on just 500 calories a day, a quarter of what they consumed before the war.": 1,
    "As weeks of deprivation stretched into months, some resorted to eating tulip bulbs.": 1,
    " By the beginning of May, the nation's carefully rationed food reserve was completely exhausted.": 1,
    "The specter of mass starvation loomed.": 1,
    "And then, on May 5th, 1945, the siege came to a sudden end when Holland": 1,
    " was liberated by the Allies.": 1,
    " The hunger winter, as it came to be known, killed some 10,000 people and weakened thousands more.": 1,
    "But there was another population that was affected, the 40,000 fetuses in utero during the siege.": 1,
    " Some of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy were immediately apparent in higher rates of stillbirths, birth defects, low birth weights, and infant mortality.": 1,
    "But others wouldn't be discovered for many years.": 1,
    " Decades after the hunger winter, researchers documented that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege": 1,
    " have more obesity, more diabetes, and more heart disease in later life than individuals who are gestated under normal conditions.": 1,
    " These individuals' prenatal experience of starvation seems to have changed their bodies in myriad ways.": 1,
    " They have higher blood pressure, poorer cholesterol profiles, and reduced glucose tolerance, a precursor of diabetes.": 1,
    " Why would undernutrition in the womb result in disease later?": 1,
    "One explanation is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation.": 1,
    " When food is scarce, they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ, the brain, and away from other organs like the heart and liver.": 1,
    " This keeps the fetus alive in the short term, but the bill comes due later on in life when those other organs, deprived early on, become more susceptible to disease.": 1,
    " But that may not be all that's going on.": 1,
    "It seems that fetuses are taking cues from the intrauterine environment and tailoring their physiology accordingly.": 1,
    "They're preparing themselves for the kind of world they will encounter on the other side of the womb.": 1,
    " The fetus adjusts its metabolism and other physiological processes in anticipation of the environment that awaits it.": 1,
    " And the basis of the fetus's prediction is what its mother eats.": 1,
    "The meals a pregnant woman consumes constitute a kind of story, a fairy tale of abundance or a grim chronicle of deprivation.": 1,
    " This story imparts information that the fetus uses to organize its body and its systems, an adaptation to prevailing circumstances that facilitates its future survival.": 1,
    " Faced with severely limited resources, a smaller-sized child with reduced energy requirements will, in fact, have a better chance of living to adulthood.": 1,
    " The real trouble comes when pregnant women are, in a sense, unreliable narrators, when fetuses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty.": 1,
    " This is what happened to the children of the Dutch Hunger Winter, and their higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease are the result.": 1,
    " Bodies that were built to hang on to every calorie found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories of the post-war Western diet.": 1,
    "The world they had learned about while in utero was not the same as the world into which they were born.": 1,
    " Here's another story.": 1,
    " At 8.46am on September 11th, 2001, there were tens of thousands of people in the vicinity of the World Trade Center in New York.": 1,
    " Commuters spilling off trains, waitresses setting tables for the morning rush, brokers already working the phones on Wall Street.": 1,
    "1,700 of these people were pregnant women.": 1,
    " When the plane struck and the towers collapsed, many of these women experienced the same horrors inflicted on other survivors of the disaster.": 1,
    "The overwhelming chaos and confusion.": 1,
    " the rolling clouds of potentially toxic dust and debris, the heart-pounding fear for their lives.": 1,
    " About a year after 9-11, researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack.": 1,
    " In the babies of those women who developed post-traumatic stress syndrome or PTSD following their ordeal, researchers discovered a biological marker of susceptibility to PTSD, an effect that was most pronounced": 1,
    " in infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe in their third trimester.": 1,
    "In other words, the mothers with post-traumatic stress syndrome": 1,
    " had passed on a vulnerability to the condition to their children while they were still in utero.": 1,
    " Now consider this, post-traumatic stress syndrome appears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong, causing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering.": 1,
    "But there's another way of thinking about PTSD.": 1,
    " What looks like pathology to us may actually be a useful adaptation in some circumstances.": 1,
    "In a particularly dangerous environment, the characteristic manifestations of PTSD": 1,
    " a hyper awareness of one's surroundings, a quick trigger response to danger could save someone's life.": 1,
    " The notion that the prenatal transmission of PTSD risk is adaptive is still speculative, but I find it rather poignant.": 1,
    " It would mean that even before birth, mothers are warning their children that it's a wild world out there, telling them, be careful.": 1,
    " Let me be clear, fetal origins research is not about blaming women for what happens during pregnancy.": 1,
    "It's about discovering how best to promote the health and well-being of the next generation.": 1,
    " That important effort must include a focus on what fetuses learn during the nine months they spend in the womb.": 1,
    " Learning is one of life's most essential activities, and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
