    "Watashi wa omocha no kaihatsha desu.": 1,
    "Mita koto mo nai, atarashii omocha wo tsukuritai to iu yume wo motte, ky\u016bnen mae ni omocha gaisha ni hairimashita.": 1,
    " When I first joined the company, I thought about a lot of new ideas every day and suggested them to my boss.": 1,
    "But he always said, Do you have the data to sell this?": 1,
    "Think about the product by analyzing market data.": 1,
    " Data, data, data.": 1,
    "So I analyzed the ground data and came up with the product.": 1,
    "Suddenly, I couldn't think of anything new.": 1,
    " The only thing that came out was something similar.": 1,
    "Gradually, I couldn't come up with any ideas.": 1,
    "I didn't even want to think about it.": 1,
    "It was painful.": 1,
    "In the end, I lost so much weight.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " I think you all have similar feelings and experiences.": 1,
    "Your boss suffers, your data suffers, and you don't want to think about it anymore.": 1,
    "Right now, I've thrown away my data.": 1,
    " It's a dream to make a new toy.": 1,
    "And now, instead, I'm thinking of an idea using a game called Shiritori.": 1,
    "Today, I would like to introduce this idea.": 1,
    "What is Shiritori?": 1,
    " It's a game where you say the last word in the order you put it on your head.": 1,
    "It's the same in both Japanese and English.": 1,
    "You can freely play this game.": 1,
    "Cat, Coke, Live, Brush.": 1,
    " There are a lot of random words.": 1,
    "You force yourself to connect those words to the things you want to think of and come up with ideas.": 1,
    "For example, in my case, what I want to think of is a toy, so what is a cat toy?": 1,
    " This toy will spin and land from a high place.": 1,
    "What is this Cola toy?": 1,
    " It's a toy that shoots the cola with a gun and makes the other person sick.": 1,
    "It's a silly idea.": 1,
    "You can keep making it up.": 1,
    "The more ideas you come up with, the better ideas you'll get.": 1,
    " For example, can you make a toothbrush into a toy?": 1,
    "For example, can you combine a toothbrush and a guitar to make a toy that can be played while polishing?": 1,
    " I don't think kids who don't like brushing teeth will like brushing their teeth.": 1,
    " I wondered if I could make a hat into a toy.": 1,
    "Like a Russian roulette, I wore a hat one by one, and at the moment someone wore it, I broke my head and a violent alien came out.": 1,
    " I don't think it's important to have a home party.": 1,
    "If you stare at the data, you'll come up with ideas that will never come up.": 1,
    " This is actually a toy that is wrapped in something that is easy to break.": 1,
    " Mugen Puchi Puchi is a toy that you can play with your fingers as much as you want.": 1,
    "It was a big hit.": 1,
    "It has nothing to do with the data.": 1,
    " This is just for fun, but it's going to be a great time to have fun, so please let everyone at the venue play with it today.": 1,
    " Anyway, I keep coming up with stupid ideas.": 1,
    "I keep coming up with stupid ideas.": 1,
    "Based on analysis, if you know what you're aiming for, you won't be able to come up with new ideas that you aim for too much.": 1,
    " Even if you know what you're aiming for, you can close your eyes and throw darts.": 1,
    "You can freely think of an idea.": 1,
    "Then you'll definitely hit somewhere close to the center.": 1,
    "Just one.": 1,
    " You choose that.": 1,
    "Then that idea has a need and becomes a new idea.": 1,
    " That's the way to do it.": 1,
    "You can do it in many ways, even if you don't know how to do it.": 1,
    "You just need to collect random words.": 1,
    "You can randomly collect words by turning the dictionary upside down.": 1,
    " For example, you can search for two characters and collect the results.": 1,
    "Or you can go to the store and add the name of the product to whatever you want to think of.": 1,
    " Instead of gathering the information of the genre you want to think of, you should gather random words.": 1,
    "By doing so, you will be able to come up with a series of materials in your head, and you will be able to come up with various ideas.": 1,
    " The biggest advantage of this method is the continuity of the image.": 1,
    "Because we think about the words in order, the image of the words that we were thinking about before remains.": 1,
    "It will automatically be connected one after another.": 1,
    " Unconsciously, the live and the brush are connected, and the roulette and the hat are connected.": 1,
    "You don't even notice it, and you come up with an idea you don't even think of.": 1,
    " This method is useful not only for toys, but also for books, apps, and events.": 1,
    "I hope you try it out.": 1,
    " There is also a future that is born from data.": 1,
    "However, I am looking forward to creating an exciting future that you can't even imagine from this endless play called Shiritori.": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1
