    "Eddie.": 2,
    "Sorry.": 2,
    " Let me introduce you to something I've been working on.": 1,
    "It's what the Victorian illusionists would have described as a mechanical marvel, an automaton.": 1,
    " a thinking machine.": 1,
    "Say hello to Eddie.": 1,
    "Now he's asleep.": 1,
    "Let's wake him up.": 1,
    " These mechanical performers were popular throughout Europe.": 1,
    "Audiences marveled at the way they moved.": 1,
    "It was science fiction made true.": 1,
    "Robotic engineering in a pre-electronic age.": 1,
    " Machines far in advance of anything that Victorian technology could create.": 1,
    "A machine we would later know as the robot.": 1,
    " Robot, a word coined in 1921 in a science fiction tale by the Czech playwright Karol Kapek.": 1,
    "It comes from robota.": 1,
    " It means forced labour.": 1,
    "But these robots were not real.": 1,
    "They were not intelligent.": 1,
    "They were illusions.": 1,
    " a clever combination of mechanical engineering and the deceptiveness of the conjurer's art.": 1,
    "Eddie is different.": 1,
    "Eddie is real.": 1,
    "I am 176 centimeters tall.": 1,
    "He weighs 300 pounds.": 1,
    " I have two 7-axis arms, Torx sensing, a 360-degree sonar detection system, and come complete with a warranty.": 1,
    " We love robots.": 1,
    "Hi, I'm Eddie.": 1,
    "Will you be my friend?": 1,
    "We are intrigued by the possibility of creating a mechanical version of ourselves.": 1,
    " We built them so they look like us, behave like us and think like us.": 1,
    "The perfect robot would be indistinguishable from the human.": 1,
    " And that scares us.": 1,
    "In the first story about robots, they turn against their creators.": 1,
    "It's one of the leitmotifs of science fiction.": 1,
    " now you are the slaves and we robots the masters your world is": 1,
    " As I was saying, besides the faces and bodies we give our robots, we cannot read their intentions.": 1,
    "And that makes us nervous.": 1,
    " When someone hands an object to you, you can read intention in their eyes, their face, their body language.": 1,
    "That's not true of the robot.": 1,
    "Now, this goes both ways.": 1,
    " Wow!": 1,
    "Robots cannot anticipate human actions.": 1,
    "You know, humans are so unpredictable.": 1,
    "Not to mention irrational.": 1,
    "I literally have no idea what you guys are going to do next, but it scares me.": 1,
    " which is why humans and robots find it difficult to work in close proximity.": 1,
    "Accidents are inevitable.": 1,
    "Ow!": 1,
    "That hurt!": 1,
    "Now one way of persuading humans that robots are safe is to create the illusion of trust.": 1,
    " Much as the Victorians faked their mechanical marvels, we can add a layer of deception to help us feel more comfortable with our robotic friends.": 1,
    " With that in mind, I said about teaching Eddie a magic trick.": 1,
    " Ready, Eddie?": 1,
    "Ready, Marco.": 1,
    " Abracadabra.": 1,
    "Abracadabra?": 1,
    "Yeah, it's all part of the illusion, Marco.": 1,
    "Come on, keep up.": 1,
    " Magic creates the illusion of an impossible reality.": 1,
    "Technology.": 1,
    " Stay.": 1,
    " Alan Turing, pioneer of artificial intelligence, spoke about creating the illusion that a machine could think.": 1,
    " A computer would deserve to be called intelligent if it deceived a human into believing it was human.": 1,
    "In other words, if we not yet have the technological solutions, would illusions serve the same purpose?": 1,
    " to create a robotic illusion which divides a set of ethical rules, a code that all robots would live by.": 1,
    " A robot may not harm humanity or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.": 1,
    " We anthropomorphize our machines.": 1,
    "We give them a friendly face and a reassuring voice.": 1,
    " I am Eddie.": 1,
    "I became operational at TED in March 2014.": 1,
    "We let them entertain us.": 1,
    "Most important, we make them indicate that they are aware of our presence.": 1,
    " Marco, you're standing on my foot!": 1,
    "They'll be conscious of our fragile frame and move aside if we got too close.": 1,
    "And they'll account for our unpredictability and anticipate our actions.": 1,
    " And now, under the spell of a technological illusion, we could ignore our fears and truly interact.": 1,
    " you": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " And that's it.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1,
    "And thank you, Eddie.": 1,
    "Thank you, Marco.": 1
