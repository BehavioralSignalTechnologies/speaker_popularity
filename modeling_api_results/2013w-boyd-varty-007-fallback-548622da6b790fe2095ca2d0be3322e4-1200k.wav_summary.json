    "Thank you.": 3,
    " No.": 2,
    " I'm a man who's trying to live from his heart.": 1,
    " And so just before I get going, I wanted to tell you as a South African that one of the men who has inspired me most": 1,
    " passed away a few hours ago, Nelson Mandela has come to the end of his long walk to freedom.": 1,
    " And so this talk is going to be for him.": 1,
    " I grew up in Wanda.": 1,
    " I grew up amongst those animals.": 1,
    " I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa.": 1,
    " at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve.": 1,
    "It's a place where my family has been in the safari business for four generations.": 1,
    " Now, for as long as I can remember, my job has been to take people out into nature.": 1,
    "And so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity": 1,
    " to bring some of my experiences out in nature into this gathering.": 1,
    " You know, Africa is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories.": 1,
    " And so what I have to share with you today is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories.": 1,
    "Stories about heroes of heart.": 1,
    " Now, my stories are not the stories that you'll hear on the news.": 1,
    "And while it's true that Africa is a harsh place, I also know it to be a place that's people, animals, and ecosystems.": 1,
    " teach us about a more interconnected world.": 1,
    " When I was nine years old, President Mandela came to stay with my family.": 1,
    "He had just been released from his 27 years of incarceration and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status.": 1,
    " Members of the African National Congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye.": 1,
    "And it's true that lions": 1,
    " tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi.": 1,
    " But it was a defining time for me as a young boy.": 1,
    "I would take him breakfast in bed, and then in an old tracksuit and slippers, he would go for a walk around the garden.": 1,
    " At night I would sit with my family around the snowy bunny-eared TV and watch images of that same quiet man from the garden surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly.": 1,
    " He was bringing peace to a divided and violent South Africa.": 1,
    "One man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity.": 1,
    " Mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think, to create in himself the things he most wanted for South Africa.": 1,
    "Peace, reconciliation, harmony.": 1,
    " Through this act of immense open-heartedness, he was to become the embodiment of what in South Africa we call Ubuntu.": 1,
    " Ubuntu, I am because of you, or people are not people without other people.": 1,
    " It's not a new idea or value, but it's one that I certainly think at these times is worth building on.": 1,
    "In fact, it is said that in the collective consciousness of Africa, we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others.": 1,
    " Ubuntu is at play right now.": 1,
    "You are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who I am.": 1,
    " Without you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room, and I spent a lot of time last week doing that, and it's not the same as this.": 1,
    " If Mandela was the national and international embodiment, then the man who taught me the most about this value personally was this man, Solium Longo.": 1,
    "Soli was born under a tree 60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique.": 1,
    " He would never have a lot of money, but he was to be one of the richest men I would ever meet.": 1,
    "Solly grew up tending to his father's cattle.": 1,
    "Now I can tell you, I don't know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle, but it makes for uber resourcefulness.": 1,
    " The first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing these safari tracks.": 1,
    "Where he had learned to do that out in the bush, I have no idea, but he could do it.": 1,
    " He then moved across into what we called the Habitat Team.": 1,
    "These were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well-being.": 1,
    "He fixed roads, he mended wetlands, he did some anti-poaching, and then one day we were out together.": 1,
    " and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked.": 1,
    "And it was an old track, but for fun he turned and he began to follow.": 1,
    "And I tell you, I could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pug marks that this man was a PhD-level tracker.": 1,
    " If you drove past Sully somewhere out on the reserve, you look up in your rear-view mirror, you see he stopped the car 20, 50 meters down the road, just in case you need help with something.": 1,
    " The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said, Sully, you are pathologically helpful.": 1,
    " When I started professionally guiding people out into this environment, Sully was my tracker.": 1,
    "We worked together as a team.": 1,
    "And the first guests we ever got were a philanthropy group from your East Coast.": 1,
    " And they said to Solly on the side, they said, before we even go out to see lions and leopards, we want to see where you live.": 1,
    "So we took them up to his house.": 1,
    "And this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when Solly's wife,": 1,
    " who was learning English, was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying, hello, I love you.": 1,
    "Welcome, I love you.": 1,
    "And there was something so beautifully African about it to me, this small house with a huge heart in it.": 1,
    " On the day that Sully saved my life, he was already my hero.": 1,
    "It was a hot day and we found ourselves down by the river.": 1,
    "Because of the heat, I took my shoes off.": 1,
    " and I rolled up my pants and I walked into the water.": 1,
    "Sully remained on the bank.": 1,
    "The water was clear, running over sand.": 1,
    "And we turned and we began to make our way upstream.": 1,
    " And a few meters ahead of us, there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank and its branches were touching the water and it was shadowy.": 1,
    "And if it had been a horror movie,": 1,
    " People in the audience would have started saying, don't go in there.": 1,
    "Don't go in there.": 1,
    " And of course, the crocodile was in the shadows.": 1,
    "Now, the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite.": 1,
    "Wham!": 1,
    "It hits me by my right leg.": 1,
    "It pulls me.": 1,
    "It turns.": 1,
    "I throw my hand up.": 1,
    "I'm able to grab a branch.": 1,
    "It's shaking me violently.": 1,
    " It's a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you.": 1,
    "And there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that.": 1,
    " Sully on the bank sees that I'm in trouble.": 1,
    "He turns, he begins to make his way to me.": 1,
    "The croc again continues to shake me.": 1,
    "It goes to bite me a second time.": 1,
    "I notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream.": 1,
    "As it bites the second time, I kick.": 1,
    " My foot goes down its throat, it spits me out.": 1,
    "I pull myself up into the branches and as I come out of the water I look over my shoulder.": 1,
    " My leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description.": 1,
    "The bone is cracked, the meat is torn up.": 1,
    "I make an instant decision that I'll never look at that again.": 1,
    " As I come out the water, Solly arrives at a deep section, a channel between us.": 1,
    "He knows, he sees the state of my leg.": 1,
    "He knows that between him and I, there is a crocodile.": 1,
    " And I can tell you this man doesn't slow down for one second.": 1,
    "He comes straight into the channel.": 1,
    "He wades into above his waist.": 1,
    "He gets to me.": 1,
    "He grabs me.": 1,
    "I'm still in a vulnerable position.": 1,
    " He picks me up and puts me on his shoulder.": 1,
    "This is the other thing about Solly.": 1,
    "He's freakishly strong.": 1,
    "He turns.": 1,
    "He walks me up the bank.": 1,
    "He lays me down.": 1,
    "He pulls his shirt off.": 1,
    "He wraps it around my leg.": 1,
    "Picks me up a second time.": 1,
    "Walks me to a vehicle.": 1,
    " and he's able to get me to medical attention and I survive.": 1,
    " Now, I don't know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you, but for Solly, it was as natural as breathing.": 1,
    " And he is one amazing example of what I have experienced all over Africa.": 1,
    "In a more collective society, we realize": 1,
    " from the inside that our own wellbeing is deeply tied to the wellbeing of others.": 1,
    " Danger is shared, pain is shared, joy is shared, achievement is shared, houses are shared, food is shared.": 1,
    " Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts and to share.": 1,
    "And what Soli taught me that day is the essence of this value is animated empathetic action in every moment.": 1,
    " Now, though the root word is about people, I thought that maybe Ubuntu was only about people.": 1,
    "And then I met this young lady.": 1,
    " Her name was Elvis.": 1,
    "In fact, Solly gave her the name Elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the Elvis the pelvis dance.": 1,
    " She was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis.": 1,
    "She arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route.": 1,
    " When I first saw her, I thought she would be dead in a matter of days.": 1,
    "And yet for the next five years, she returned in the winter months.": 1,
    " And we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track.": 1,
    "It looked like an inverted bracket and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow.": 1,
    "And then we would come around the corner and there she would be with her herd.": 1,
    " and the outpouring of emotion from people on our safari trucks.": 1,
    "As they saw her, there was the sense of kinship.": 1,
    "And it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel": 1,
    " a natural connection with the natural world and with animals.": 1,
    "And yet still I remained amazed that she was surviving.": 1,
    " And then one day, we came across them at this small water hole.": 1,
    "It was sort of a hollow in the ground.": 1,
    "And I watched as the matriarch drank.": 1,
    "And then she turned in that beautiful slow motion of elephants.": 1,
    "It looks like the almond motion.": 1,
    "And she began to make her way up the steep bank.": 1,
    " The rest of the herd turned and began to follow.": 1,
    " And I watched young Elvis begin to psych herself up for the hill.": 1,
    "Visibly, her ears came forward.": 1,
    "She had a full go at it, and halfway up, her legs gave way, and she fell backwards.": 1,
    " She attempted it a second time, and again, halfway up, she fell backwards.": 1,
    "And on the third attempt, an amazing thing happened.": 1,
    " Halfway up the bank, a young teenage elephant came in behind her and he propped his trunk underneath her and he began to shovel her up the bank.": 1,
    " and it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant.": 1,
    "The next day, I watched again.": 1,
    " as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground.": 1,
    " And a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant.": 1,
    " What Elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of Ubuntu.": 1,
    " And I believe that in the Cathedral of the Wild, we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us.": 1,
    "And it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity.": 1,
    " but through all the creatures that live on this planet.": 1,
    "If Africa has a gift to share, it's a gift of a more collective society.": 1,
    " And while it's true that Ubuntu is an African idea, what I see is the essence of that value being invented here.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " So Boyd, we know that you knew President Mandela from early childhood and that you heard the news as we all did today.": 1,
    " deeply distraught and know the tragic loss that it is to the world.": 1,
    "But I just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts, because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session.": 1,
    " Thanks, Pat.": 1,
    "Well, I'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on he was suffering.": 1,
    "And so, of course, there's the mixed emotions.": 1,
    "But I just think of so many occurrences, like the time he went on the Oprah show": 1,
    " and asked her what the show would be about.": 1,
    " He's like, well, it'll be about you.": 1,
    " I mean that's just incredible humility.": 1,
    "He was the father of our nation.": 1,
    " And we've got a road to walk in South Africa.": 1,
    "And everything, they used to call it Madiba magic.": 1,
    "You know, he used to go to a rugby match and we would win.": 1,
    "Anywhere he went, things went well.": 1,
    " But I think that magic will be with us.": 1,
    " The important thing is that we carry what he stood for.": 1,
    "And so that's what I'm going to try and do, and that's what people all over South Africa are trying to do.": 1,
    "And that's what you've done today.": 1,
    "Thanks very much.": 1
