    " I'd like to talk about my dad.": 1,
    "My dad has Alzheimer's disease.": 1,
    "He started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago, and he was officially diagnosed in 2005.": 1,
    " Now he's really pretty sick.": 1,
    "He needs help eating.": 1,
    "He needs help getting dressed.": 1,
    "He doesn't really know where he is or when it is.": 1,
    " And it's been really, really hard.": 1,
    "My dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life, and I've spent the last decade watching him disappear.": 1,
    " My dad's not alone.": 1,
    "There's about 35 million people globally living with some kind of dementia.": 1,
    "And by 2030, they're expecting that to double to 70 million.": 1,
    "That's a lot of people.": 1,
    " Dementia scares us.": 1,
    "The confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia, the big numbers of people who get it, they frighten us.": 1,
    "And because of that fear, we tend to do one of two things.": 1,
    " We go into denial.": 1,
    "It's not me.": 1,
    "It has nothing to do with me.": 1,
    "It's never going to happen to me.": 1,
    " or we decide that we're gonna prevent dementia and it will never happen to us because we are gonna do everything right and it won't come and get us.": 1,
    " I'm looking for a third way.": 1,
    "I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.": 1,
    " Prevention is good, and I'm doing the things that you can do to prevent Alzheimer's.": 1,
    "I'm eating right.": 1,
    "I'm exercising every day.": 1,
    "I'm keeping my mind active.": 1,
    " That's what the research says you should do.": 1,
    "But the research also shows that there's nothing that will 100% protect you.": 1,
    "If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.": 1,
    " That's what happened with my dad.": 1,
    "My dad was a bilingual college professor.": 1,
    "His hobbies were chess, bridge, and writing op-eds.": 1,
    " He got dementia anyway.": 1,
    "If the monster wants you, the monster's going to get you, especially if you're me, because Alzheimer's tends to run in families.": 1,
    " So I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.": 1,
    " Based on what I've learned from taking care of my father and researching what it's like to live with dementia, I'm focusing on three things in my preparation.": 1,
    " I'm changing what I do for fun.": 1,
    " I'm working to build my physical strength.": 1,
    "And this is the hard one.": 1,
    "I'm trying to become a better person.": 1,
    " Let's start with the hobbies.": 1,
    " When you get dementia, it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself.": 1,
    "You can't sit and have long talks with your old friends because you don't know who they are.": 1,
    "It's confusing to watch television and often very frightening.": 1,
    "And reading is just about impossible.": 1,
    " When you care for someone with dementia and you get training, they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar, hands-on, open-ended.": 1,
    " With my dad, that turned out to be letting him fill out forms.": 1,
    " He was a college professor at a state school.": 1,
    "He knows what paperwork looks like.": 1,
    " He'll sign his name on every line, he'll check all the boxes, he'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers.": 1,
    "But it got me thinking, what would my caregivers do with me?": 1,
    " I'm my father's daughter.": 1,
    "I read, I write, I think about global health a lot.": 1,
    " Would they give me academic journals so I could scribble in the margins?": 1,
    "Would they give me charts and graphs that I could color?": 1,
    " So I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands-on.": 1,
    " I've always liked to draw, so I'm doing it more even though I'm really very bad at it.": 1,
    "I am learning some basic origami.": 1,
    "I can make a really great box.": 1,
    " And I'm teaching myself to knit, which so far I can knit a blob.": 1,
    " But you know, it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it.": 1,
    "What matters is that my hands know how to do it.": 1,
    "Because the more things that are familiar, the more things my hands know how to do, the more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain's not running the show anymore.": 1,
    " They say that people who are engaged in activities are happier, easier for their caregivers to look after.": 1,
    "It may even slow the progress of the disease.": 1,
    "That all seems like wind to me.": 1,
    "I want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can.": 1,
    " A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms as well as cognitive symptoms.": 1,
    "You lose your sense of balance, you get muscle tremors.": 1,
    " And that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile.": 1,
    "They get scared to walk around.": 1,
    "They get scared to move.": 1,
    "So I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance.": 1,
    "I'm doing yoga and Tai Chi to improve my balance so that when I start to lose it,": 1,
    " I'll still be able to be mobile.": 1,
    "I'm doing weight-bearing exercise so that I have the muscle strength so that when I start to wither, I have more time that I can still move around.": 1,
    " Finally, the third thing, I'm trying to become a better person.": 1,
    "My dad was kind and loving before he had Alzheimer's, and he's kind and loving now.": 1,
    " I've seen him lose his intellect, his sense of humor, his language skills.": 1,
    "But I've also seen this.": 1,
    "He loves me.": 1,
    "He loves my sons.": 1,
    "He loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers.": 1,
    " And that love makes us want to be around him even now, even when it's so hard.": 1,
    "When you take away everything that he ever learned in this world, his naked heart still shines.": 1,
    " I was never as kind as my dad, and I was never as loving.": 1,
    "And what I need now is to learn to be like that.": 1,
    "I need a heart so pure that if it's stripped bare by dementia, it will survive.": 1,
    " I don't want to get Alzheimer's disease.": 1,
    "What I want is a cure in the next 20 years soon enough to protect me.": 1,
    " But if it comes to me, I'm going to be ready.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
