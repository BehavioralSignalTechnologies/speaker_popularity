    " Okay.": 3,
    " Thank you.": 2,
    " Good morning everybody.": 1,
    "I'd like to talk about a couple of things today.": 1,
    "The first thing is water.": 1,
    "Now I see you've all been enjoying the water that's been provided for you here at the conference over the past couple of days and I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source.": 1,
    " But what if it wasn't?": 1,
    "What if it was from a source like this?": 1,
    " then statistics would actually say that half of you would now be suffering with diarrhoea.": 1,
    " I've talked a lot in the past about statistics and the provision of safe drinking water for all.": 1,
    "But they just don't seem to get through.": 1,
    "And I think I've worked out why.": 1,
    " It's because using current thinking, the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving.": 1,
    " So we just switch off us, governments and aid agencies.": 1,
    " Well today, I'd like to show you that through thinking differently, the problem has been solved.": 1,
    " By the way, since I've been speaking, another 13,000 people around the world are suffering now with diarrhea.": 1,
    "And four children have just died.": 1,
    " I invented Lifesaver Bottle because I got angry.": 1,
    " I, like most of you, was sitting down the day after Christmas in 2004 when I was watching the devastating news of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in, playing out on TV.": 1,
    " the days and weeks that followed, people fleeing to the hills, being forced to drink contaminated water or face death.": 1,
    " That really stuck with me.": 1,
    " Then, a few months later, Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America.": 1,
    "Okay, I thought, here's a first world country, let's see what they can do.": 1,
    "Day one, nothing.": 1,
    "Day two, nothing.": 1,
    " Nothing.": 1,
    " Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome?": 1,
    " People were shooting each other on the streets for TV sets and water.": 1,
    " That's when I decided I had to do something.": 1,
    " Now, I spent a lot of time in my garage over the next weeks and months, and also in my kitchen, much to the dismay of my wife.": 1,
    "However, after a few failed prototypes, I finally came up with this, the lifesaver bottle.": 1,
    " Okay, now for the science bit.": 1,
    "Before Lifesaver, the best hand filters were only capable of filtering down to about 200 nanometers.": 1,
    " The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometres.": 1,
    "So 200 nanometre bacteria is going to get through a 200 nanometre hole.": 1,
    "The smallest virus on the other hand is about 25 nanometres.": 1,
    " So that's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes.": 1,
    " Lifesaver paws are 15 nanometers.": 1,
    " So nothing's getting through.": 1,
    " Okay, I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration.": 1,
    "Would you like to see that?": 1,
    "I spent all the time setting this up, so I guess I should.": 1,
    "We're in the fine city of Oxford.": 1,
    "So, someone's done that up.": 1,
    "Fine city of Oxford.": 1,
    "So what I've done is I've gone and got some water from the River Cherwell.": 1,
    " and the River Thames that flow through here, and this is the water.": 1,
    "But I got to thinking, you know, if we were in the middle of a flood zone,": 1,
    " in Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this.": 1,
    "So I've got some stuff to add into it.": 1,
    "And this is from my pond.": 1,
    "Have a smell of that, Mr. Cameraman.": 1,
    "Right.": 1,
    "We're just going to pour that in there.": 1,
    " Okay, we've got some runoff from a sewage farm.": 1,
    "So I'm just going to put that in there.": 1,
    " Put that in there, there we go.": 1,
    " and some other bits and pieces.": 1,
    "Chuck that in there.": 1,
    "And I've got a little gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit.": 1,
    "So we're just gonna...": 1,
    " Put that in there as well.": 1,
    "Okay.": 1,
    "Now, the Lifesaver Bottle works really simply.": 1,
    " You just scoop the water up.": 1,
    "Today I'm going to use a jug just to show you all.": 1,
    "Let's get a bit of that poo in there.": 1,
    " That's not dirty enough, let's just stir that up a little bit.": 1,
    " Okay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water": 1,
    " and put it in here.": 1,
    "Do you want to drink yet?": 1,
    " Okay, there we go.": 1,
    " Replace the top.": 1,
    " Give it a few pumps, okay?": 1,
    "That's all that's necessary.": 1,
    " Now as soon as I pop the teat, sterile drinking water is going to come out and I've got to be quick.": 1,
    "Okay, ready?": 1,
    " There we go.": 1,
    "Mind the electrics.": 1,
    "That is safe, sterile drinking water.": 1,
    " There you go, Chris.": 1,
    " What's it taste of?": 1,
    " Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show, okay?": 1,
    "Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world.": 1,
    "It'll last for 6,000 litres and when it's expired using failsafe technology the system will shut off protecting the user.": 1,
    " pop the cartridge out, pop a new one in, it's good for another 6,000 litres.": 1,
    " So let's look at the applications.": 1,
    "Traditionally in a crisis, what do we do?": 1,
    "We ship water.": 1,
    "Then, after a few weeks, we set up camps.": 1,
    "And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water.": 1,
    " What happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp?": 1,
    " diseases spread, more resources are required.": 1,
    "The problem just becomes self-perpetuating.": 1,
    "But by thinking differently and shipping these, people can stay put.": 1,
    " They can make their own sterile drinking water and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives.": 1,
    " Now it doesn't require a natural disaster for this to work.": 1,
    " The old thinking of national infrastructure and pipe work is too expensive.": 1,
    "When you run the numbers on the calculator, you run out of noughts.": 1,
    "So here's the thinking different bit.": 1,
    " Instead of shipping water and using man-made processes to do it, let's use Mother Nature.": 1,
    "She's got a fantastic system.": 1,
    "She picks the water up from there, desalinates it for free,": 1,
    " transports over there and dumps it onto the mountains, rivers and streams.": 1,
    "And where do people live?": 1,
    "Near water.": 1,
    "All we've got to do is make it sterile.": 1,
    " How do we do that?": 1,
    "Well, we could use a Lifesaver bottle or we could use one of these.": 1,
    "The same technology in a jerry can.": 1,
    "This will process 25,000 litres of water.": 1,
    " That's good enough for a family of four for three years.": 1,
    " And how much does it cost?": 1,
    "About half a cent a day to run.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " So by thinking differently and processing water at the point of use, mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day to collect their water.": 1,
    " They can get it from a source nearby.": 1,
    " So with just $8 billion, we can hit the Millennium Goals target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water.": 1,
    "To put that into context,": 1,
    " The UK government spends about \u00a312 billion a year on foreign aid.": 1,
    " But why stop there?": 1,
    " With 20 billion dollars, everyone can have access to safe drinking water.": 1,
    " So the 3.5 billion people that suffer every year as a result, and the 2 million kids that die every year,": 1,
    " We'll live!": 1
