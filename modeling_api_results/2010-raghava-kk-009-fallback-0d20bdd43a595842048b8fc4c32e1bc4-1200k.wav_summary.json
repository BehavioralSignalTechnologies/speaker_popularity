    " I think it was in my second grade that I was caught drawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo.": 1,
    "I was sent straight away to my school principal.": 1,
    " And my school principal, a sweet nun, looked at my book with disgust, flipped through the pages, saw all the nudes.": 1,
    "You know, I'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and I copy her.": 1,
    " And the nun slapped me on my face and said, sweet Jesus, this kid has already begun.": 1,
    "I had no clue what she was talking about, but it was good enough.": 1,
    "But it was convincing enough for me never to draw again.": 1,
    " until the ninth grade.": 1,
    "Thanks to a really boring lecture, I started caricaturing my teachers in school.": 1,
    "And, you know, I got a lot of popularity.": 1,
    " I don't play sports.": 1,
    "I'm really bad at sports.": 1,
    "I don't have the fanciest gadgets at home.": 1,
    "I'm not on top of the class.": 1,
    "So for me, cartooning gave me a sense of identity.": 1,
    "I got popular.": 1,
    " But I was scared I'd get caught again.": 1,
    "So what I did was I quickly put together a collage of all the teachers I'd drawn, glorified my school principal, put him right on top, and gifted it to him.": 1,
    " He had a good laugh at the other teachers and put it up on the notice board.": 1,
    " This is a part of that.": 1,
    "And I became a school hero.": 1,
    "All my seniors knew me.": 1,
    "I felt really special.": 1,
    " I have to tell you a little bit about my family.": 1,
    "That's my mother.": 1,
    "I love her to bits.": 1,
    "She's the one who taught me how to draw and, more importantly, how to love.": 1,
    "She's a bit of a hippie.": 1,
    "She said, don't say that, but I'm saying it anyway.": 1,
    " The rest of my family are boring academics, busy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic ambassador car.": 1,
    "My father's a little different.": 1,
    " My father believed in a holistic approach to living.": 1,
    "And you know, every time he taught us, he'd say, I hate these books, because these books are hijacked by industrial revolution.": 1,
    "While he still held that world view.": 1,
    " I was 16.": 1,
    "I got the best lawyer in town, my older brother Karthik, and I sat him down and I said, Pa, from today onwards I've decided I'm going to be disciplined.": 1,
    "I'm going to be curious.": 1,
    " I'm going to learn something new every day.": 1,
    "I'm going to be very hardworking, and I'm not going to depend on you emotionally or financially.": 1,
    " And he was very impressed.": 1,
    "He was all tearing up, ready to hug me.": 1,
    "And I said, hold that thought.": 1,
    "I said, can I quit school then?": 1,
    " But to cut a long story short, I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist.": 1,
    "I must have done about 30,000 caricatures.": 1,
    "I would do birthday parties, weddings, divorces, anything.": 1,
    "Anyone who wanted to use my services.": 1,
    " But most importantly, while I was traveling, I taught children cartooning.": 1,
    "And in exchange, I learned how to be spontaneous and mad and crazy and fun.": 1,
    "When I started teaching them, I said, let me start doing this professionally.": 1,
    " When I was 18, I started my own school.": 1,
    "However, an 18 year old trying to start a school is not easy unless you have a big patron or a big supporter.": 1,
    " So I was flipping through the pages of the Times of India when I saw that the Prime Minister of India was visiting my hometown, Bangalore.": 1,
    " And you know, just like how every cartoonist knows Bush here, and if you had to meet Bush, it would be the funnest thing because his face was a cartoonist's delight.": 1,
    " I had to meet my Prime Minister.": 1,
    "I went to the place where his helicopter was about to land.": 1,
    "I saw layers of security.": 1,
    "I caricatured my way through three layers by just impressing the guards.": 1,
    " But I got stuck.": 1,
    "I got stuck at the third.": 1,
    "And what happened was, to my luck, I saw a nuclear scientist in whose party had done cartoons.": 1,
    "I ran up to him and said, hello, sir, how do you do?": 1,
    "He said, what are you doing here, Raghava?": 1,
    "I said, I'm here to meet the prime minister.": 1,
    " He said, oh, so am I. I hopped into his car and off we went through the layman in the air security.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " I sat him down, I caricatured him, and since then I've caricatured hundreds of celebrities.": 1,
    "This is one I remember fondly.": 1,
    "Salman Rushdie was pissed off, I think, because I altered the map of New York, if you notice.": 1,
    " Anyway, the next slide I'm about to show you.": 1,
    " Should I just turn that off?": 1,
    "Anyway the next slide I'm about to show you is a little more serious.": 1,
    "I was hesitant to include this in my presentation because this cartoon was published": 1,
    " Soon after 9-11, what was for me a very naive observation turned out to be a disaster.": 1,
    "That evening I came home to hundreds of hate mails.": 1,
    " hundreds of people telling me how they could have lived another day without seeing this.": 1,
    "I was also asked to leave the organization, a cartoonist organization in America, that for me was my lifeline.": 1,
    " That's when I realized, you know, cartoons are really powerful.": 1,
    "Art comes with responsibility.": 1,
    "Anyway, what I did was I decided that I need to take a break.": 1,
    "I quit my job with the papers, I closed my school, and I wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks.": 1,
    " And I decided to go traveling.": 1,
    "When I went traveling, I remember I met this fabulous old man who I met when I was caricaturing, who turned out to be an artist in Italy.": 1,
    "He invited me to his studio.": 1,
    "He said, come and visit.": 1,
    " When I went, I saw the ghastliest thing ever.": 1,
    "I saw this dead, naked effigy of himself hanging from the ceiling.": 1,
    " I said, oh my God, what is that?": 1,
    "And I asked him and he said, oh that thing, in the night I die and the morning I am born again.": 1,
    " I thought he was cuckoo.": 1,
    "But something about that really stuck.": 1,
    "I loved it.": 1,
    "I thought there was something really beautiful about that.": 1,
    "So I said, I am dead, so I need to be born again.": 1,
    "So I wanted to be a painter like him, except I don't know how to paint.": 1,
    " So I tried going to the art store.": 1,
    "You know there are a hundred types of brushes?": 1,
    "Forget it.": 1,
    "They will confuse you even if you know how to draw.": 1,
    "So I decided I'm going to learn to paint by myself.": 1,
    "I'm going to show you a very quick clip to show you how I painted.": 1,
    " and a little bit about my city, Bangalore.": 1,
    " They had to be larger than life.": 1,
    "Everything had to be larger.": 1,
    "The next painting was even bigger, and even bigger.": 1,
    "And for me, I had to dance while I painted.": 1,
    "It was so exciting.": 1,
    "Except...": 1,
    " I even started painting dancers.": 1,
    "Here, for example, is a flamenco dancer.": 1,
    "Except there was one problem.": 1,
    "I didn't know the dance form, so I started following them.": 1,
    "You know, I made some money, sold my paintings, and I'd rush off to France or Spain.": 1,
    " and work with them.": 1,
    "That's Pepe Linares, the renowned flamenco singer.": 1,
    "But I had one problem.": 1,
    "My paintings never danced.": 1,
    " As much energy as I put into them while making them, they never danced.": 1,
    "So I decided I had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning.": 1,
    "I called my friends, painted on their bodies, and had them dance in front of a painting.": 1,
    "And all of a sudden, my paintings came alive.": 1,
    " And then I was fortunate enough to actually perform this in California with Velocity Circus.": 1,
    "And I sat like you guys there in the audience and I saw my work come alive.": 1,
    " You know, normally you work in isolation and you show at a gallery.": 1,
    "But here, the work was coming alive and it had some other artists working with me.": 1,
    "The collaborative effort was fabulous.": 1,
    " I said I'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody I meet.": 1,
    "I started doing fashion.": 1,
    "This is a fashion show we held in London.": 1,
    " The best collaboration, of course, is with children.": 1,
    "They are ruthless, they are honest, but they're full of energy and fun.": 1,
    " This is a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation.": 1,
    "And I must say, I spent time in the Bronx working with these kids.": 1,
    "And in exchange for me working with them, they taught me how to be cool.": 1,
    " I don't think I've succeeded, but they've taught me.": 1,
    "They said, stop saying sorry.": 1,
    "Say, my bad.": 1,
    " Then I said, all this is good, but I want to paint like a real painter.": 1,
    "American education is so expensive.": 1,
    " I was in India and I was walking down the streets and I saw a billboard painted and these guys paint humongous paintings and they look really good.": 1,
    " And I wondered how they did it from so close.": 1,
    "So one day I had the opportunity to meet one of these guys.": 1,
    "And I said, how do you paint like that?": 1,
    "Who taught you?": 1,
    " And he said, oh, it's very easy, I can teach you.": 1,
    "But we're leaving the city because billboard painters are a dying, extinct bunch of artists because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them.": 1,
    " I said, in exchange for education on how to paint, I will support them, and I started a company.": 1,
    "And since then, I've been painting all over the place.": 1,
    "This is a painting I did of my wife in my apartment.": 1,
    " This is another painting, and in fact, I started painting on anything and started sending them around town.": 1,
    "Since I mentioned my wife, the most important collaboration has been with her, Netra.": 1,
    "Netra and I met when she was 18.": 1,
    " I must have been 19 and a half then, and it was love at first sight.": 1,
    "I lived in India, she lived in America.": 1,
    "She'd come every two months to visit me.": 1,
    " And then I said, I'm the man.": 1,
    "I'm the man.": 1,
    "And I have to reciprocate.": 1,
    "I have to travel seven oceans.": 1,
    "And I have to come and see you.": 1,
    "I did that twice and I went broke.": 1,
    " So then I said, Nate, what do I do?": 1,
    "She said, why don't you send me your paintings?": 1,
    "My dad knows a bunch of rich guys.": 1,
    "We'll try and calm them into buying it.": 1,
    "But it turned out...": 1,
    " after I sent the works to her that her dad's friends, like most of you, are deeks.": 1,
    "I'm joking.": 1,
    " No, they were really big geeks and they didn't know much about art.": 1,
    "So Netha was stuck with 30 paintings of mine.": 1,
    " So, what we did was we rented a little van and we drove all over the East Coast trying to sell it.": 1,
    "She contacted anyone and everyone who was willing to buy my work.": 1,
    " She made enough money, she sold out the whole collection and made enough money to move me for four years with lawyers, a company, everything.": 1,
    "And she became my manager.": 1,
    "That's us in New York.": 1,
    "Notice one thing.": 1,
    " We're equal here.": 1,
    "Something happened along the line.": 1,
    " But this brought me, with Netra managing my career, it brought me a lot of success.": 1,
    "I was really happy.": 1,
    "I thought of myself as a bit of a rock star.": 1,
    "I loved the attention.": 1,
    "This is all the press we got.": 1,
    "And we said, it's time to celebrate.": 1,
    " And I said, the best way to celebrate is to marry Netra.": 1,
    "I said, let's get married.": 1,
    "And I said, not just married, let's invite everyone who's helped us, all the people who bought our work.": 1,
    " And you won't believe it, we put together a list of 7,000 people who made a ridiculous list, but I was determined to bring them to India.": 1,
    "So a lot of them were in India.": 1,
    " 150 artists volunteered to help me with my wedding.": 1,
    "We had fashion designers, installation artists,": 1,
    " models, we had makeup artists, jewelry designers, all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation.": 1,
    "And I had a special": 1,
    " installation in tribute to my in-laws.": 1,
    "I had the vegetable carvers work on that for me.": 1,
    "But all this excitement led to the press writing about us.": 1,
    "We were in the papers.": 1,
    " still in the news three years later, but unfortunately something tragic happened right after.": 1,
    " My mother fell very ill.": 1,
    "And I love my mother.": 1,
    "And I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die.": 1,
    "And they said, you have to say bye to her.": 1,
    "You have to do what you have to do.": 1,
    " And I was devastated.": 1,
    "I had shows booked up for another year.": 1,
    "I was on a high.": 1,
    "And I couldn't.": 1,
    "My life was not exuberant.": 1,
    "I could not live this larger-than-life person.": 1,
    "I started exploring the darker.": 1,
    " abscesses of the human mind.": 1,
    "Of course, my work turned": 1,
    " ugly.": 1,
    "But another thing happened.": 1,
    "I lost all my audiences.": 1,
    "The Bollywood stars who I would party with and buy my work disappeared.": 1,
    "The collectors, the friends, the press": 1,
    " Everyone said, nice, but thank you.": 1,
    "No thank you is more like it.": 1,
    "But I wanted people to actually feel my work from their gut because I was painting it from my gut.": 1,
    " If they wanted beauty, I said, this is the beauty I'm willing to give you.": 1,
    "It's politicized.": 1,
    "Of course, none of them liked it.": 1,
    "My works also turned autobiographical.": 1,
    " At this point, something else happened, a very, very dear friend of mine.": 1,
    " came out of the closet and in India at that time it was illegal to be gay and it's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person.": 1,
    "I was very upset.": 1,
    "I remember the time when my mother used to dress me up": 1,
    " As a little girl, that's me there.": 1,
    " because she wanted a girl and she has only boys.": 1,
    " And...": 1,
    " Anyway, I don't know what my friends are going to say after this talk.": 1,
    "Anyway, it's a secret.": 1,
    "So after this...": 1,
    " My works turned a little violent.": 1,
    "I talked about this masculinity that one need not perform.": 1,
    "And I talked about the weakness of male sexuality.": 1,
    " This time, not only did my collectors disappear, the political activists decided to ban me and to threaten me and to forbid me from showing.": 1,
    " It turned nasty, and I'm a bit of a chicken.": 1,
    "I can't deal with any threat.": 1,
    "This was a big threat.": 1,
    "So I decided it was time to end and go back home.": 1,
    "This time I said, let's try something different.": 1,
    "I need to be reborn again.": 1,
    " And I thought the best way, as most of you know who have children, the best way to have a new lease of life is to have a child.": 1,
    "I decided to have a child.": 1,
    " And before I did that, I quickly studied what can go wrong.": 1,
    "How can a family get dysfunctional?": 1,
    "And Rudra was born.": 1,
    "That's my little son.": 1,
    " And two magical things happened after he was born.": 1,
    "My mother miraculously recovered after a serious operation.": 1,
    " And this man was elected president of this country.": 1,
    "You know, I sat at home and I watched, I teared up and I said, that's where I want to be.": 1,
    "So Nathan and I": 1,
    " wound up our life, closed up everything we had, and we decided to move to New York.": 1,
    "And this was just eight months ago.": 1,
    " I moved back to New York, my work has changed.": 1,
    "Everything about my work has become more whimsical.": 1,
    "This one is called, what the fuck was I thinking?": 1,
    "It talks about mental incest, you know?": 1,
    " I may appear to be a very nice, clean, sweet boy, but I'm not.": 1,
    "I'm capable of thinking anything.": 1,
    "But I'm very civil in my action, I assure you.": 1,
    " These are just different cartoons.": 1,
    "And before I go, I want to tell you a little story.": 1,
    "I was talking to my mother and father this morning, and my dad said, I know you have so much you want to say, but you have to talk about your work with children.": 1,
    "So I said, okay.": 1,
    " I work with children all over the world, and that's an entirely different talk, but I want to leave you with one story that really, really inspired me.": 1,
    "I met Belinda when she was 16.": 1,
    "I was 17.": 1,
    " I was in Australia, and Belinda had cancer, and I was told she's not going to live very long.": 1,
    "They, in fact, told me three weeks.": 1,
    " I walk into a room and there was a shy girl and she was bald and she was trying to hide her baldness.": 1,
    "I whipped up my pen and I started drawing on her head and I drew a crown for her.": 1,
    " And then we started talking, and we spent a lovely time.": 1,
    "I told her how I ended up in Australia, how I backpacked, and who I conned, and how I got a ticket, and all the stories, and I drew it out for her.": 1,
    "And then I left.": 1,
    " Belinda died.": 1,
    " And within a few days of her death, they published a book for her.": 1,
    "And she used my cartoon on the cover.": 1,
    "And she wrote a little note.": 1,
    "She said, hey, rags.": 1,
    " Thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world.": 1,
    "For me, my art is my magic carpet ride.": 1,
    "I hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride and touch children and be honest.": 1,
    "Thank you so much.": 1
