    " So imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 feet.": 1,
    " Imagine a plane full of smoke.": 1,
    "Imagine an engine going clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack.": 1,
    "Sounds scary.": 1,
    "Well, I had a unique seat that day.": 1,
    "I was sitting in one D.": 1,
    " I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants.": 1,
    "So I looked at them right away and they said, no problem, we probably hit some birds.": 1,
    "The pilot had already turned the plane around and we weren't that far.": 1,
    "You could see Manhattan.": 1,
    " Two minutes later, three things happen at the same time.": 1,
    " The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River.": 1,
    " It's usually not the route.": 1,
    " He turns off the engines.": 1,
    " Now imagine being on a plane with no sound.": 1,
    " And then he says three words, as unemotional three words have I've ever heard.": 1,
    "He says, brace for impact.": 1,
    " I didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore.": 1,
    " I could see in her eyes it was terror, life was over.": 1,
    "Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.": 1,
    "I learned that it all changes in an instant.": 1,
    " We have this bucket list.": 1,
    "We have these things we want to do in life.": 1,
    "And I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out that I didn't.": 1,
    "All the fences I wanted to mend.": 1,
    "All the experiences I wanted to have and I never did.": 1,
    " As I thought about that later on, I came up with a saying, which is, I collect bad wines.": 1,
    "Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm opening it.": 1,
    "I no longer want to postpone anything in life.": 1,
    " And that urgency, that purpose has really changed my life.": 1,
    " The second thing I learned that day, and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge, which was by not a lot.": 1,
    " I thought about, wow, I really feel one real regret.": 1,
    "I've lived a good life.": 1,
    "In my own humanity of mistakes, I've tried to get better at everything I've tried.": 1,
    "But in my humanity, I also allow my ego to get in.": 1,
    " And I regretted the time I wasted in things that did not matter with people that matter.": 1,
    " And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.": 1,
    "And after, as I reflected on that, I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life.": 1,
    "It's not perfect.": 1,
    "It's a lot better.": 1,
    " I've not had a fight with my wife in two years.": 1,
    "It feels great.": 1,
    "I no longer try to be right.": 1,
    "I choose to be happy.": 1,
    " The third thing I learned, and this is as your mental clock starts going 15, 14, 13, you can see the water coming, I'm saying please blow up.": 1,
    "I don't want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you've seen in those documentaries.": 1,
    " And as we're coming down, I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary.": 1,
    "It's almost like we've been preparing for our whole lives.": 1,
    "But it was very sad.": 1,
    "I didn't want to go.": 1,
    "I love my life.": 1,
    " And that sadness really framed in one thought, which is, I only wish for one thing.": 1,
    "I only wish I could see my kids grow up.": 1,
    " About a month later, I was in a performance by my daughter, first grader, not much artistic talent.": 1,
    " Yeah.": 1,
    " And I'm bawling.": 1,
    "I'm crying like a little kid.": 1,
    " And it made all the sense in the world to me.": 1,
    "I realized at that point by connecting those two dots that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad.": 1,
    " Above all, above all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad.": 1,
    " I was given the gift of a miracle of not dying that day.": 1,
    "I was given another gift, which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently.": 1,
    " I challenge you guys that are flying today.": 1,
    "Imagine the same thing happens on your plane and please don't.": 1,
    "But imagine, and how would you change?": 1,
    "What would you get done that you're waiting to get done because you think you'll be here forever?": 1,
    " How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them?": 1,
    "And more than anything, are you being the best parent you can?": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
