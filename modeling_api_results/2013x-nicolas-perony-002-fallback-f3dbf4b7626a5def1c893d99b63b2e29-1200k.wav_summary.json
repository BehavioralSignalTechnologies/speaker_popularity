    " Science has allowed us to know so much about the far reaches of the universe.": 1,
    " which is at the same time tremendously important and extremely remote, and yet much closer, much more directly related to us, there are many things we don't fully understand.": 1,
    " And one of them is the extraordinary social complexity of the animals around us.": 1,
    "And today I want to tell you a few stories of animal complexity.": 1,
    "But first, what we call complexity.": 1,
    " What is complex?": 1,
    "Well, complex is not complicated.": 1,
    " Something complicated comprises many small parts, all different, and each of them has its own precise role in the machinery.": 1,
    "On the opposite.": 1,
    " A complex system is made of many, many similar parts, and it is their interaction that produces a globally coherent behavior.": 1,
    " Complex systems have many interacting parts which behave according to simple individual rules and this results in emergent properties.": 1,
    " The behavior of the system as a whole cannot be predicted from the individual rules only.": 1,
    "As Aristotle wrote, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.": 1,
    " From Aristotle, let's move on to a more concrete example of complex system.": 1,
    "These are Scottish terriers.": 1,
    "In the beginning, the system is disorganized.": 1,
    " Then comes the perturbation.": 1,
    "Milk.": 1,
    "Every individual starts pushing in one direction.": 1,
    "And this is what happens.": 1,
    " The pinwheel is an emergent property of the interactions between puppies whose only rule is to try and keep access to the milk and therefore to push in a random direction.": 1,
    " So, it's all about finding the simple rules from which complexity emerges.": 1,
    "I call this simplifying complexity.": 1,
    "And it's what we do at the Shell Systems Design at ETH Zurich.": 1,
    " We collect data on animal populations, analyze complex patterns, try to explain them.": 1,
    " It requires physicists to work with biologists, with mathematicians and computer scientists, and it is their interaction that produces cross-boundary competence to solve these problems.": 1,
    " So again, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.": 1,
    "In a way, collaboration is another example of complex system.": 1,
    " And you may be asking yourself, which side I'm on, biology or physics?": 1,
    "In fact, it's a little different.": 1,
    "And to explain, I need to tell you a short story about myself.": 1,
    " When I was a child, I loved to build stuff, to create complicated machines.": 1,
    "So I set out to study electrical engineering and robotics.": 1,
    " And my end of studies project was about building a robot called ER1 that looked like this that would collect information from its environment and proceed to follow a white line on the ground.": 1,
    " It was very, very complicated, but it worked beautifully in our test room.": 1,
    "And on demo day, professors had assembled to grade the project, so we took ER1 to the evaluation room.": 1,
    " It turned out the light in that room was slightly different.": 1,
    "The robot's vision system got confused.": 1,
    "At the first bend in the line, it left its course and crashed into a wall.": 1,
    " We had spent weeks building it, and all it took to destroy it was a subtle change in the color of the lights in the room.": 1,
    " That's when I realized that the more complicated you make a machine, the more likely that it will fail due to something absolutely unexpected.": 1,
    "And I decided that, in fact, I didn't really want to create complicated stuff.": 1,
    " I wanted to understand complexity, the complexity of the world around us, and especially in the animal kingdom, which brings us to bats.": 1,
    " Bershens bats are a common species of European bats.": 1,
    "They are very social animals.": 1,
    "Mostly they roost or sleep together.": 1,
    " And they live in maternity colonies, which means that every spring the females meet after the winter hibernation, and they stay together for about six months to rear their young.": 1,
    " And they all carry a very small chip, which means that every time one of them enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes, we know where she is.": 1,
    "And more importantly, we know with whom she is.": 1,
    " So I study rusting associations in bats.": 1,
    "And this is what it looks like.": 1,
    " During the day, the bats roost in a number of subgroups in different boxes.": 1,
    "It could be that on one day, the colony is split between two boxes.": 1,
    " But on another day, it could be together in a single box, or split between three or more boxes.": 1,
    "And that all seems rather erratic, really.": 1,
    "It's called fission-fusion dynamics.": 1,
    " the property for an animal group of regularly splitting and merging into different subgroups.": 1,
    "So what we do is take all these data from all these different days and pool them together to extract a long-term association pattern": 1,
    " by applying techniques of network analysis to get a complete picture of the social structure of the colony.": 1,
    "Okay?": 1,
    "So that's what this picture looks like.": 1,
    " In this network, all the circles are nodes, individual bats, and the lines between them are social bonds, associations between individuals.": 1,
    " Turns out this is a very interesting picture.": 1,
    "This bat colony is organized in two different communities which cannot be predicted from the daily fish and fusion dynamics.": 1,
    "We call them cryptic social units.": 1,
    " Even more interesting in fact, every year around October, the colonies split up and all bats hibernate separately.": 1,
    " But year after year, when the bats come together again in the spring, the communities stay the same.": 1,
    "So these bats remember their friends for a really long time.": 1,
    " With a brain the size of a peanut, they maintain individualized long-term social bonds.": 1,
    "We didn't know that was possible.": 1,
    " We knew that primates and elephants and dolphins could do that, but compared to bats, they have huge brains.": 1,
    " How could it be that the bats maintain this complex stable social structure with such limited cognitive abilities?": 1,
    " And this is where complexity brings an answer.": 1,
    "To understand this system, we built a computer model of roosting based on simple individual rules and simulated thousands and thousands of days in a virtual bat colony.": 1,
    " It's a mathematical model, but it's not complicated.": 1,
    "What the model told us is that in a nutshell, each bat knows a few other colony members as her friends, and is just slightly more likely to roost in a box with them.": 1,
    " Simple individual rules.": 1,
    "This is all it takes to explain the social complexity of these parts.": 1,
    "But it gets better.": 1,
    "Between 2010 and 2011,": 1,
    " the colony lost more than two thirds of its members, probably due to the very cold winter.": 1,
    " The next spring, it didn't form two communities like every year, which may have led the whole colony to die because it had become too small.": 1,
    "Instead, it formed a single cohesive social unit.": 1,
    " which allowed the colony to survive that season and thrive again in the next two years.": 1,
    " What we know is that the bats are not aware that their colony is doing this.": 1,
    "All they do is follow simple association rules and from this simplicity emerges social complexity which allows the colony to be resilient": 1,
    " against dramatic changes in the population structure.": 1,
    "And I find this incredible.": 1,
    " Now I want to tell you another story, but for this we have to travel from Europe to the Kalahari Desert in South Africa.": 1,
    "This is where meerkats live.": 1,
    " I'm sure you know meerkats.": 1,
    "They're fascinating creatures.": 1,
    "They live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy.": 1,
    "There is one dominant pair and many subordinates, some acting as sentinels, some acting as babysitters, some teaching pups and so on.": 1,
    " What we do is put very small GPS collars on these animals to study how they move together and what this has to do with their social structure.": 1,
    "And there's a very interesting example of collective movement in Mirkas.": 1,
    " In the middle of the reserve, which they live in, lies a road.": 1,
    "On this road there are cars, so it's dangerous.": 1,
    " But the meerkats have to cross it to get from one feeding place to another.": 1,
    "So we asked, how exactly do they do this?": 1,
    " We found that the dominant female is mostly the one who leads the group to the road.": 1,
    "But when it comes to crossing it, crossing the road, she gives way to the subordinates.": 1,
    "A matter of saying, you know, go ahead, tell me if it's safe.": 1,
    " What I didn't know, in fact, was what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow for this change at the edge of the group to happen, and if simple rules were sufficient to explain it.": 1,
    " So I built a model.": 1,
    "A model of simulated meerkats crossing a simulated road.": 1,
    "It's a simplistic model.": 1,
    "Moving meerkats are like random particles whose unique rule is one of alignment.": 1,
    "They simply move together.": 1,
    " When these particles get to the road, they sense some kind of obstacle and they bounce against it.": 1,
    "The only difference between the dominant female here in red and the other individuals": 1,
    " is that for her, the height of the obstacle, which is in fact the risk perceived from the road, is just slightly higher.": 1,
    "And this tiny difference in the individual rule of movement is sufficient to explain what we observe that": 1,
    " The dominant female leads her group to the road and then gives way to the others for them to cross first.": 1,
    " George Box, who was an English statistician, once wrote, all models are false, but some models are useful.": 1,
    " And in fact, this model is obviously false, because in reality, Mirka has anything but random particles.": 1,
    "But it's also useful, because it tells us that extreme simplicity in movement rules at the individual level": 1,
    " can result in a great deal of complexity at the level of the group.": 1,
    "So again, that's simplifying complexity.": 1,
    "I would like to conclude on what this means for the whole species.": 1,
    " When the dominant female gives way to a subordinate, it's not out of courtesy.": 1,
    " In fact, the dominant female is extremely important for the cohesion of the group.": 1,
    "If she dies on the road, the whole group is at risk.": 1,
    "So this behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response.": 1,
    " are replicating an evolved tactic that is thousands of generations old, and they're adapting it to a modern risk, in this case, a road built by humans.": 1,
    " They adapt very simple rules and the resulting complex behavior allows them to resist human encroachment into their natural habitat.": 1,
    " In the end, it may be bats who change their social structure in response to a population crash, or it may be meerkats who show novel adaptation to a human road, or it may be another species.": 1,
    " My message here, and it's not a complicated one, but a simple one of wonder and hope.": 1,
    " Animals show extraordinary social complexity and this allows them to adapt and respond to changes in their environment.": 1,
    " In three words, in the animal kingdom, simplicity leads to complexity, which leads to resilience.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " Thank you very much, Nikola, for this great start.": 1,
    "Little bit nervous?": 1,
    "Okay, thanks.": 1,
    " I'm sure a lot of people in the audience somehow tried to make associations between the animals you were talking about, the bats, murkats and humans.": 1,
    "You brought some examples.": 1,
    "The females are the social ones.": 1,
    "The females are the dominant ones.": 1,
    "I'm not sure who thinks how, but...": 1,
    " Is it okay to do these associations?": 1,
    "Are there stereotypes you can confirm in this regard that can be valid across all species?": 1,
    " Well, I would say there's also counter examples to these stereotypes.": 1,
    "For example, in the seahorses or in koalas, in fact, it is the males who take care of the young, always.": 1,
    " And the lesson is that it's often difficult and sometimes even a bit dangerous to draw parallels between humans and animals.": 1,
    "So that's it.": 1,
    " Okay, thank you very much for this great start.": 1,
    "Thank you, Nicola Ferroni.": 1
