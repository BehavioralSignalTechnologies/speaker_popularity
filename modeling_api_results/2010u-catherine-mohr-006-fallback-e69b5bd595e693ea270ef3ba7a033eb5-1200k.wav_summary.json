    " First of all, I'm a geek.": 1,
    "I'm an organic food eating, carbon footprint minimizing, robotic surgery geek.": 1,
    "And I really want to build green.": 1,
    " But I'm very suspicious of all of these well-meaning articles, people long on moral authority and short on data telling me how to do these kinds of things.": 1,
    "And so I have to figure this out for myself.": 1,
    "For example, is this evil?": 1,
    " I have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy self-actualized local cows on my countertop, and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up.": 1,
    "But can I use a paper towel?": 1,
    " The answer to this can be found in embodied energy.": 1,
    "This is the amount of energy that goes into any paper towel or embodied water.": 1,
    "And every time I use a paper towel, I am using this much virtual energy and water.": 1,
    "Wipe it up, throw it away.": 1,
    " Now, if I compare that to a cotton towel that I can use a thousand times, I don't have a whole lot of embodied energy.": 1,
    " until I wash that yogurty towel.": 1,
    "This is now operating energy.": 1,
    "So if I throw my towel in the washing machine, I've now put energy and water back into that towel.": 1,
    " unless I use a front-loading high-efficiency washing machine, and then it looks a little bit better.": 1,
    "But what about a recycled paper towel that comes in those little half sheets?": 1,
    "Well, now paper towel looks better.": 1,
    " Screw the paper towels.": 1,
    "Let's go to a sponge.": 1,
    "I wipe it with a sponge and I put it under the running water and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water.": 1,
    "Unless you're like me and you leave the handle in the position of a hot even when you turn it on.": 1,
    " And then you start to use more energy.": 1,
    "Or worse, you let it run until it's warm to rinse out your towel.": 1,
    "And now all bets are off.": 1,
    " What this says is that sometimes the things that you least expect, the position in which you put the handle, have a bigger effect than any of those other things that you are trying to optimize.": 1,
    " Now imagine someone as twisted as me trying to build a house.": 1,
    " That's what my husband and I are doing right now.": 1,
    "And so we wanted to know how green could we be.": 1,
    "And there's a thousand and one articles out there telling us how to make all these green trade-offs.": 1,
    " and they are just as suspect in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges and missing the elephant in the living room.": 1,
    "Now the average house": 1,
    " has about 300 megawatt hours of embodied energy in it.": 1,
    "This is the energy it takes to make it.": 1,
    "Millions and millions of paper towels.": 1,
    "We wanted to know how much better we could do.": 1,
    " And so like many people, we start with a house on a lot.": 1,
    "And I'm going to show you typical instruction on the top and what we're doing on the bottom.": 1,
    "So first we demolish it.": 1,
    " take some energy, but if you deconstruct it, you take it all apart, you use the bits, you can get some of that energy back.": 1,
    " We then dug a big hole to put in a rainwater catchment tank to take our yard water independent.": 1,
    "And then we poured a big foundation for passive solar.": 1,
    " Now you can reduce the embodied energy by about 25% by using high fly ash concrete.": 1,
    "We then put in framing.": 1,
    " And so this is framing lumber, composite materials, and it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that, but it can be a sustainable resource if you use FSC certified lumber.": 1,
    " We then go on to the first thing that was very surprising.": 1,
    "If we put aluminum windows in this house, we would double the energy use right there.": 1,
    "Now, PVC is a little bit better, but still not as good as the wood that we chose.": 1,
    " We then put in plumbing, electrical, and HVAC, and insulate.": 1,
    "Now, spray foam is an excellent insulator.": 1,
    "It fills in all of the cracks, but it is pretty high embodied energy.": 1,
    " and sprayed in cellulose or blue jeans is a much lower energy alternative to that.": 1,
    "We also used straw bale infill for our library, which has zero embodied energy.": 1,
    " When it comes time to sheetrock, if you use echo rock, it's about a quarter of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock.": 1,
    " And then you get to the finishes, the subjects of all of those go green articles.": 1,
    "And on the scale of a house, they almost make no difference at all.": 1,
    "And yet all the press is focused on that.": 1,
    " except for flooring.": 1,
    "If you put carpeting in your house, it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house, unless you use concrete or wood for a much lower embodied energy.": 1,
    " So now we add in the final construction energy, we add it all up, and we build a house for less than half of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this.": 1,
    "But before we pat ourselves too much on the back,": 1,
    " we have poured 151 megawatt hours of energy into constructing this house when there was a house there before.": 1,
    " And so the question is, how could we make that back?": 1,
    "And so if I run my new energy efficient house forward compared to the old non-energy efficient house, we make it back in about six years.": 1,
    " Now, I probably would have upgraded the old house to be more energy efficient.": 1,
    "And if that case, it would take me more about 20 years to break even.": 1,
    " Now, if I hadn't paid attention to embodied energy, it would have taken us over 50 years to break even compared to the upgraded house.": 1,
    "So what does this mean?": 1,
    " On the scale of my portion of the house, this is equivalent to about as much as I drive in a year.": 1,
    "It's about five times as much as if I went entirely vegetarian, but my elephant in the living room flies.": 1,
    " Clearly, I need to walk home from TED.": 1,
    "But all the calculations for embodied energy are on the blog.": 1,
    "And remember, it's sometimes the things that you are not expecting to be the biggest changes that are.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
