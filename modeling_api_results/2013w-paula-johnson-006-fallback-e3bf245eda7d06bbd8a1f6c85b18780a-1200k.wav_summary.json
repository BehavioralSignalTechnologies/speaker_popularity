    " Some of my most wonderful memories of childhood are of spending time with my grandmother, Mamar, in our four family home in Brooklyn, New York.": 1,
    "Her apartment was an oasis.": 1,
    " It was a place where I could sneak a cup of coffee which was really warm milk with just like a touch of caffeine.": 1,
    "She loved life.": 1,
    " And although she worked in a factory, she saved her pennies and she traveled to Europe.": 1,
    "And I remember pouring over those pictures with her and then dancing with her to her favorite music.": 1,
    " And then when I was eight and she was 60, something changed.": 1,
    "She no longer worked or traveled.": 1,
    "She no longer danced.": 1,
    "There were no more coffee times.": 1,
    " My mother missed work and took her to doctors who couldn't make a diagnosis.": 1,
    "And my father, who worked at night, would spend every afternoon with her just to make sure she ate.": 1,
    " Her care became all consuming for our family.": 1,
    "And by time a diagnosis was made, she was in a deep spiral.": 1,
    "Now, many of you will recognize her symptoms.": 1,
    "My grandmother had depression.": 1,
    " a deep, life-altering depression from which she never recovered.": 1,
    " And back then, so little was known about depression, but even today, 50 years later.": 1,
    " there's still so much more to learn.": 1,
    " Today, we know that women are 70% more likely to experience depression over their lifetimes compared with men.": 1,
    " And even with this high prevalence, women are misdiagnosed between 30 and 50 percent of the time.": 1,
    " Now we know that women are more likely to experience the symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance.": 1,
    " pain and anxiety compared with men, and these symptoms are often overlooked as symptoms of depression.": 1,
    " And it isn't only depression in which these sex differences occur, but they occur across so many diseases.": 1,
    " So it's my grandmother's struggles that have really led me on a lifelong quest.": 1,
    "And today I lead a center in which": 1,
    " The mission is to discover why these sex differences occur and to use that knowledge to improve the health of women.": 1,
    " Today, we know that every cell has a sex.": 1,
    " Now, that's a term coined by the Institute of Medicine.": 1,
    "And what it means is that men and women are different down to the cellular and molecular levels.": 1,
    " It means that we're different across all of our organs, from our brains to our hearts, our lungs, our joints.": 1,
    " Now, it was only 20 years ago.": 1,
    " that we hardly had any data on women's health beyond our reproductive functions.": 1,
    "But then in 1993, the NIH Revitalization Act was signed into law.": 1,
    " And what this law did was it mandated that women and minorities be included in clinical trials that were funded by the National Institutes of Health.": 1,
    " And in many ways, the law has worked.": 1,
    "Women are now routinely included in clinical studies, and we've learned that there are major differences in the ways that women and men experience disease.": 1,
    "But remarkably,": 1,
    " What we have learned about these differences is often overlooked.": 1,
    " So we have to ask ourselves the question, why leave women's health to chance?": 1,
    " And we're leaving it to chance in two ways.": 1,
    "The first is that there is so much more to learn, and we're not making the investment in fully understanding the extent of these sex differences.": 1,
    "And the second": 1,
    " is that we aren't taking what we have learned and routinely applying it in clinical care.": 1,
    "We are just not doing enough.": 1,
    " So I'm going to share with you three examples of where sex differences have impacted the health of women and where we need to do more.": 1,
    " Let's start with heart disease.": 1,
    "It's the number one killer of women in the United States today.": 1,
    " This is the face of heart disease.": 1,
    " Linda is a middle-aged woman who had a stent placed in one of the arteries going to her heart.": 1,
    "When she had recurrent symptoms, she went back to her doctor.": 1,
    "Her doctor did the gold standard test of cardiac catheterization.": 1,
    " It showed no blockages.": 1,
    "Linda's symptoms continued.": 1,
    "She had to stop working.": 1,
    "And that's when she found us.": 1,
    " When Linda came to us, we did another cardiac catheterization.": 1,
    "And this time, we found clues.": 1,
    "But we needed another test to make the diagnosis.": 1,
    " So we did a test called an intracarotary ultrasound where you use sound waves to look at the artery from the inside out.": 1,
    " And what we found was that Linda's disease didn't look like the typical male disease.": 1,
    " The typical male disease looks like this.": 1,
    " There's a discrete blockage or stenosis.": 1,
    "Linda's disease, like the disease of so many women,": 1,
    " looks like this.": 1,
    "The plaque is laid down more evenly, more diffusely along the artery, and it's harder to see.": 1,
    " So for Linda and for so many women, the gold standard test wasn't gold.": 1,
    " Now, Linda received the right treatment.": 1,
    "She went back to her life and fortunately today she is doing well.": 1,
    "But Linda was lucky.": 1,
    "She found us.": 1,
    "We found her disease.": 1,
    "But for too many women, that's not the case.": 1,
    "We have": 1,
    " the tools, we have the technology to make the diagnosis, but it's all too often that these sex differences are overlooked.": 1,
    " So what about treatment?": 1,
    "A landmark study that was published two years ago asked the very important question, what are the most effective treatments for heart disease in women?": 1,
    " The authors looked at papers written over a 10 year period and hundreds had to be thrown out.": 1,
    "And what they found out was that of those that were tossed out,": 1,
    " 65% were excluded because even though women were included in the studies, the analysis didn't differentiate between women and men.": 1,
    " What a lost opportunity.": 1,
    " You know, the money had been spent, and we didn't learn how women fared.": 1,
    "And these studies could not contribute one iota to the very, very important question.": 1,
    "What are the most effective treatments for heart disease in women?": 1,
    " I want to introduce you to Hortense, my godmother.": 1,
    " Hongwei, a relative of a colleague, and somebody you may recognize, Dana, Christopher Reeve's wife.": 1,
    " All three women have something very important in common.": 1,
    "All three were diagnosed with lung cancer, the number one cancer killer of women in the United States today.": 1,
    " All three were non-smokers.": 1,
    " Sadly, Dana and Hongwei died of their disease.": 1,
    " Today what we know is that women who are non-smokers are three times more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than are men who are non-smokers.": 1,
    " Now interestingly, when women are diagnosed with lung cancer, their survival tends to be better than that of men.": 1,
    "Now here are some clues.": 1,
    " Our investigators have found that there are certain genes in the lung tumor cells of both women and men.": 1,
    "And these genes are activated mainly by estrogen.": 1,
    " And when these genes are overexpressed, it's associated with improved survival only in young women.": 1,
    " Now this is a very early finding and we don't yet know whether it has relevance to clinical care.": 1,
    " But it's findings like this that may provide hope and may provide an opportunity to save lives of both women and men.": 1,
    " Now let me share with you an example of when we do consider sex differences, it can drive the science.": 1,
    "Several years ago, a new lung cancer drug was being evaluated.": 1,
    " And when the authors looked at whose tumor shrank, they found that 82% were women.": 1,
    " This led them to ask the question, well, why?": 1,
    "And what they found was that the genetic mutations that the drug targeted were far more common in women.": 1,
    "And what this has led to is a more personalized approach.": 1,
    " to the treatment of lung cancer that also includes sex.": 1,
    "This is what we can accomplish when we don't leave women's health to chance.": 1,
    " We know that when you invest in research, you get results.": 1,
    "Take a look at the death rate from breast cancer over time.": 1,
    "And now take a look at the death rates from lung cancer in women over time.": 1,
    " Now let's look at the dollars invested in breast cancer.": 1,
    "These are the dollars invested per death and the dollars invested in lung cancer.": 1,
    " Now it's clear that our investment in breast cancer has produced results.": 1,
    "They may not be fast enough.": 1,
    " but it has produced results.": 1,
    "We can do the same for lung cancer and for every other disease.": 1,
    " So let's go back to depression.": 1,
    " Depression is the number one cause of disability in women in the world today.": 1,
    " our investigators have found that there are differences in the brains of women and men in the areas that are connected with mood.": 1,
    " And when you put men and women in a functional MRI scanner, that's the kind of scanner that shows how the brain is functioning when it's activated.": 1,
    "So you put them in the scanner and you expose them to stress.": 1,
    " you can actually see the difference.": 1,
    " And it's findings like this that we believe hold some of the clues for why we see these very significant sex differences in depression.": 1,
    " But even though we know that these differences occur.": 1,
    " 66% of the brain research that begins in animals.": 1,
    " is done in either male animals or animals in whom the sex is not identified.": 1,
    " So I think we have to ask again the question, why leave women's health to chance?": 1,
    " And this is a question that haunts those of us in science and medicine who believe that we are on the verge of being able to dramatically improve the health of women.": 1,
    " We know that every cell has a sex.": 1,
    "We know that these differences are often overlooked, and therefore we know that women are not getting the full benefit of modern science and medicine today.": 1,
    " We have the tools, but we lack the collective will and momentum.": 1,
    " Women's health is an equal rights issue, as important as equal pay.": 1,
    "And it's an issue of the quality and the integrity of science and medicine.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " So imagine the momentum we could achieve in advancing the health of women if we considered whether these sex differences were present at the very beginning of designing research.": 1,
    " or if we analyzed their data by sex.": 1,
    " So people often ask me, what can I do?": 1,
    "And here's what I suggest.": 1,
    " First, I suggest that you think about women's health in the same way that you think and care about other causes that are important to you.": 1,
    " And second, and equally as important, that as a woman": 1,
    " You have to ask your doctor and the doctors who are caring for those who you love, is this disease or treatment different in women?": 1,
    " Now this is a profound question because the answer is likely yes, but your doctor may not know the answer, at least not yet.": 1,
    "But if you ask the question,": 1,
    " your doctor will very likely go looking for the answer.": 1,
    "And this is so important, not only for ourselves,": 1,
    " but for all of those whom we love, whether it be a mother, a daughter, a sister, a friend, or a grandmother.": 1,
    " It was my grandmother's suffering that inspired my work to improve the health of women.": 1,
    " That's her legacy.": 1,
    " our legacy can be to improve the health of women for this generation and for generations to come.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
