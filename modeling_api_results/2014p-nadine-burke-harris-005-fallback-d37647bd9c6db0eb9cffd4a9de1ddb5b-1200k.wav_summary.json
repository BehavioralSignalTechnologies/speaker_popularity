    " In the mid-90s, the CDC and Kaiser Permanente discovered an exposure that dramatically increased the risk for seven out of 10 of the leading causes of death in the United States.": 1,
    " In high doses, it affects brain development, the immune system, hormonal systems, and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed.": 1,
    " Folks who are exposed in very high doses have triple the lifetime risk of heart disease and lung cancer and a 20-year difference in life expectancy.": 1,
    " And yet, doctors today are not trained in routine screening or treatment.": 1,
    "Now, the exposure I'm talking about is not a pesticide or a packaging chemical.": 1,
    "It's childhood trauma.": 1,
    " Okay, what kind of trauma am I talking about here?": 1,
    "I'm not talking about failing a test or losing a basketball game.": 1,
    "I am talking about threats that are so severe or pervasive": 1,
    " that they literally get under our skin and change our physiology.": 1,
    "Things like abuse or neglect, or growing up with a parent who struggles with mental illness or substance dependence.": 1,
    " Now, for a long time, I viewed these things in the way I was trained to view them, either as a social problem, refer to social services, or as a mental health problem, refer to mental health services.": 1,
    " And then something happened to make me rethink my entire approach.": 1,
    "When I finished my residency, I wanted to go someplace where I felt really needed, someplace where I could make a difference.": 1,
    " So I came to work for California Pacific Medical Center, one of the best private hospitals in Northern California, and together we opened a clinic in Bayview-Hunters Point.": 1,
    " one of the poorest, most underserved neighborhoods in San Francisco.": 1,
    " Now prior to that point, there had been only one pediatrician in all of Bayview to serve more than 10,000 children.": 1,
    "So we hung a shingle and we were able to provide top quality care regardless of ability to pay.": 1,
    " It was so cool.": 1,
    "We targeted the typical health disparities, access to care, immunization rates, asthma hospitalization rates, and we hit all of our numbers.": 1,
    "We felt very proud of ourselves.": 1,
    " But then I started noticing a disturbing trend.": 1,
    "A lot of kids were being referred to me for ADHD or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.": 1,
    "But when I actually did": 1,
    " thorough history and physical.": 1,
    "What I found was that for most of my patients, I couldn't make a diagnosis of ADHD.": 1,
    "Most of the kids I was seeing had experienced such severe trauma.": 1,
    " that it felt like something else was going on.": 1,
    "Somehow, I was missing something important.": 1,
    " Now, before I did my residency, I did a master's degree in public health.": 1,
    "And one of the things that they teach you in public health school is that if you're a doctor and you see a hundred kids that all drink from the same well,": 1,
    " and 98 of them develop diarrhea, you can go ahead and write that prescription for dose after dose after dose of antibiotics.": 1,
    " Or you can walk over and say, what the hell is in this well?": 1,
    "So I began reading everything that I could get my hands on about how exposure to adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children.": 1,
    " And then one day, my colleague walked into my office and he said, Dr. Burke, have you seen this?": 1,
    " In his hand was a copy of a research study called the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study.": 1,
    "That day changed my clinical practice and ultimately my career.": 1,
    " The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study is something that everybody needs to know about.": 1,
    "It was done by Dr. Vince Felitti at Kaiser and Dr. Bob Anda at the CDC, and together they asked": 1,
    " 17,500 adults about their history of exposure to what they called Adverse Childhood Experiences, or ACEs.": 1,
    " Those include physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, physical or emotional neglect, parental mental illness, substance dependence, incarceration, parental separation or divorce,": 1,
    " or domestic violence.": 1,
    "For every yes, you would get a point on your A score.": 1,
    "And then what they did was they correlated these A scores against health outcomes.": 1,
    " what they found was striking.": 1,
    "Two things.": 1,
    "Number one, aces are incredibly common.": 1,
    " 67% of the population had at least one ace, and 12.6%, one in eight, had four or more aces.": 1,
    " The second thing that they found was that there was a dose response relationship between ACEs and health outcomes.": 1,
    " The higher your A score, the worse your health outcomes.": 1,
    "For a person with an A score of four or more, their relative risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was two and a half times that of someone with an A score of zero.": 1,
    " For hepatitis, it was also two and a half times.": 1,
    "For depression, it was four and a half times.": 1,
    "For suicidality, it was 12 times.": 1,
    " A person with an A score of seven or more had triple the lifetime risk of lung cancer and three and a half times the risk of ischemic heart disease, the number one killer in the United States of America.": 1,
    " Well, of course, this makes sense.": 1,
    "You know, some people looked at this data and they said, come on.": 1,
    " You know, you have a rough childhood.": 1,
    "You're more likely to drink and smoke and do all these things that are going to ruin your health.": 1,
    "This isn't science.": 1,
    "This is just bad behavior.": 1,
    " It turns out this is exactly where the science comes in.": 1,
    "We now understand better than we ever have before.": 1,
    " how exposure to early adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children.": 1,
    "It affects areas like the nucleus accumbens, the pleasure and reward center of the brain that is implicated in substance dependence.": 1,
    " It inhibits the prefrontal cortex, which is necessary for impulse control and executive function, a critical area for learning.": 1,
    " And on MRI scans, we see measurable differences in the amygdala, the brain's fear response center.": 1,
    " So there are real neurologic reasons why folks exposed to high doses of adversity are more likely to engage in high risk behavior.": 1,
    "And that's important to know.": 1,
    " But it turns out that even if you don't engage in any high-risk behavior, you're still more likely to develop heart disease or cancer.": 1,
    " The reason for this has to do with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the brain's and body's stress response system that governs our fight or flight response.": 1,
    " How does it work?": 1,
    "Well, imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear.": 1,
    "Immediately, your hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary, would send a signal to your adrenal gland that says, release stress hormones, adrenaline, cortisol.": 1,
    " until your heart starts to pound, your pupils dilate, your airways open up, and you are ready to either fight that bear,": 1,
    " or run from the bear.": 1,
    "And that is wonderful if you're in a forest and there's a bear.": 1,
    " But the problem...": 1,
    " is what happens when the bear comes home every night.": 1,
    "And this system is activated over and over and over again.": 1,
    "And it goes from being adaptive or life-saving": 1,
    " to maladaptive or health damaging.": 1,
    "Children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation because their brains and bodies are just developing.": 1,
    " High doses of adversity not only affect brain structure and function, they affect the developing immune system.": 1,
    " developing hormonal systems, and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed.": 1,
    " So for me, this information threw my old training out the window, because when we understand the mechanism of a disease, when we know not only which pathways are disrupted, but how,": 1,
    " then as doctors, it is our job to use this science for prevention and treatment.": 1,
    "That's what we do.": 1,
    " So in San Francisco, we created the Center for Youth Wellness to prevent, screen, and heal the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress.": 1,
    " We started simply with routine screening of every one of our kids at their regular physical, because I know": 1,
    " Though if my patient has an A score of four, she's two and a half times as likely to develop hepatitis or COPD.": 1,
    "She's four and a half times as likely to become depressed, and she's 12 times as likely to attempt to take her own life.": 1,
    " as my patient was zero ACES.": 1,
    "I know that when she's in my exam room.": 1,
    "For our patients who do screen positive,": 1,
    " We have a multidisciplinary treatment team that works to reduce the dose of adversity and treat symptoms using best practices, including home visits, care coordination, mental health care, nutrition.": 1,
    " holistic interventions, and yes, medication when necessary.": 1,
    "But we also educate parents about the impact of ACEs and toxic stress the same way you would for covering electrical outlets or lead poisoning.": 1,
    " And we tailor the care of our asthmatics and our diabetics in a way that recognizes that they may need more aggressive treatment given the changes to their hormonal and immune systems.": 1,
    " So the other thing that happens when you understand this science is that you want to shout it from the rooftops, because this isn't just an issue for kids in Bayview.": 1,
    " I figured the minute that everybody else heard about this, it would be routine screening, multidisciplinary treatment teams, and it would be a race to the most effective clinical treatment protocols.": 1,
    " Yeah, that did not happen.": 1,
    " And that was a huge learning for me.": 1,
    "What I had thought of as simply best clinical practice, I now understand to be a movement.": 1,
    " In the words of Dr. Robert Block, the former president of the American Academy of Pediatrics,": 1,
    " are the single greatest unaddressed public health threat facing our nation today.": 1,
    " And for a lot of people, that's a terrifying prospect.": 1,
    "The scope and scale of the problem seems so large that it feels overwhelming to think about how we might approach it.": 1,
    "But for me,": 1,
    " That's actually where the hope lies.": 1,
    "Because when we have the right framework, when we recognize this to be a public health crisis,": 1,
    " then we can begin to use the right toolkit to come up with solutions.": 1,
    "From tobacco to lead poisoning to HIV AIDS, the United States actually has quite a strong track record": 1,
    " with addressing public health problems.": 1,
    " But replicating those successes with ACEs and toxic stress is going to take determination and commitment.": 1,
    "And when I look at what our nation's response has been so far,": 1,
    " I wonder.": 1,
    " Why haven't we taken this more seriously?": 1,
    " You know, at first, I thought that we marginalized the issue because it doesn't apply to us, right?": 1,
    "That's an issue for those kids in those neighborhoods, which is weird because the data doesn't bear that out.": 1,
    " The original ACEs study was done in a population that was 70% Caucasian, 70% college educated.": 1,
    "But then, the more I talked to folks,": 1,
    " I'm beginning to think that maybe I had it completely backwards.": 1,
    " If I were to ask, how many people in this room grew up with a family member who suffered from mental illness?": 1,
    " I bet a few hands would go up.": 1,
    " And then if I were to ask how many folks had a parent who maybe drank too much or who really believed that if you spare the rod, you spoil the child.": 1,
    " I bet a few more hands would go up.": 1,
    " Even in this room, this is an issue that touches many of us.": 1,
    "And I'm beginning to believe that we marginalize the issue because it does apply to us.": 1,
    " Maybe it's easier to see in other zip codes because we don't want to look at it.": 1,
    "We'd rather be sick.": 1,
    " Fortunately, scientific advances and, frankly, economic realities make that option less viable every day.": 1,
    " The science is clear.": 1,
    "Early adversity dramatically affects health across a lifetime.": 1,
    " Today we are beginning to understand how to interrupt the progression from early adversity to disease and early death.": 1,
    " And 30 years from now, the child who has a high A score and whose behavioral symptoms go unrecognized": 1,
    " whose asthma management is not connected, and who goes on to develop high blood pressure and early heart disease or cancer,": 1,
    " will be just as anomalous as a six-month mortality from HIV AIDS.": 1,
    "People will look at that situation and say, what the heck happened there?": 1,
    " This is treatable.": 1,
    "This is beatable.": 1,
    "The single most important thing that we need today is the courage to look this problem in the face": 1,
    " and say, this is real and this is all of us.": 1,
    "I believe that we are the movement.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
