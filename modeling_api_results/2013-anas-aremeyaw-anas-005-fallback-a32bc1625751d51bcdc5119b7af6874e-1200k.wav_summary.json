    "Thank you.": 2,
    "Yes.": 2,
    " I am sorry I cannot show you my face.": 1,
    " Because if I do, the bad guys will come at me.": 1,
    " My journey started 14 years ago.": 1,
    " I was a young reporter.": 1,
    "I had just come out of college.": 1,
    " Then I got a scoop.": 1,
    " The scoop was quite a very simple story.": 1,
    "Police officers were taking bribes from hawkers who were hawking on the streets.": 1,
    " As a young reporter, I thought that I should do it in a different way so that it has a maximum impact, since everybody knew that was happening.": 1,
    "And yet, there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system.": 1,
    "So I decided to go there.": 1,
    " and acts as a seller.": 1,
    "As part of selling, I was able to document the hardcore evidence.": 1,
    " The impact was great.": 1,
    " It was fantastic.": 1,
    " This is what many call immersion journalism or undercover journalism.": 1,
    " I am an undercover journalist.": 1,
    " My journalism is hinged on three basic principles.": 1,
    " naming, shaming, and jailing.": 1,
    " Journalism is about results.": 1,
    "It's about affecting your community or your society in the most progressive way.": 1,
    " I have worked on this for over 14 years, and I can tell you the results are very good.": 1,
    "One story that comes to mind in my undercover pieces is spirit child.": 1,
    " It was about children who were born with deformities.": 1,
    "And the parents felt that once they were born with those deformities, they were not good enough to live in the society.": 1,
    "So they were given some concoction to take.": 1,
    " And as a result, they died.": 1,
    "So I built a prosthetic baby.": 1,
    " And I went into the village, pretended as though this baby had been born with a deformity.": 1,
    "And here was the guys who do the killing.": 1,
    "They got themselves ready.": 1,
    " In a bid to kill, I got the police on standby.": 1,
    "And they came that fateful morning to come and kill the child.": 1,
    " I recall how they were seriously boiling the concoction.": 1,
    "They put it on fire.": 1,
    "It was boiling hot, getting ready to give to the kids.": 1,
    "Whilst this was going on, the police, I had alerted the police.": 1,
    "They were on the standby.": 1,
    " And just as the concussion was ready, and they were about to give it to their kids, I phoned the police.": 1,
    "And fortunately, they came and busted them.": 1,
    " As I speak now, you are before the courts.": 1,
    "Don't forget the key principles, naming, shaming, and jailing.": 1,
    " The court process is taking place.": 1,
    "And I'm very sure at the end of the day, we'll find them and we'll put them where they belong to.": 1,
    " Another key story that comes to mind which relates to this spiritual phenomenon is the spell of the albino.": 1,
    " I'm sure most of you may have heard, in Tanzania, children who are born with albinism are sometimes considered as being unfit to live in the society.": 1,
    " Their bodies are chopped off with machetes.": 1,
    "And it's supposed to be used for some concoctions or some potions for people to get money or some many, many stories people say about it.": 1,
    " it was time to go undercover again.": 1,
    "So I went undercover.": 1,
    " as a man who was interested in this particular business, of course.": 1,
    "Again, a prosthetic arm was built.": 1,
    "For the first time, I filmed on hidden camera the guys who do this.": 1,
    "And they were ready to buy the arm.": 1,
    " And they were ready to use it to prepare those portions for people.": 1,
    "I am glad today that the Tanzanian government has taken action.": 1,
    " But the key issue is that the Tanzanian government could have only taken action because the evidence was available.": 1,
    "My journalism is about hardcore evidence.": 1,
    " If I say you have stolen, I show you the evidence that you have stolen.": 1,
    "I show you how you stole it and when or what you used what you had stolen to do.": 1,
    "What is the essence of journalism if it doesn't benefit society?": 1,
    " My kind of journalism is a product of my society.": 1,
    " I know that sometimes people have their own criticisms about undercover journalism.": 1,
    " he brought out some money from his pockets.": 1,
    " and put it on the table.": 1,
    " that we should not be afraid.": 1,
    " He wants to bring the cuckoo and send it to Cote d'Ivoire.": 1,
    " So with my hidden intention, I kept quiet.": 1,
    "I didn't alter a word, but my colleagues didn't know.": 1,
    "So after, after collection of the money,": 1,
    " When he left, we were waiting for him to bring the goods.": 1,
    "We decided immediately he left.": 1,
    "I told my colleagues that, since I was the leader of the group, I told my colleagues that if they come, we arrest them.": 1,
    "I don't even know the place called...": 1,
    " I've never stepped there before so I'm surprised.": 1,
    "You see a hand counting money just in front of me.": 1,
    "The next moment you see the money": 1,
    " in my hands, counting, whereas I have not come in contact with anybody, I have not done any business with anybody.": 1,
    "When Metro News contacted investigative reporter Anas Arimiya Anas for his reaction,": 1,
    " He just smiled and gave this video extract he did not use in the documentary recently shown on screen.": 1,
    " the officer who earlier denied involvement picks a calculator to compute the amount of money they will charge on the cocoa to be smuggled.": 1,
    " This was another story on anti-corruption.": 1,
    "And here was him denying.": 1,
    "But you see, when you have the hard core evidence, you are able to affect society.": 1,
    " Sometimes these are some of the headlines that come.": 1,
    " What Ana said is not something which is unknown to many of us, but please, those of you who are agents and who are leading the customs officers into temptation,": 1,
    " I'm telling you, Ghana is not going to say any good things to you about them.": 1,
    "That was my president.": 1,
    " I thought that I couldn't come here without giving you something special.": 1,
    "I have a piece, and I'm excited that I'm sharing it for the first time with you here.": 1,
    "I have been undercover in the prisons.": 1,
    " I have been there for a long time.": 1,
    " And I can tell you.": 1,
    " What I saw is not nice.": 1,
    "But again, I can only affect society and affect government if I bring out the hardcore evidence.": 1,
    "Many times, the prison authorities have denied": 1,
    " ever having issues of drug abuse, issues of sodomy, issues of so many issues, they would deny that it never happened.": 1,
    "How can you obtain the hardcore evidence?": 1,
    "So I was in the prison.": 1,
    " Now, what you are seeing is a pile of dead bodies.": 1,
    "Now, I happen to have followed one of my inmates, one of my friends, from his sick bed to death.": 1,
    "And I can tell you, it was not a nice thing at all.": 1,
    " There were issues of bad food being served us.": 1,
    "I recall that some of the food I ate is just not good for a human being.": 1,
    " toilet facilities very bad.": 1,
    " I mean, you have to queue to get proper toilets to attend.": 1,
    "And that is what I even call proper when the four of us are on a manhole.": 1,
    " It is something that if you narrated to somebody, the person won't believe.": 1,
    "The only way that you can let the person believe is when you show hardcore evidence.": 1,
    "Of course, drugs was abandoned.": 1,
    " It was easier to get cannabis, heroin, and cocaine faster even in the prison than outside the prison.": 1,
    "Evil in the society is an extreme disease.": 1,
    "If you have extreme diseases,": 1,
    " you need to get extreme remedies.": 1,
    "My kind of journalism might not fit in other continents or other countries, but I can tell you it works in my part of the continent, Africa.": 1,
    "Because usually when people talk about corruption, they ask,": 1,
    " Where is the evidence?": 1,
    "Show me the evidence.": 1,
    "I say, this is the evidence.": 1,
    "And that has aided in me putting a lot of people behind bars.": 1,
    " You see, we on the continent are able to tell the story better because we face the conditions and we see the conditions.": 1,
    " That is why I was particularly excited when we launched our Africa Investigate Series, where we investigated a lot of African countries.": 1,
    " As a result of the Success of Africa Investigates series, we are moving on to World Investigate.": 1,
    "By the end of it, a lot more bad guys on our continent will be put behind bars.": 1,
    " This will not stop.": 1,
    "I'm going to carry on with this kind of journalism, because I know that when evil men destroy, good men must build and bind.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    "I have some questions for you.": 1,
    "How did you end up in jail?": 1,
    "This was just a few weeks ago, I believe, yeah?": 1,
    "Sure.": 1,
    "You know, undercover is all about setting the priorities right.": 1,
    "So we got people to take me to court.": 1,
    " And so I went through the very legal process.": 1,
    "Because at the end of the day, the prison authorities want to check whether indeed you have been there or not.": 1,
    "And that's how I got in there.": 1,
    " So someone sued you in court and they took you there and you were in remand custody for part of it?": 1,
    "And you did that deliberately?": 1,
    " Talk to me just about fear and how you manage that, because you're regularly putting your life at risk.": 1,
    "How do you do that?": 1,
    "You see, undercover is always a last resort.": 1,
    " Before we go undercover, we follow the rules.": 1,
    "And I'm only comfortable and I'm page of fear whenever I am sure that all the steps.": 1,
    " have been taken.": 1,
    "I don't do it alone.": 1,
    "I have a backup team who help ensure that the safety and all that systems are put in place.": 1,
    "But you've got to take very intelligent decisions whenever they are happening.": 1,
    "If you don't, you will end up losing your life.": 1,
    " So yes, when the backup systems are put in place, I'm OK.": 1,
    "I go in.": 1,
    "Risky, yes, but it's a hazard of a profession.": 1,
    "Everybody has the hazard.": 1,
    "And once you say that is yours, you've got to take it as and when it comes.": 1,
    " Well, you're an amazing human, and you've done amazing work, and you've told us a story like no story I think any of us have heard before.": 1,
    "And we're appreciative.": 1,
    "We salute you.": 1,
    "Thank you so much, Anas.": 1,
    "Stay safe.": 1
