    " sculpture I made which is": 1,
    " a way of freeing a form into an object that has different degrees of freedom.": 1,
    " Balance on a point.": 1,
    "This is a bronze ball and aluminum arm here and then this.": 1,
    " wooden disk and so the wooden disk was really thought about as something that you'd want to hold on to and that would glide easily through your hands.": 1,
    " and the aluminum is because it's very light.": 1,
    "The bronze is nice hard durable material that could roll on the ground and the": 1,
    " Inside of the bronze ball there's a lead weight that's free swinging on an axle that's on two bearings that pass in between across it like this, that counterbalance.": 1,
    " this weight, so it allows it to roll.": 1,
    "And the sphere has that balance property that it always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction.": 1,
    " If you put something on top of it, it misbalances it, and so it would tip over.": 1,
    "But in this case, because the interior is free swinging in relation to the sphere, it can stand up on one point.": 1,
    " And then there was a second level to this object, which is that I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in, which is the diameter of the moon.": 1,
    " and the diameter of the Earth in proportion to each other.": 1,
    " I was exploring really early on, wanting to make things float in the air, and I thought up a lot of ideas.": 1,
    "This is a sculpture that I made that": 1,
    " It's magnetically levitated.": 1,
    "The thing is, it's slightly dangerous, and normally it's sort of cordoned off when it's in a museum.": 1,
    "But let's see if I can manipulate it a little bit without...": 1,
    " So this is just floating on a permanent magnetic field, which stabilizes it in all directions, except there's a slight tether here.": 1,
    " which keeps it from going over the top of its field.": 1,
    "It serves surfing on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave.": 1,
    "And that's what supports the object and keeps it stable.": 1,
    " I think we could roll the tape.": 1,
    "I have a collection of videos that I took of different installations which I could narrate.": 1,
    "This is a sculpture of the sun.": 1,
    " and the Earth in proportion, representing that eight and a half minutes that takes light and gravity to connect the two.": 1,
    "So here's the Earth, it's a little less than a millimeter that was turned to solid bronze.": 1,
    " And here's a similar sculpture.": 1,
    "That's the sun at that end.": 1,
    "And then in a series of 55 balls, it reduces proportionately.": 1,
    "Each ball and the spaces between them reduce proportionately.": 1,
    " until you get down to this little earth.": 1,
    "This is in a sculpture park in Tianjin.": 1,
    " This one is about the moon and then the distance to the Earth in proportion.": 1,
    "Also, this is a little stone ball floating.": 1,
    "You see the little tether, but it's also magnetically levitated.": 1,
    " And then this is the first part of, this is 109 spheres since the sun is 109 times the diameter of the earth.": 1,
    "And so this is the size of the sun and then each of these little spheres": 1,
    " is the size of the earth in proportion to the sun.": 1,
    "It's made up of 16 concentric shells.": 1,
    "Each one has 92 spheres.": 1,
    "And this was in the courtyard of a 12th century alchemist.": 1,
    "And I was thinking of the sun as the ultimate alchemist.": 1,
    " So this again is on the subject, the slice from the equator of the Earth, and then the moon in the center, and it's floating.": 1,
    "This is in France.": 1,
    " This is in Sapporo, and it's balancing on a shaft and a ball right at the center of gravity, or just slightly above the center of gravity, which": 1,
    " means that the lower half of the object is just a little bit more weighty, so you can see it rotating here, and it weighs about a ton or over a ton.": 1,
    "It's made of stainless steel, quite thick, but it's being balanced like that in equilibrium.": 1,
    " susceptible to motion by the air currents.": 1,
    " This is another species of work that I do.": 1,
    "These are arrays, and these spheres are all suspended, but they have magnets horizontally in them.": 1,
    " that make them all like compasses.": 1,
    "So all the red sides, for example, face one direction south, and the blue side, the complement, faces the other way.": 1,
    "So as you turn around, you're seeing different colors.": 1,
    " This is based on the structure of a diamond.": 1,
    "It was a diamond cell structure, was the point of departure, and then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows.": 1,
    " were between the atoms and so I placed one more element inside of each one of them.": 1,
    "These were white spheres and then I had video projectors that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres so that they would catch": 1,
    " parts of the images and make sort of three dimensional color volumes as you walk through it, through the object.": 1,
    " This is something I did of a tactile communication system.": 1,
    "It was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture and then putting it into a communication system.": 1,
    " an idea of moving a sculpture, a ball, that would be directed around the room by a computer.": 1,
    " This is a clock I designed.": 1,
    "It says Buckminster Fuller's Dimaxium map, edited here.": 1,
    "It turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth.": 1,
    " And then this is like projects that are harder to build.": 1,
    "This has a diamond-bottomed lake, so it's a floating island with water, fresh water.": 1,
    " that can fly from place to place, be grown, I suppose, with nanotechnology in the future sometime.": 1,
    " In the course of doing my work, I sort of have a broad range of interests and some of it is just the idea of creating media as a sculpture.": 1,
    " something that would keep the sculpture fresh and ever-changing by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of.": 1,
    " I had a lot of, always interested in the concept of a crystal ball and the idea that you could see things inside of a crystal ball, predict the future.": 1,
    " or a television set where it's sort of like a magic box where anything can appear.": 1,
    " I had thought about a long time ago, in the late 60s, when I was just starting out, under the influence of thinking about": 1,
    " Buckminster Fuller's grand project for an electric globe across from the United Nations and": 1,
    " and other things that were happening to space program at that time and whole earth catalog things like that.": 1,
    "I was thinking about mass produced spherical television sets that could be linked to orbiting camera satellites.": 1,
    " And so, if I could roll the next film here.": 1,
    " This has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations, but the current version of it is a flying airship that's about 35 meters in diameter, about 110 feet.": 1,
    " diameter, and the whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes, red, blue, and green, that allow you to have a high resolution picture visible in daylight.": 1,
    " And I came with a plan, I brought it to Paul McCready's company Arrow Environment to do a feasibility study and they analyzed it.": 1,
    " came up with a lot of innovative ideas of how to propel it so we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen and this is the control room inside of": 1,
    " the ship.": 1,
    "And the idea of this Air Genie is it's something that can just transform and become anything and it's like a traveling show.": 1,
    "It has speakers on it and it has cameras.": 1,
    " over the surface of it so it can see its environment and then it can mimic its environment and disappear and hear the legs are retracting and the cabin is open or closed as you like.": 1,
    "Ways about": 1,
    " twenty tons it has on board generators about can generate about a million kilowatts and in order to be bright enough": 1,
    " to be visible in daylight.": 1,
    "And the idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show.": 1,
    "It really would be dedicated to": 1,
    " to the arts and to interacting and there would be on board a crew of artists, musicians that would allow the thing to become": 1,
    " actually kind of a conscious object that would respond to the moment and to interact as an entity that was aware that could": 1,
    " communicate, and it's completely silent and non-polluting.": 1,
    "It has electric motors with a novel propulsion system.": 1,
    "It could be, you know, interacting with large crowds and": 1,
    " different ways.": 1,
    "Primarily, I would be interested in how it would interact with, say, going to a college campus and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences.": 1,
    " the world, the situation of the globe, the default image on the object would probably be a high resolution Earth image, but then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or": 1,
    " global warming issues or migrations, all of the things that we're concerned with today.": 1,
    "And then at night, the idea is that would be used as kind of a rave": 1,
    " situation where people could cut loose and the music and the lights and everything.": 1,
    "So it could land in a park, for example, or this could represent a": 1,
    " a college green, and then it would have a corresponding website that would show the itinerary of this, and so interacting with the same kind of imagery.": 1,
    "And then it would also": 1,
    " be able to be an open code so people could interact with it.": 1,
    "It would be a forum for people's ideas about what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type.": 1,
    "And so that's pretty much it.": 1,
    "OK, thank you.": 1
