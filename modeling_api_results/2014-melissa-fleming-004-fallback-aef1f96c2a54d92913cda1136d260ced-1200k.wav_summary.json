    " Thank you.": 2,
    " So I started working with refugees because I wanted to make a difference.": 1,
    "And making a difference starts with telling their stories.": 1,
    "So when I meet refugees, I always ask them questions.": 1,
    " Who bombed your house?": 1,
    " Who killed your son?": 1,
    "Did the rest of your family make it out alive?": 1,
    " How are you coping in your life in exile?": 1,
    "But there's one question that always seems to me to be most revealing, and that is, what did you take?": 1,
    " What was that most important thing that you had to take with you when the bombs were exploding in your town and the armed gangs were approaching your house?": 1,
    " A Syrian refugee boy I know told me that he didn't hesitate when his life was in imminent danger.": 1,
    "He took his high school diploma, and later he told me why.": 1,
    " He said, I took my high school diploma because my life depended on it.": 1,
    "And he would risk his life to get that diploma.": 1,
    "On his way to school, he would dodge snipers.": 1,
    " His classroom sometimes shook with the sound of bombs and shelling.": 1,
    "And his mother told me,": 1,
    " Every day, I would say to him every morning, honey, please don't go to school.": 1,
    "And when he insisted, she said, I would hug him as if it were for the last time.": 1,
    " But he said to his mother, we're all afraid, but our determination to graduate is stronger than our fear.": 1,
    " But one day, the family got terrible news.": 1,
    "Hani's aunt, his uncle, and his cousin were murdered in their homes for refusing to leave their house.": 1,
    "Their throats were slit.": 1,
    "It was time to flee.": 1,
    " They left that day right away in their car, Hani hidden in the back because they were facing checkpoints of menacing soldiers.": 1,
    "And they would cross the border into Lebanon where they would find peace.": 1,
    " but they would begin a life of grueling hardship and monotony.": 1,
    " They had no choice but to build a shack on the side of a muddy field, and this is Hani's brother Ashraf who plays outside.": 1,
    "And that day they joined the biggest population of refugees in the world.": 1,
    " In a country, Lebanon, that is tiny, it only has four million citizens, and there are one million Syrian refugees living there.": 1,
    "It is not a town, a city, or a village that is not host.": 1,
    " Syrian refugees.": 1,
    "This is generosity and humanity that is remarkable.": 1,
    " Think about it this way, proportionally, it would be as if the entire population of Germany, 80 million people, would flee to the United States in just three years.": 1,
    " Half of the entire population of Syria is now uprooted.": 1,
    "Most of them inside the country, six and a half million people have fled for their lives.": 1,
    " Over and well over three million people have crossed the borders and have found sanctuary in the neighboring countries.": 1,
    "And only a small proportion, as you see, have moved on to Europe.": 1,
    " What I find most worrying is that half of all Syrian refugees are children.": 1,
    "I took this picture of this little girl.": 1,
    "It was just two hours after she had arrived after a long trek from Syria into Jordan.": 1,
    " and most troubling of all.": 1,
    " is that only 20% of Syrian refugee children are in school in Lebanon.": 1,
    "And yet, Syrian refugee children, all refugee children, tell us": 1,
    " Education is the most important thing in their lives.": 1,
    "Why?": 1,
    "Because it allows them to think of their future rather than the nightmare of their past.": 1,
    "It allows them to think of hope.": 1,
    " rather than hatred.": 1,
    " I'm reminded of a recent visit I took to a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq, and I met this girl, and I thought she's beautiful, and I went up to her and asked her, can I take your picture?": 1,
    " And she said yes, but she refused to smile.": 1,
    " I think she couldn't, because I think she must realize that she represents a lost generation of Syrian refugee children.": 1,
    " A generation isolated and frustrated.": 1,
    "And yet, look at what they fled.": 1,
    " utter destruction.": 1,
    "Buildings, industries, schools, roads, homes.": 1,
    "Hani's home was also destroyed.": 1,
    "This will need to be rebuilt.": 1,
    " by architects, by engineers, by electricians.": 1,
    " Communities will need teachers and lawyers and politicians interested in reconciliation and not revenge.": 1,
    " Shouldn't this be rebuilt by the people with the largest stake, the societies in exile, the refugees?": 1,
    " Refugees have a lot of time to prepare for their return You might imagine that being a refugee is just a temporary state Well far from it": 1,
    " With wars going on and on, the average time a refugee will spend in exile is 17 years.": 1,
    " Hani was into his second year in limbo when I went to visit him recently.": 1,
    "And we conducted our entire conversation in English, which he confessed to me he learned from reading all of Dan Brown's novels.": 1,
    " And from listening to American rap.": 1,
    " We also spent some nice moments of laughter and fun with his beloved brother, Ashraf.": 1,
    " But I'll never forget what he told me when we ended our conversation that day.": 1,
    " He said to me, if I am not a student, I am nothing.": 1,
    " Hani is one of 50 million people uprooted in this world today.": 1,
    "Never since World War II have so many people been forcibly displaced.": 1,
    " So while we're making sweeping progress in human health,": 1,
    " in technology and education and design, we are doing dangerously little to help the victims.": 1,
    " And we're doing far too little to stop and prevent the wars that are driving them from their homes.": 1,
    "And there are more and more victims.": 1,
    " Every day, on average, by the end of this day, 32,000 people will be forcibly displaced from their homes.": 1,
    "32,000 people.": 1,
    " They flee across borders like this one.": 1,
    "We captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan, and this is a typical day.": 1,
    " or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats, risking their lives, in this case, just to reach safety in Europe.": 1,
    " This Syrian young man survived one of these boats that capsized most of the people drowned.": 1,
    "And he told us, Syrians are just looking for a quiet place.": 1,
    " where nobody hurts you, where nobody humiliates you, and where nobody kills you.": 1,
    " Well I think that should be the minimum.": 1,
    " How about a place of healing, of learning, and even opportunity?": 1,
    " Americans and Europeans have the impression that proportionally huge numbers of refugees are coming to their country.": 1,
    " But the reality is that 86%, the vast majority of refugees, are living in the developing world, in countries struggling with their own insecurity.": 1,
    " with their own issues of helping their own populations in poverty.": 1,
    " So wealthy countries in the world should recognize the humanity and the generosity of the countries that are hosting so many refugees.": 1,
    " in all countries should make sure that no one fleeing war and persecution arrives at a closed border.": 1,
    " But there is something more that we can do than just simply helping refugees survive.": 1,
    "We can help them thrive.": 1,
    " We should think of refugee camps and communities as more than just temporary population centers where people languish waiting for the war to end.": 1,
    " rather as centers of excellence.": 1,
    " where refugees can triumph over their trauma and train for the day that they can go home as agents of positive change and social transformation.": 1,
    " It makes so much sense.": 1,
    "But I'm reminded of the terrible war in Somalia that has been raging on for 22 years.": 1,
    "And imagine living in this camp.": 1,
    " I visited this camp, it's in Djibouti, neighboring Somalia, and it was so remote that we had to take a helicopter to fly there.": 1,
    "It was dusty and it was terribly hot.": 1,
    " And we went to visit a school and started talking to the children.": 1,
    "And then I saw this girl across the room who looked to me to be the same age as my own daughter.": 1,
    "And I went up and talked to her.": 1,
    " And I asked her the questions that grown-ups ask kids, like, what is your favorite subject?": 1,
    "And what do you want to be when you grow up?": 1,
    "And this is when her face turned blank.": 1,
    "And she said to me,": 1,
    " I have no future.": 1,
    "My schooling days are over.": 1,
    "And I thought there must be some misunderstanding.": 1,
    "So I turned to my colleague and she confirmed to me there is no funding for secondary education in this camp.": 1,
    " and how I wished at that moment that I could say to her, we will build you a school.": 1,
    " And I also thought, what a waste.": 1,
    "She should be and she is the future of Somalia.": 1,
    " A boy named Jacob Atame had a different chance, but not before he experienced terrible tragedy.": 1,
    " He watched, this is in Sudan, as his village, he was only seven years old, burned to the ground and he learned that his mother and his father and his entire family": 1,
    " were killed that day.": 1,
    "Only his cousin survived and the two of them walked for seven months.": 1,
    "This is boys like him.": 1,
    " chased and pursued by wild animals and armed gangs, and they finally made it to refugee camps where they found safety.": 1,
    "And he would spend the next seven years in Kenya in a refugee camp.": 1,
    " But his life changed when he got the chance to be resettled to the United States.": 1,
    "And he found love in a foster family, and he was able to go to school.": 1,
    " And he wanted me to share with you this proud moment when he graduated from university.": 1,
    " I spoke to him on Skype the other day and he was in his new university in Florida.": 1,
    " pursuing his PhD in public health.": 1,
    "And he proudly told me how he was able to raise enough funds from the American public to establish a health clinic back in his village, back home.": 1,
    " So I want to take you back to Hanny.": 1,
    "When I told him I was going to have the chance to speak to you here on the TED stage, he allowed me to read you a poem that he sent in an email to me.": 1,
    " He wrote,": 1,
    " I miss myself, my friends.": 1,
    " times of reading novels or writing poems.": 1,
    " birds and tea in the morning.": 1,
    " My room, my books, myself.": 1,
    " and everything that was making me smile.": 1,
    " Oh, oh, I had so many dreams that were about to be realized.": 1,
    " So here is my point.": 1,
    "Not investing in refugees is a huge missed opportunity.": 1,
    " leave them abandoned, and they risk exploitation and abuse, and leave them unskilled and uneducated,": 1,
    " and delay by years the return to peace and prosperity in their countries.": 1,
    " I believe how we treat the uprooted will shape the future of our world.": 1,
    " The victims of war can hold the keys to lasting peace, and it's the refugees who can stop the cycle of violence.": 1,
    "Hani is at a tipping point.": 1,
    " We would love to help him go to university and to become an engineer.": 1,
    " But our funds are prioritized for the basics in life.": 1,
    "Tents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets, food rations and a bit of medicine.": 1,
    " University is a luxury.": 1,
    " but leave him to languish in this muddy field, and he will become a member of a lost generation.": 1,
    " Hanny's story is a tragedy.": 1,
    " but it doesn't have to end that way.": 1
