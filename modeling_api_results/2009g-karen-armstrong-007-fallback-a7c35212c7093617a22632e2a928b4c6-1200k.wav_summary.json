    " For years, I've been feeling frustrated because as a religious historian, I've become acutely aware of the centrality of compassion in all the major world faiths.": 1,
    " Every single one of them has evolved their own version of what's been called the Golden Rule.": 1,
    " Sometimes it comes in a positive version.": 1,
    "Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself.": 1,
    "And equally important is the negative version.": 1,
    "Don't do to others.": 1,
    " what you would not like them to do to you.": 1,
    " Look into your own heart, discover what it is that gives you pain, and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever, to inflict that pain on anybody else.": 1,
    " And people have emphasized the importance of compassion, not just because it sounds good, but because it works.": 1,
    " People have found that when they have implemented the golden rule, as Confucius said, all day and every day, not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then": 1,
    " returning to a life of greed and egotism.": 1,
    "But to do it all day and every day, you dethrone yourself from the center of your world, put another there, and you transcend yourself.": 1,
    " And it brings you into the presence of what's being called God, nirvana, ramen, thou, something that goes beyond.": 1,
    " what we know in our ego-bound existence.": 1,
    "But you know, you'd never know it a lot of the time that this was so central to the religious life, because with a few wonderful exceptions,": 1,
    " Very often when religious people come together, religious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines or uttering counsel of hatred.": 1,
    " or in being against homosexuality or something of that sort.": 1,
    "Often people don't really want to be compassionate.": 1,
    " I sometimes see when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead.": 1,
    " And that of course defeats the object of the exercise.": 1,
    "Now why was I so grateful to Ted?": 1,
    "Because...": 1,
    " because they took me very gently from my book-line study and brought me into the 21st century, enabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience than I could have ever conceived.": 1,
    " because I feel an urgency about this.": 1,
    "If we don't manage to implement the golden rule globally,": 1,
    " so that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be, as though they were as important as ourselves.": 1,
    "I doubt that we'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation.": 1,
    "The task of our time": 1,
    " One of the great tasks of our time is to build a global society, as I said, that where people can live together in peace and the religions that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem.": 1,
    " And of course, it's not just religious people who believe in the golden rule.": 1,
    "This is the source of all morality, this imaginative act of empathy, putting yourself in the place of another.": 1,
    " And so we have a choice, it seems to me.": 1,
    " we can either go on bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith, or we can": 1,
    " go back to the rabbis, Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus who when asked by a pagan to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg,": 1,
    " said, that which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.": 1,
    "That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary.": 1,
    " and the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate.": 1,
    " We need to revive that spirit and it's not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down.": 1,
    "We have to make this happen and we can do it with the modern communications that Ted": 1,
    " has introduced.": 1,
    "Already, I've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners.": 1,
    " In Singapore, a group are going to use the charter to heal divisions recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society.": 1,
    " and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically.": 1,
    " In Malaysia, there's going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to be taking young people and showing them": 1,
    " that compassion also lies at the root of all art.": 1,
    "Throughout Europe, the Muslim communities are holding events and discussions discussing the centrality of compassion.": 1,
    " in Islam and in all faiths.": 1,
    " But it can't stop there, it can't stop with the launch.": 1,
    "Religious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong, concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines.": 1,
    "Religious teaching must always lead to action.": 1,
    " And I intend to work on this till my dying day.": 1,
    "And I want to continue with our partners.": 1,
    " to do two things, educate and stimulate compassionate thinking.": 1,
    " Education, because people, we've so dropped out of compassion, people often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody.": 1,
    "But of course you don't understand compassion.": 1,
    " If you're just going to think about it, you also have to do it.": 1,
    "I want them to get the media involved because the media are crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people.": 1,
    " which are dividing us from one another.": 1,
    "The same applies to educators.": 1,
    "I'd like youth to get a sense of the dynamism, the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate lifestyle.": 1,
    " and also see that it demands acute intelligence, not just a gooey feeling.": 1,
    " I'd like to call upon scholars to explore the compassionate theme in their own and in other people's traditions.": 1,
    "And perhaps above all,": 1,
    " to encourage a sensitivity about uncompassionate speaking, so that because people have this charter, whatever their beliefs or lack of them,": 1,
    " They feel empowered to challenge uncompassionate speech, disdainful remarks from their religious leaders, their political leaders,": 1,
    " from the captains of industry.": 1,
    "Because we can change the world.": 1,
    "We have the ability.": 1,
    "I would never have thought of putting the charter online.": 1,
    "I was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room.": 1,
    " and issuing yet another arcane statement.": 1,
    " And Ted introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas, because that's what is so wonderful about Ted.": 1,
    "In this room, all this expertise, if we joined it all together.": 1,
    " we can change the world.": 1,
    "And of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable.": 1,
    "But I'd just like to finish at the end with a reference to a British author, an Oxford author, whom I don't": 1,
    " speak a quote very often, C.S.": 1,
    "Lewis.": 1,
    "But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since I read it when I was a school girl.": 1,
    "It's in his book, The Four Loves.": 1,
    " He said that he distinguished between erotic love when two people gaze spellbound into each other's eyes.": 1,
    "And then he compared that to friendship.": 1,
    " when two people stand side by side as it were shoulder to shoulder with their eyes fixed on a common goal.": 1,
    "We don't have to fall in love with each other, but we can become friends.": 1,
    " I am convinced.": 1,
    "I felt it very strongly during our deliberations at Vevey.": 1,
    " that when people of all different persuasions come together, working side by side for a common goal, differences meld away and we learn amity.": 1,
    " and we learn to live together and to get to know one another.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
