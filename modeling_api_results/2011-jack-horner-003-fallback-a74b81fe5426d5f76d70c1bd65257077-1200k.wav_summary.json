    " when I was growing up in Montana.": 1,
    " I had two dreams.": 1,
    "I wanted to be a paleontologist, a dinosaur paleontologist, and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur.": 1,
    " That's what I've been striving for all of my life.": 1,
    " I was very fortunate early in my career.": 1,
    " I was fortunate in finding things.": 1,
    "I wasn't very good at reading things.": 1,
    "In fact, I don't read much of anything.": 1,
    "I am extremely dyslexic, and so reading is the hardest thing I do.": 1,
    " But instead, I go out and I find things.": 1,
    "I just pick things up.": 1,
    "I basically practice for finding money on the street.": 1,
    " And I wander about the hills and I have found a few things.": 1,
    " I have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the Western Hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests.": 1,
    " the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones and": 1,
    " It happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles of": 1,
    " that people had thought for so many years and people were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special.": 1,
    "And so at that time I was able to make some": 1,
    " interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues.": 1,
    "We were able to actually say that dinosaurs, based on the evidence we had, that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies.": 1,
    " and cared for their young, brought food to their babies, and traveled in gigantic herds.": 1,
    " So it was pretty interesting stuff.": 1,
    "I have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social.": 1,
    "We have found": 1,
    " a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults.": 1,
    "The appearance of them would have been different.": 1,
    " which it is in all social animals.": 1,
    "In social groups of animals, the juveniles always look different than the adults.": 1,
    "The adults can recognize the juveniles, the juveniles can recognize the adults.": 1,
    " And so we're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looked like, and they didn't just all chase jeeps around.": 1,
    " But it is that social thing that I guess attracted": 1,
    " Michael Crichton in his book he talked about the social animals and then Steven Spielberg of course depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures.": 1,
    " The theme of this story is building a dinosaur, and so we come to that part of Jurassic Park.": 1,
    "Michael Crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.": 1,
    " You all know this story, right?": 1,
    "I mean, I assume everyone here has seen Jurassic Park.": 1,
    "If you want to make a dinosaur, you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap.": 1,
    " otherwise known as amber, that has some blood-sucking insects in it.": 1,
    "Good ones.": 1,
    " You get your insect, you drill into it, and you suck out some DNA, because obviously all insects that suck blood in those days suck dinosaur DNA out.": 1,
    " and you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it and I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg or something like that and then you wait and lo and behold out pops the little baby dinosaur.": 1,
    " And everybody's happy about that.": 1,
    " And they're happy over and over again.": 1,
    "They keep doing it.": 1,
    "They just keep making these things.": 1,
    "And then they, then, then, and then, you know, then.": 1,
    " the dinosaurs being social, act out their socialness and they get together and they conspire.": 1,
    " And of course that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie, conspiring dinosaurs, chasing people around.": 1,
    "Now I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it and you drilled into it and you": 1,
    " got something out of that insect and you cloned it and you did it over and over and over again, you'd have a room full of mosquitoes.": 1,
    "Right?": 1,
    " Four maybes.": 1,
    " And probably a whole bunch of trees as well.": 1,
    " If you want dinosaur DNA, I say go to the dinosaur.": 1,
    " So that's what we've done.": 1,
    "Back in 1993, when the movie came out, we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur.": 1,
    "And we chose the dinosaur on the left, a Tyrannosaurus Rex,": 1,
    " which was a very nice specimen.": 1,
    "And one of my former doctoral students, Dr. Mary Schweitzer, actually had the background to do this sort of thing.": 1,
    " She looked into the bone of this T-Rex, one of the thigh bones, and she actually found some very interesting structures in there.": 1,
    " They found these red circular looking objects and they looked for all the world like red blood cells.": 1,
    " And they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone.": 1,
    "And so, she thought, well, what the heck?": 1,
    " sampled some material out of it.": 1,
    "And it wasn't DNA.": 1,
    "She didn't find DNA.": 1,
    "But she did find heme, which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin.": 1,
    "And that was really cool.": 1,
    " But that was interesting.": 1,
    "And that was here we have sixty five million year old.": 1,
    " him.": 1,
    " Well, we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it, so a few years went by and then we started the Hell Creek Project.": 1,
    "The Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking to get": 1,
    " as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them.": 1,
    "And out in eastern Montana,": 1,
    " There's a lot of space, a lot of badlands, and not very many people, and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff.": 1,
    "And we did find a lot of stuff.": 1,
    "We found a lot of tyrannosaurs, but we found one special tyrannosaur, and we called it B. rex.": 1,
    " And B-Rex was found under a thousand cubic yards of rock.": 1,
    "It wasn't a very complete T-Rex, and it wasn't a very big T-Rex.": 1,
    " but it was a very special B-Rex.": 1,
    "I and my colleagues cut into it and we were able to determine by looking at lines of arrested growth, some lines in it that B-Rex had died at the age of 16.": 1,
    " We don't really know how long dinosaurs live because we haven't found the oldest one yet.": 1,
    " but this one died at the age of 16.": 1,
    "We gave samples to Mary Schweitzer and she was actually able to determine that B. rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone.": 1,
    " Medullary tissue is the calcium buildup, the calcium storage basically, when an animal is pregnant, when a bird is pregnant.": 1,
    "So here was a character that linked birds and dinosaurs.": 1,
    " But Mary went further.": 1,
    "She took the bone and she dumped it into acid.": 1,
    "Now, we all know that bones are fossilized.": 1,
    "And so if you dump it into acid, there shouldn't be anything left.": 1,
    " But there was something left.": 1,
    "There were blood vessels left.": 1,
    "There were flexible, clear blood vessels.": 1,
    " And so here was the first soft tissues from a dinosaur.": 1,
    "It was extraordinary.": 1,
    "But she also found osteocytes, which are the cells that laid down the bones.": 1,
    " And try and try, we could not find DNA, but she did find evidence of proteins.": 1,
    "But we thought maybe, well...": 1,
    " We thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground.": 1,
    "We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.": 1,
    "And so we built a laboratory in the back of an 18-wheeler trailer.": 1,
    "It actually took the laboratory to the field.": 1,
    " where we could get better samples.": 1,
    "And we did.": 1,
    "We got better material.": 1,
    "The cells looked better.": 1,
    "The vessels looked better.": 1,
    " found the protein collagen.": 1,
    "I mean, it was wonderful stuff, but it's not dinosaur DNA.": 1,
    " So we have discovered that dinosaur DNA and all DNA just breaks down too fast.": 1,
    "We're just not going to be able to do what they did in Jurassic Park.": 1,
    "We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur": 1,
    " based on a dinosaur.": 1,
    " But...": 1,
    " Birds are dinosaurs.": 1,
    "Birds are living dinosaurs.": 1,
    " We actually classify them as dinosaurs.": 1,
    "We now call them non-avian dinosaurs and avian dinosaurs.": 1,
    "So the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct.": 1,
    " Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds, so we don't have to make a dinosaur.": 1,
    "We already have them.": 1,
    " I know, you're as bad as the sixth graders, right?": 1,
    " The sixth graders look at it and they say, no.": 1,
    " You can call it you can call it a dinosaur, but look at the velociraptor.": 1,
    "The velociraptor is cool.": 1,
    " The chicken is not.": 1,
    " So this is our problem, as you can imagine.": 1,
    " The chicken is a dinosaur.": 1,
    "I mean, it really is.": 1,
    "I mean, you can't argue with it because we, you know, we're the classifiers and we classified it that way.": 1,
    " but the sixth graders demand it.": 1,
    "Fix the chicken.": 1,
    " So that's what I'm here to tell you about, how we're going to fix a chicken.": 1,
    " So, we have a number of ways that we actually can.": 1,
    " fix the chicken.": 1,
    "Because evolution works, we actually have some evolutionary tools.": 1,
    " We'll call them biological modification tools.": 1,
    "We have selection.": 1,
    "And we know selection works, right?": 1,
    "I mean, we started out with a wolf-like creature, and we end up with a Maltese.": 1,
    " I mean that's...": 1,
    " That's definitely genetic modification.": 1,
    " or any of the other funny looking little dogs.": 1,
    " We also have transgenesis.": 1,
    "Transgenesis is really cool too.": 1,
    "That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one.": 1,
    "That's how we, you know, that's how people made glow fish.": 1,
    "You take a gene, a glow gene out of a, out of a,": 1,
    " coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish and they glow.": 1,
    "And you know, that's pretty cool.": 1,
    "And they obviously make a lot of money off of them.": 1,
    " And now they're making glow rabbits and glow all sorts of things.": 1,
    "I guess we could make a glow chicken.": 1,
    " But I don't think that'll satisfy the sixth graders either.": 1,
    " But there's another thing, and there's what we call atavism activation.": 1,
    "And atavism activation is basically": 1,
    " An atavism is an ancestral characteristic.": 1,
    "You've heard that occasionally children are born with tails, and it's because it's an ancestral characteristic.": 1,
    " And so there are a number of atavisms that can happen.": 1,
    "Snakes are occasionally born with legs.": 1,
    "And here's an example.": 1,
    "This is a chicken with teeth.": 1,
    " A fellow by the name of Matthew Harris at the University of Wisconsin in Madison actually figured out a way to stimulate the gene.": 1,
    " of teeth for teeth, and so was able to actually turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth in, in chickens.": 1,
    " Now that's a good characteristic.": 1,
    "We can save that one.": 1,
    "We know we can use that.": 1,
    "We can make a chicken with teeth.": 1,
    " That's getting closer.": 1,
    "That's better than a glowing chicken.": 1,
    " A friend of mine, a colleague of mine, Dr. Hans Larsen at McGill University is actually looking at otterisms and he's looking at them by looking at the": 1,
    " the embryogenesis of birds and actually looking at how they develop.": 1,
    "And he's interested in how birds actually lost their tail.": 1,
    "He's also interested in the transformation of the arm, the hand, to the wing.": 1,
    " He's looking for those genes as well.": 1,
    "And I said, well, you know, if you can find those, I can just reverse them and make what I need to make for the sixth graders.": 1,
    "And so he agreed.": 1,
    " That's what we're looking into.": 1,
    "If you look at dinosaur hands, Velociraptor has that cool looking hand with the claws on it.": 1,
    " Archaeopteryx, which is a bird, a primitive bird, still has that very primitive hand, but as you can see the pigeon or a chicken or anything else, like a bird, has kind of a weird looking hand because the hand is a wing.": 1,
    " But the cool thing is, is that if you look in the embryo, as the embryo is developing, the hand actually": 1,
    " looks pretty much like the Archaeopteryx hand.": 1,
    "It has the three fingers, the three digits.": 1,
    "But a gene turns on that actually fuses those together.": 1,
    " And so what we're looking for is that gene.": 1,
    "We want to stop that gene from turning on, fusing those hands together, so we can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand, like the Archaeopteryx.": 1,
    "And the same goes for the tails.": 1,
    " Birds have basically rudimentary tails.": 1,
    " And so we know that in embryo, as the animal is developing, it actually has a relatively long tail.": 1,
    " But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it.": 1,
    "So that's the other gene we're looking for.": 1,
    "We want to stop that tail from resorbing.": 1,
    " So what we're trying to do really is take our chicken.": 1,
    " modify it, and make a chickenasaurus.": 1,
    " It's a cooler looking chicken.": 1,
    "I mean, but it's just the very basics.": 1,
    "So that really is what we're doing.": 1,
    "And people always say, well, you know, why do that?": 1,
    "Why make this thing?": 1,
    "What good is it?": 1,
    " Well, that's a good question, you know.": 1,
    "Actually, I think it's a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and developmental biology and all sorts of things.": 1,
    "And quite frankly, I think if, if\u2026": 1,
    " Colonel Sanders was to be careful how he worded it.": 1,
    "He could actually advertise an extra piece.": 1,
    " Anyway.": 1,
    " when our dino chicken hatches.": 1,
    " It will be obviously the poster child or what you might call a poster check for technology, entertainment, and design.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
