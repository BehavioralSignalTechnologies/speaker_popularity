    " This was a situation that traditional aid agencies had never before encountered.": 1,
    "We were in one of the poorest countries on the planet, but 80% of the people had mobile devices in their hands.": 1,
    " And we were unprepared for this, and they were shaping the aid effort.": 1,
    " Outside Haiti, also, things were looking different.": 1,
    "Tens of thousands of so-called digital volunteers were scouring the internet, converting tweets that had already been converted from texts": 1,
    " and putting these into open source maps, layering them with all sorts of important information, people like crisis mappers and open street map, and putting these on the web for everybody, the media, the aid organizations, and the communities themselves.": 1,
    " to participate in and to use.": 1,

    "We wanted it to be easy to use.": 1,
    " Out of this rubble of Haiti and from this devastation came something that we call TERA, the Trilogy Emergency Response Application, which has been used to support the aid effort ever since.": 1,
    " It has been used to help communities prepare for disasters.": 1,
    "It is used to signal early warning in advance of weather related disasters.": 1,

    " and it's even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender-based violence.": 1,
