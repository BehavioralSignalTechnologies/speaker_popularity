    " I'm the weekly tech critic for the New York Times, so I review gadgets and stuff, and mostly what Good Dad should be doing this time of year": 1,
    " is nestling with their kids and decorating the Christmas tree.": 1,
    "What I'm mostly doing this year is going on cable TV and answering the same question, what are the tech trends for next year?": 1,
    " And I'm like, didn't you just go through this last year?": 1,
    "But I'm going to pick the one that interests me most, and that is the completed marriage of the cell phone and the internet.": 1,
    " You know, I found that volcano on Google images not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of Dianetics.": 1,
    " Anyway, this all started a few years ago when they started carrying your voice over the internet rather than over a phone line.": 1,
    "And we've come a long way since that.": 1,
    "But that was interesting in itself.": 1,
    "This is companies like Vonage.": 1,
    " Basically, you take an ordinary telephone, you plug it into this little box that they give you, and the box plugs into your cable modem.": 1,
    "Now it works just like a regular phone.": 1,
    "So you can pick up the phone.": 1,
    "You hear a dial tone.": 1,
    " But it's just a fake out.": 1,
    "It's a wave file of a dial tone.": 1,
    "And just to reassure you that the world hasn't ended.": 1,
    "And it could be anything.": 1,
    "It could be salsa music or a comedy routine.": 1,
    "It doesn't matter.": 1,
    " So the little box has your phone number, so that's really cool.": 1,
    "You can take it to London or Siberia and your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring because it's got everything in the box.": 1,
    "They've got every feature known to man in there.": 1,
    " Because adding a new feature is just software.": 1,
    "And as a result of voice over IP, I hate that term, voice over internet, landline home phone service has gone down 30%.": 1,
    " in the last three years.": 1,
    "I mean, no self-respecting college kid has home phone service anymore.": 1,
    "This is what college kids are more likely to have.": 1,
    "It's the most popular VoIP service in the world.": 1,
    "It's Skype.": 1,
    "It's a free program you download for your Mac or PC, and you make free phone calls anywhere in the world.": 1,
    " The downside is that you have to wear a headset, like a nerd.": 1,
    "It's not your phone, it's your computer.": 1,
    "But nonetheless, if you're a college kid and you have no money,": 1,
    " Believe me, this is better than trying to use your cell phone.": 1,
    "It's really cute seeing middle-aged people like me try out Skype for the first time, which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad.": 1,
    "You know, they don't want to pay the international fees.": 1,
    "They're like...": 1,
    " Timmy, is that you?": 1,
    "It's really cute.": 1,
    " But at least it was when I did it.": 1,
    "So I think where VoIP is really going to get interesting is when they start putting it on cell phones.": 1,
    "Imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone, and any time you're within a wireless hotspot,": 1,
    " Free calls anywhere in the world never pay the cellular company a nickel.": 1,
    "It would be really, really cool.": 1,
    "And yet, even though the technology for this has been available,": 1,
    " for five years, incredibly the number of standard cell phones offered by U.S.": 1,
    "carriers with free VoIP is zero!": 1,
    "I can't figure out why!": 1,
    " Actually, I need to update that.": 1,
    "There's one now.": 1,
    "And it's so interesting that I thought I would tell you about it.": 1,
    "It comes from T-Mobile.": 1,
    "And I am not paid by T-Mobile.": 1,
    "I'm not plugging T-Mobile.": 1,
    "The New York Times has very rigid policies about that.": 1,
    " Ever since that Jason Blair jerk ruined it for all of us.": 1,
    "Basically, the reason you haven't heard about this program is because it was introduced last year on June 29.": 1,
    "Does anyone remember what else happened on June 29 last year?": 1,
    " It was the iPhone.": 1,
    "The iPhone came out that day.": 1,
    "And I'm like, can you imagine being the T-Mobile PR lady?": 1,
    "Hi, we have an announcement to... But...": 1,
    " But it's actually really, really cool.": 1,
    "So you have a choice of phones.": 1,
    "And we're not talking smartphones, ordinary phones, including a BlackBerry, that have Wi-Fi.": 1,
    "And the deal is, any time you're in a Wi-Fi hotspot, all your calls are free.": 1,
    " And when you're out of the hot spot, you're on the regular cellular network.": 1,
    "And you're thinking, well, how often am I in a hot spot?": 1,
    "And the answer is all the time, because they give you": 1,
    " a regular wireless router that works with the phone for your house, which is really ingenious because we all know that T-Mobile is the most pathetic carrier.": 1,
    "They have coverage the size of my thumbnail.": 1,
    " But it's $100 million to put up one of those towers, right?": 1,
    "They don't have that kind of money.": 1,
    "Instead, they give each of us a $7.95 box, and they're like a stealth tower installation program.": 1,
    "They're like, we're putting it in our homes for them.": 1,
    " Anyway, they have Wi-Fi phones in Europe, but the thing that T-Mobile did that nobody's done before is when you're on a call and you move from Wi-Fi into cellular range, the call is handed off in mid-syllable.": 1,
    " seamlessly.": 1,
    "And I'll show you the advanced technologies we use at the New York Times to test this gear.": 1,
    "This is me with a camcorder on a phone going like this.": 1,
    " as I walk out of the house from my WiFi hotspot into the cellular network on a call with my wife.": 1,
    "And look at the upper left.": 1,
    "That's the WiFi signal.": 1,
    " Hi babes, it's me.": 1,
    "Oh, hi darling, how are you?": 1,
    "You're on Wi-Fi, how does it sound?": 1,
    " I'm going for a walk, do you mind?": 1,
    " I'm having a great day with the kids.": 1,
    "What are you guys doing?": 1,
    "Right there.": 1,
    " It just changed to the cellular tower in mid-call.": 1,
    "I don't know why my wife says I never listen to her.": 1,
    "I don't get that.": 1,
    " The bottom line is that the boundaries because of the internet plus cell phone are melting.": 1,
    "The cool thing about the T-Mobile phones is that although switching technology is very advanced, the billing technology has not caught up.": 1,
    " So what I mean is you can start a call in your house on the Wi-Fi hotspot, you can get in your car and talk to the battery's dead, which would be like 10 minutes, and the call will continue to be free.": 1,
    " because they don't, they haven't, well no wait, not so fast.": 1,
    "It also works the other way.": 1,
    " So if you start a call on the cellular network and you come home, you keep being billed, which is why most people with this service get into the habit of saying, hey, I just got home.": 1,
    "Can I call you right back?": 1,
    " Now you get it.": 1,
    "But anyway, and it's also true that if you use one of these phones overseas, it doesn't know what internet hot spot you're in.": 1,
    "On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog.": 1,
    "Nobody knows you're in": 1,
    " Pakistan so you can make free unlimited calls home to the U.S.": 1,
    "with these phones.": 1,
    "So very, very interesting.": 1,
    "This is another favorite of mine.": 1,
    "Does anyone here have a": 1,
    " working cell phone that's on with coverage who can make a call right now without a lot of fussing.": 1,
    "Okay, would you call me please right now?": 1,
    " And don't you all call me at 3 a.m.": 1,
    "asking me to fix your printer.": 1,
    "So I have two cell phones, so this is going to be very odd if it works.": 1,
    "I should know not to do technology demos in front of an audience.": 1,
    "It's like absurd.": 1,
    " So this one's going off, and oh, I have the ringer off.": 1,
    "Great.": 1,
    "Anyway, this one's also going off.": 1,
    "So they're both ringing at the same time.": 1,
    "Excuse me one second.": 1,
    " Hello.": 1,
    " Oh, where are you calling from?": 1,
    "No, no, just kidding.": 1,
    "Thank you very much for doing that.": 1,
    "I didn't even know it was you.": 1,
    "I was looking at this guy.": 1,
    "Oh, great, yeah.": 1,
    "You can all stop calling now.": 1,
    " Alright!": 1,
    " We've made the point.": 1,
    "All right.": 1,
    "Bring her off.": 1,
    " Everyone wants in on the action.": 1,
    "So this is Grand Central at work.": 1,
    "Oh, for God's sake.": 1,
    " I have your numbers now.": 1,
    " You will pay!": 1,
    " Grand Central is this really brilliant idea where they give you a new phone number and then at that point one phone number rings all your phones at once.": 1,
    "Your home phone, your work phone, your cell phone, your yacht phone.": 1,
    "This is the EG crowd.": 1,
    " And the beauty of that is you never miss a call.": 1,
    "And I know a lot of you are like, you know, who would want to be reaching any hour?": 1,
    "But the beauty is it's all going through the internet, so you have all these really cool features like": 1,
    " you can say, I want these people to be able to call me only during these hours, and I want these people to hear this greeting, you know, hi boss, I'm out making us both some money, leave a message, you know, and then your wife calls and hi honey, leave me a message, you know, so.": 1,
    " Very, very customizable.": 1,
    " Google bought it, and they've been working on it for a year.": 1,
    "They're supposed to come out with it very shortly in the public method.": 1,
    "By the way, this is something that really bothers me.": 1,
    "I don't know if you realize this, when you call 411 on your cell phone,": 1,
    " They charge you two bucks.": 1,
    "Did you know that?": 1,
    "It's an outrage.": 1,
    "And I actually got a photograph of the Verizon employee right there.": 1,
    "And I'm going to tell you how to avoid that now.": 1,
    "What you're going to use is Google Cellular.": 1,
    "It's totally free.": 1,
    "There's not even ads.": 1,
    " If you know how to send a text message, you can get the same information for free.": 1,
    "I'm about to change your life.": 1,
    "So here's me doing it.": 1,
    "You send a text message to the word Google, which turns out to be 46645.": 1,
    "Leave off the last E for savings.": 1,
    " Anyway, so let's say you need a drug store in Chicago, you type Pharmacy Chicago or the zip code, you hit send and in five seconds, they will send you back the two closest drug stores, complete with name, address, and phone number.": 1,
    "Here it comes.": 1,
    " And it's already written down.": 1,
    "So like if you're driving, you don't have to do one of these things.": 1,
    "Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.": 1,
    "Or it works with weather, too.": 1,
    "You can say weather in the name of the city where you're going to travel to.": 1,
    "And then in five seconds, they send you back the complete weather forecast for that town.": 1,
    " And shortly I'll tell you why I was in Milan.": 1,
    "There we go.": 1,
    "And those are just the beginning.": 1,
    "These are all the different things that you can text to Google and they will, yeah, you're all trying to write this down.": 1,
    "That's cute.": 1,
    " I do have an email address, you can just ask me.": 1,
    "It's absolutely phenomenal.": 1,
    "The only downside is that it requires you to know how to text.": 1,
    " send a text message, but nobody over 40 knows how to do that.": 1,
    "So I'm going to teach you something even better.": 1,
    "This is called Google info.": 1,
    "They've just launched this voice-activated version of the same thing, and it's speech recognition like you've never heard before.": 1,
    "So let's say I'm in Monterey.": 1,
    " And I want what?": 1,
    "I want to find what?": 1,
    " Bagels.": 1,
    " Bagels, Monterey, California.": 1,
    " I got the Chinese line.": 1,
    " California top eight results number one big bakery on Alvarado Street to select number one you can press one or say number one": 1,
    " number two bagel bakery commissary department number two": 1,
    " Number 2. 2.": 1,
    " Why do I listen to people in the audience?": 1,
    " Well, anyway.": 1,
    "Oh, here we go.": 1,
    "He's connecting me.": 1,
    "He doesn't even tell me the phone number.": 1,
    "He's just connecting me directly.": 1,
    "It's like having a personal valet on call.": 1,
    " Could I have 400 with a schmear?": 1,
    "No, no, no, just kidding.": 1,
    "So anyway...": 1,
    " You never even find out the number.": 1,
    "It's just so amazing.": 1,
    "And it's incredible, incredible accuracy.": 1,
    "This is even more amazing.": 1,
    "Put this in your speed dial.": 1,
    "This you can ask by voice any question.": 1,
    " Who won the 1958 World Series?": 1,
    "What's the recipe for a certain cocktail?": 1,
    "It's absolutely amazing, and they text you back the answer.": 1,
    "I tried this this morning just to make sure it's still alive.": 1,
    "Which actors have played James Bond?": 1,
    "They text me back this.": 1,
    "Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, James Dalton, Pierce President, Daniel Craig.": 1,
    " Right.": 1,
    "And then I was trying to pretend I was like a valley girl.": 1,
    "I'm like, what's the word that means, you know, like when the sun, the moon, and the earth are like all in a line?": 1,
    "Just to see how the recognition was.": 1,
    "They texted me back.": 1,
    "It's called a syzygy.": 1,
    " which I knew because it's the word that won me the Ohio spelling bee in 1976.": 1,
    "You know, there's a lot of people wondering how on earth are they gonna make money doing this, and the answer is, look at the last line, they put this teeny weeny little ad about 10 characters long,": 1,
    " And a lot of people also want to know, how does it work?": 1,
    "How can it be so good?": 1,
    "It's almost as though there's a human being on the other end of the line.": 1,
    "Because there is one!": 1,
    " They have 10,000 people who are being paid 20 cents per answer.": 1,
    "As you can imagine, it's college kids and old people.": 1,
    " That's who can afford to do that, but it's a human being on the line, and it's gotten me out of so many tough positions.": 1,
    "Like, when's the last flight out of Chicago?": 1,
    "It's just absolutely amazing.": 1,
    " Another thing that really bothers me about cell phones today, this is probably my biggest pet peeve in all of technology, when I call to leave you a message, I get 15 seconds of instructions": 1,
    " from a third grade teacher on Ambien.": 1,
    " to page this person.": 1,
    "Page?": 1,
    "What is it, 1975?": 1,
    " Nobody has pagers anymore.": 1,
    "You may begin speaking at the tone.": 1,
    "When you have finished recording, you may hang up.": 1,
    "No!": 1,
    " And then it gets worse.": 1,
    "When I called to retrieve my messages, first of all, you have 87 messages.": 1,
    "To listen to your messages, why else am I calling?": 1,
    " Of course I want to listen to the messages!": 1,
    " Oh, you all have cell phones too.": 1,
    "So last year I went to Milan, Italy and I got to speak to an audience of cellular executives from 200 countries around the world.": 1,
    " And I said as a joke, as a joke, I said I did the math.": 1,
    "Verizon has 70 million customers.": 1,
    "If you check your voicemail twice a day.": 1,
    " That's a hundred million dollars a year.": 1,
    "I bet you guys are doing this just to run up our airtime, aren't you?": 1,
    "No chuckle, they're like this.": 1,
    " Where's the outrage, people?": 1,
    "Rise up!": 1,
    " Sorry, I'm not bitter.": 1,
    " So now I'm going to tell you how to get out of that.": 1,
    "There are these services that transcribe your voicemail into text.": 1,
    "And they send it either to your email or as text messages to your phone.": 1,
    "It is a life changer.": 1,
    "And by the way,": 1,
    " They don't always get the words right because it's over the phone and all that.": 1,
    "So they attach the audio file at the bottom of the email so you can listen to double check.": 1,
    "The services are called things like SpinVox, PhoneTag.": 1,
    " And a lot of people say, how are they doing this?": 1,
    "I don't really want people listening into my calls.": 1,
    "And the executives of these companies told me, well, we use a proprietary, B2B, best of breed, peer-to-peer solution.": 1,
    " I think basically it's like these guys in India with headsets listening in.": 1,
    "And the reason I think that is that on the first day I tried one of these services, I got two voicemail messages.": 1,
    "One was from a guy named Michael Stevenson, which shouldn't be that hard.": 1,
    " to transcribe and it was misspelled.": 1,
    "And the other was for my video producer at the times whose name is Vijay Singh with a silent H. Nailed that one.": 1,
    " So.": 1,
    " You be the judge.": 1,
    " Anyway, this service, CallWave, promises that it's all software.": 1,
    "Nobody's listening to your messages.": 1,
    "And they also promise that they're going to transcribe only the gist of your messages.": 1,
    " So I thought I'd see how that goes.": 1,
    "This is me testing it out.": 1,
    "Hello, this is Michael.": 1,
    "I hope you're doing well.": 1,
    "I'm fine here.": 1,
    "Everything's good.": 1,
    " Hey, um, I was walking along the street and the sky was blue and your daughter broke her leg at soccer practice.": 1,
    " I'm going to have a sandwich for lunch.": 1,
    "She's in room, emergency room 53W.": 1,
    " Okay, talk to you later, bye.": 1,
    " Okay, so...": 1,
    " I love my job.": 1,
    " So a couple of minutes later, this I got by email.": 1,
    "It's a very good transcription.": 1,
    "But a couple of minutes after that, I got the text message version.": 1,
    "Now remember, a text message can only be 160 characters long.": 1,
    "So it had better be.": 1,
    " the gist of the gist, right?": 1,
    "And I'm not kidding you, the message said, was walking along the street and sky was blue and emergency.": 1,
    " Well, I guess that was the gist, you know.": 1,
    " And lastly, I just have to talk about this one.": 1,
    "This is my favorite of all time.": 1,
    "It's called popularitydialer.com.": 1,
    "And basically, you're going to go on some iffy date.": 1,
    " or a potentially bad meeting, right?": 1,
    "So you go and you type in your phone number and at the exact minute where you want to be called.": 1,
    " And at that moment, your phone will ring, and you're like, I'm sorry, I got to take this, right?": 1,
    "And the really beautiful thing is, you know how when somebody's sitting next to you, sometimes they can hear you a little bit of the caller?": 1,
    "So they give you a choice.": 1,
    " of what you want to hear on the other end.": 1,
    "So like, here's the girlfriend.": 1,
    "Hey, you.": 1,
    "What's going on?": 1,
    "I'm kind of like giving a talk right now.": 1,
    "Well, that's good.": 1,
    " What are you doing?": 1,
    "I don't know.": 1,
    "I was just wondering what you were up to.": 1,
    "Right.": 1,
    "I can't really talk right now.": 1,
    "I'm going up.": 1,
    "I love this.": 1,
    "The boss call.": 1,
    " This is Mr. Johnson, calling from the office.": 1,
    "Oh, hi sir.": 1,
    "Did you complete that thing about a month ago, that photocopier training?": 1,
    " Sorry for yeah, well, so when is when was the last time you used the photocopier?": 1,
    "It was like three weeks ago.": 1,
    "Well, I don't know if you heard you might have heard from Lenny, but well anyway, so": 1,
    " I think the biggest change when internet met phone was with the iPhone.": 1,
    "Not my finest moment in New York Times journalism was when in fall of 2006, I explained why Apple would never do a cell phone.": 1,
    " I looked like a moron, however, my logic was good, because I don't know if you realize this, but until the iPhone came along, the carriers held veto power over every aspect of every design of every phone.": 1,
    " I know the people who worked on the trio, and they went around to these carriers and said, look at these cool features, and Verizon was like, no, I don't think so.": 1,
    " And so it was not very conducive to innovation.": 1,
    "So what I didn't anticipate was that Steve Jobs went around and said, tell you what, I'll give you a five-year exclusive if you'll let me design this phone in peace and you won't even see it until it's done.": 1,
    " And actually, even so, he was turned down by Verizon and others.": 1,
    "Finally, Singular said, OK.": 1,
    "And I'm going to talk about the effect of the iPhone.": 1,
    "Please don't corner me at the party tonight and go, what are you, an Apple fanboy?": 1,
    "You know, I'm not.": 1,
    " You can see what I said about it.": 1,
    "It's a flawed masterpiece.": 1,
    "It's got bad things and good things.": 1,
    "Let's all acknowledge that right now.": 1,
    "But it did change a few things.": 1,
    "And the first thing it changed was that all those carriers saw that they sold 10 million of these things in a year.": 1,
    " and said, oh my gosh, maybe we've been doing it wrong.": 1,
    "Maybe we should let phone designers design the phones.": 1,
    " And another thing was it let 10 million people for the first time experience being online all the time, not using these $60 a month cellular cards for their laptops.": 1,
    " I don't understand why we're not there yet.": 1,
    "When I'm an old man, I'm going to tell my grandchildren, when I was your age, if I wanted to check my email, used to drive around town looking for a coffee shop.": 1,
    "I didn't.": 1,
    " Yo.": 1,
    " We are.": 1,
    " We had wireless base stations that could broadcast, yeah, 150 feet across.": 1,
    " It's absurd.": 1,
    "We have power outlets in every room of every building.": 1,
    "We have running water.": 1,
    "What's the problem?": 1,
    " Anyway, but this teaches people what it's like.": 1,
    "You have to go to YouTube and type in iPhone shuffle.": 1,
    "This guy did a mock video of one that's one inch square like the real iPod shuffle.": 1,
    "And it's like, it only has one button.": 1,
    " Touch it and it dials a number at random.": 1,
    " Who the hell is this?": 1,
