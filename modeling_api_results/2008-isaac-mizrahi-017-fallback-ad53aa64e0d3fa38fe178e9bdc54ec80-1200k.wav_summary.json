    "I love it.": 3,
    "I don't know.": 2,
    " I have like a thing about sleeping.": 1,
    "I don't sleep that much and I've come to this thing about like not sleeping much as being a great virtue after years of kind of battling it as being a terrible detriment to something.": 1,
    "And now I really like sort of sitting up.": 1,
    " But for years I've been sitting up and...": 1,
    " And I think that my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia.": 1,
    "I lie awake.": 1,
    "I think thoughts.": 1,
    "I walk aimlessly.": 1,
    "Sometimes I used to walk more at night.": 1,
    " I walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting.": 1,
    " And sometimes, actually once it was on page six in the post that I was cruising this guy like sort of whatever, but I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on and so I fell in the sky.": 1,
    " And I took a picture of his shoes and we thanked each other and just went on our way But I do that all the time as a matter of fact, I think a lot of my design": 1,
    " ideas come from mistakes and tricks of the eye.": 1,
    "Because I feel like, you know, there are so many images out there, so many clothes out there.": 1,
    " And the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look slightly mistaken, of course.": 1,
    " or very, very surprising.": 1,
    "And often, I'm driving in a taxi and I see a hole in a shirt or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that I'd never seen happen before.": 1,
    " And so, like, I make the car stop and I get out of the car and walk and see that, in fact, there wasn't a hole, but it was like a trick of my eye, it was a shadow, you know.": 1,
    " Or if there was a hole, I think, like, damn, there was actually someone thought of that thought already.": 1,
    "Someone made that mistake already, so I can't do it anymore.": 1,
    "I don't know where inspiration comes from.": 1,
    "It does not come": 1,
    " for me, from research.": 1,
    "I don't get necessarily inspired by research.": 1,
    "As a matter of fact, one of the most fun things I've ever, ever done in my whole life was this Christmas season at the Guggenheim.": 1,
    " In New York, I read Peter and the Wolf with this beautiful band from Juilliard, and I did like, you know, the narrator, and I read it.": 1,
    "And I saw this really smart critic who I love, this woman, Joan Eccocella, who's a friend of mine, and she came backstage and she said,": 1,
    " You know Isaac, did you know that like, you know, talk to me about Stalinism and talk to me about You know, like the 30s in Russia and I thought": 1,
    " I know about Stalinism.": 1,
    "I know about a wolf and a bird and you know, he ate the bird and then in the end you hear, you know, you hear the bird squeaking or something, you know.": 1,
    " So I don't really know that.": 1,
    "I don't really... Actually, I do my own kind of research.": 1,
    "If I'm commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th century opera, something like that...": 1,
    " I will do a lot of research because it's interesting, not because it's what I'm supposed to do.": 1,
    "I'm very, very, very inspired by movies, the color of movies and the way light makes the colors light from behind.": 1,
    " The projection or light from the projection makes the colors look so impossible and and and anyway roll this little clip I'll just show you I I you know I sort of again sit up at night and I watch movies and I watch women in movies a lot and": 1,
    " And I think about their roles and about how you have to watch what your daughters look at.": 1,
    " Because I look at the way women are portrayed all the time whether they're kind of glorified in this way Or whether they're kind of you know Ironically glorified": 1,
    " Or whether they're, you know, sort of denigrated or ironically denigrated.": 1,
    "I go back to color all the time.": 1,
    "Color is something that motivates me a lot.": 1,
    " It's rarely color that I find in nature, although juxtaposed next to artificial color.": 1,
    " Natural color is so beautiful.": 1,
    "So that's that's why do I study color a lot?": 1,
    "But for the most part I think": 1,
    " Like, how can I ever make anything that is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood?": 1,
    "How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo?": 1,
    "I mean, that's just not possible, you know?": 1,
    " And so that's what makes me lie awake at night, I guess.": 1,
    "I want to show you... I'm also like a big...": 1,
    " Go to astrologers and tarot card readers often.": 1,
    "And that's another thing that motivates me a lot.": 1,
    "People say, oh, do that.": 1,
    "You know, an astrologer tells me to do something.": 1,
    "So I do it.": 1,
    " When I was about 21, an astrologer told me that I was going to meet the man of my dreams and that his name was going to be Eric, right?": 1,
    " So, you know, for years I would go to bars and sort of anyone I met whose name was Eric, I was kind of humping immediately or something.": 1,
    " And there were times when I was actually so desperate I would just, you know, walk into a room and just go like, Eric!": 1,
    "And anybody who would turn around would sort of make a beeline for it.": 1,
    " And I had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago.": 1,
    "The last card he pulled, which was representing my destiny, was this guy in like a straw boater with a cane and like, you know, sort of spats and this, you know, minstrel singer, right?": 1,
    "I want to show you this clip because I do this.": 1,
    " kind of crazy thing where I do a cabaret act.": 1,
    "So actually check this out.": 1,
    "Very embarrassing.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    "You didn't do anything yet.": 1,
    "The name of the show is based on this story that I have to tell you about my mother.": 1,
    "It's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers.": 1,
    "I was dating this guy, right?": 1,
    " This has to do with being happy, I swear.": 1,
    "I was dating this guy, and...": 1,
    " It was going on for about a year, right?": 1,
    "And we were getting serious, so we decided to invite them all to dinner.": 1,
    "Our parents and we sort of introduced them to each other.": 1,
    "My mother was sort of": 1,
    " very sensitive to his mother, who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing, you know, homosexuality, right?": 1,
    "So my mother was a little offended.": 1,
    "She turned to her and she said,": 1,
    " Are you kidding?": 1,
    "They have the greatest life together.": 1,
    "They eat out, they see shows.": 1,
    " They eat out, they see shows.": 1,
    " That was, that's the name of the show.": 1,
    "They eat out, they, that's on my tombstone when I die.": 1,
    "He ate out, he saw shows, right?": 1,
    " So, you know, in editing these clips, I didn't have the audacity to edit a clip of me singing at Joe's pub.": 1,
    "So you'll have to, like, check it out and come see me or something because it's mortifying and yet...": 1,
    " It feels, I don't know how to put this, I feel as though as little comfort as possible is a good thing, you know?": 1,
    " And at least in my case, because if I just do one thing all the time, I don't know, I get very, very bored.": 1,
    "I get very bored.": 1,
    "I bore very easily.": 1,
    " I don't say that I do everything well.": 1,
    "I just say that I do a lot of things, that's all.": 1,
    "And I kind of try not to look back.": 1,
    " You know, except I guess that's what staying up every night is about, like looking back and thinking, what a fool you made of yourself, you know?": 1,
    "But I guess that's okay, right?": 1,
    " Because if you do many things, you get to feel lousy about everything, and not just one.": 1,
    "You don't master feeling lousy about one thing.": 1,
    "Yeah, exactly.": 1,
    " I will show you this next thing.": 1,
    "Speaking of costumes for operas, I do work with different choreographers.": 1,
    "I work with Twyla Thorpe a lot, and I work with Mark Morris a lot, who is one of my best friends, and I designed": 1,
    " Three operas with him and the most recent one, King Arthur.": 1,
    "I've been very ingrained in the dance world since I'm a teenager.": 1,
    "I went to performing arts high school.": 1,
    " where I was an actor and many of my friends were ballet dancers.": 1,
    "Again, I don't know where inspiration comes from.": 1,
    "I don't know where it comes from.": 1,
    "I started making puppets when I was a kid.": 1,
    " maybe that's where the whole inspiration thing started, from puppets, right?": 1,
    "And then, performing arts high school, there I was in high school, meeting dancers and acting, and somehow, from there,": 1,
    " I got interested in design.": 1,
    "I went to Parsons School of Design and then I began my career as a designer.": 1,
    " I don't really think of myself as a designer, and I don't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer.": 1,
    "And frankly, I don't really know what to call myself.": 1,
    "I think of myself as... I don't know what I think of myself as, so... It's just that.": 1,
    " But I must say, this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time, I think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer.": 1,
    "You always have to be slightly bored with everything.": 1,
    "And if you're not, you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything.": 1,
    " But I am really a little bored with everything.": 1,
    "I always say to my partner, Marisa Gardini, who books everything.": 1,
    "She books everything, and she makes everything happen, and she makes all the deals.": 1,
    " I always tell her that I find myself with a lot of time on the Computer Bridge program.": 1,
    "Too much time on Computer Bridge.": 1,
    " So somehow, about 10 years ago, I thought that the most unboring place in the world would be a TV studio for a day show, some kind of a day talk show, because it's all of these...": 1,
    " Things that I love kind of in one place and if you ever get bored You can look at another thing and do another thing and talk about it, right?": 1,
    " So I had this TV show and that was a very very very big part of my process actually Could you roll the clip, please?": 1,
    "This is one of my favorite clips of Rosie.": 1,
    "We're back on the set.": 1,
    "We're back on the set Look how cute she looks with this": 1,
    " Grandmother says delish Wow delish All right.": 1,
    "So now where should I position myself?": 1,
    "I want to stay out of the way.": 1,
    "I don't want to be okay.": 1,
    "Here you go.": 1,
    "Here we go Don't you get nervous Ashley?": 1,
    "I'm doing well": 1,
    " Cutting hair?": 1,
    "No, cutting hair?": 1,
    "Never.": 1,
    "I don't think there's ever a day where I cut hair, I was nervous.": 1,
    "You look so cute already, by the way.": 1,
    "You like it?": 1,
    "Yeah.": 1,
    "Do you have a problem with looking cute?": 1,
    "You want to look cute, right?": 1,
    " Some people want to look you know aggressively ugly You know you you read about all these people who have a lot of money and they have kids and the kids always end up somehow like": 1,
    " really messed up, you know what I mean?": 1,
    "And there's gotta be some way to do that, Rosie.": 1,
    "Just because if you're fabulously rich and fabulously famous, does that mean you shouldn't have kids because you know they're gonna end up getting messed up?": 1,
    " No, but it means that your priority has to be their well-being first, I think.": 1,
    "But you have to make the decision for yourself.": 1,
    "My kids are seven.": 1,
    "Who the hell knows?": 1,
    "They're going to be like 14 and in rehab, and they're going to be playing this clip.": 1,
    "I'm such a good mother.": 1,
    " My god, this is the shortest I've ever had.": 1,
    "It looks good, right?": 1,
    "I was about to ask you, has your head ever been closer to the shore?": 1,
    "No!": 1,
    "But it's all right, I'm going crazy.": 1,
    "I feel like it needs to be a little closer down here.": 1,

    "I mean, like making someone who's already cute look terrible like that.": 1,
    "That is not boring.": 1,
    "That is nothing if it's not boring.": 1,
    " Actually, I read this great quote the other day, which was, style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you're going to die, right?": 1,
    " And then I realized that that was on my website.": 1,
    "And then it said like, you know, the quote was attributed to me.": 1,
    "And I thought, oh, I said something, you know, in an interview.": 1,
    "I forgot that I said that, you know, but it's really true.": 1,
    "I want to show you this last clip because it's going to be my last.": 1,
    " Goodbye, I'll tell you that I cook a lot also I love to cook and I often look at things as though they're food Like I say, oh, you know, would you serve a rotten chicken?": 1,
    "Then?": 1,
    "How could you serve, you know a beat-up old dress or something?": 1,

    " And so I think that that's what it all boils down to.": 1,
    "Everything boils down to that.": 1,
    "So check this out.": 1,
    "This is what I've been doing because I think it's the most fun thing in the world.": 1,
    "It's like this website.": 1,
    "It's got a lot of different things on it.": 1,
    "It's a polymathematical website.": 1,
    " We actually shoot segments, like TV show segments, and it's kind of my favorite thing in the world.": 1,
    "And it just began, like in the beginning of February, so who knows?": 1,
    "Again, I don't say it's good, I just think it's not boring.": 1,
    "Right?": 1,
    "And here's the last bit.": 1,
    " I have to tell you, I make buttermilk pancakes or buttermilk waffles all the time.": 1,
    "Do you?": 1,
    "Yeah, but I can never find buttermilk, ever.": 1,
    "Oh!": 1,
    "Like, you can't find buttermilk at Cinderella.": 1,
    "You can't find buttermilk.": 1,
    " It's always low-fat buttermilk.": 1,
    "No, but that's all it is.": 1,
    "Is that all it is?": 1,
    "Oh, you don't know?": 1,
    "Oh, okay.": 1,
    "I'm sorry.": 1,
    "Let me tell you something interesting.": 1,
    "You know what?": 1,
    "Stop laughing.": 1,
    "It's not funny, just because I don't know that whole, you know, there's no such thing as whole buttermilk.": 1,
    "Sorry, what?": 1,
    " Here's the deal, let me tell you the deal.": 1,
    "In the old days when they used to make butter, you know how you make butter?": 1,
    " You take heavy, high fat milk, which is cream, and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water.": 1,
    "The liquid is actually that clear liquid.": 1,
    "If you've ever over-beaten your whipped cream,": 1,
    " It's actually buttermilk.": 1,
    "And that's what it was in the early days.": 1,
    "And that's what people used for baking and all sorts of things.": 1,
    "Now the buttermilk that you get is actually low-fat or skim milk.": 1,
    " The reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious.": 1,
    "So who would think that it was low fat?": 1,
    " Well, that's it.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1,
    "Happy TED.": 1,
