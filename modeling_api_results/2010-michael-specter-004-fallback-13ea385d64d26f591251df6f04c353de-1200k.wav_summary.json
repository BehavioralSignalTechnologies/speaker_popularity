    "I don't know.": 2,
    "And why?": 2,
    "Why do we do that?": 2,
    "Disgraceful.": 2,
    " Thank you.": 2,
    " Let's pretend right here we have a machine, a big machine, a cool, teddish machine.": 1,
    "And it's a time machine.": 1,
    "And everyone in this room has to get into it.": 1,
    "And you can go backwards.": 1,
    "You can go forwards.": 1,
    "You cannot stay where you are.": 1,
    " And I wonder what you'd choose, because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lately, and they all want to go back.": 1,
    "They want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or American Idol.": 1,
    " I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull to nostalgia, to wishful thinking, and I understand that.": 1,
    "I'm not part of that crowd, I have to say.": 1,
    " I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adventurous.": 1,
    "It's because possibilities on this planet, they don't go back.": 1,
    "They go forward.": 1,
    "So I want to get in the machine, and I want to go forward.": 1,
    " This is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet.": 1,
    "By any measure that you wish to choose, health, wealth, mobility, opportunity, declining rates of disease, there's never been a time like this.": 1,
    " My great grandparents died, all of them, by the time they were 60.": 1,
    "My grandparents pushed that number to 70.": 1,
    "My parents are closing in on 80, so there better be a": 1,
    " There better be a nine in the beginning of my death number.": 1,
    "But it's not even about people like us, because this is a bigger deal than that.": 1,
    "A kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago.": 1,
    " Think about that.": 1,
    "It's an incredible fact.": 1,
    "And why is it true?": 1,
    "Smallpox.": 1,
    "Smallpox killed billions of people on this planet.": 1,
    "It reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has.": 1,
    "It's gone.": 1,
    " It's vanished.": 1,
    "We've vanquished it.": 1,
    "Poof.": 1,
    "In the rich world, diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist hardly.": 1,
    "Diphtheria, rubella, polio.": 1,
    "Does anyone even know what those things are?": 1,
    " Vaccines, modern medicine, our ability to feed billions of people.": 1,
    "Those are triumphs of the scientific method.": 1,
    "And to my mind, the scientific method, trying stuff out,": 1,
    " Seeing if it works, changing it when it doesn't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity.": 1,
    "So that's the good news.": 1,
    "Unfortunately, that's all the good news because there's some other problems and they've been mentioned many times and one of them is that": 1,
    " Despite all our accomplishments, a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day.": 1,
    "That number's rising, and it's rising really rapidly, and it's disgraceful.": 1,
    "And not only that, we've used our imagination": 1,
    " to thoroughly trash this globe.": 1,
    "Potable water, arable land, rainforest, oil, gas, they're going away.": 1,
    "And they're going away soon.": 1,
    "And unless we innovate our way out of this mess, we're going away too.": 1,
    " So the question is, can we do that?": 1,
    "And I think we can.": 1,
    "I think it's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on.": 1,
    "I think we can power this world with energy that doesn't also destroy it.": 1,
    " I really do believe that, and no, it ain't wishful thinking.": 1,
    "But here's the thing that keeps me up at night, one of the things that keeps me up at night.": 1,
    " We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now.": 1,
    "Never.": 1,
    "And we've also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today.": 1,
    "We're on the verge of amazing, amazing events in many fields.": 1,
    " And yet, I actually think we'd have to go back hundreds, 300 years before the Enlightenment to find a time when we battled progress, when we fought about these things more vigorously on more fronts than we do now.": 1,
    " People wrap themselves in their beliefs, and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free.": 1,
    "Not even the truth will set them free.": 1,
    "And listen.": 1,
    " Everyone's entitled to their opinion.": 1,
    "They're even entitled to their opinion about progress.": 1,
    "But you know what you're not entitled to?": 1,
    "You're not entitled to your own facts.": 1,
    " Sorry, you're not.": 1,
    "And this took me a while to figure out.": 1,
    "About a decade ago, I wrote a story about vaccines for the New Yorker, a little story, and I was amazed to find opposition.": 1,
    "Opposition to what is, after all, the most effective public health measure in human history.": 1,
    " I didn't know what to do.": 1,
    "So I just did what I do.": 1,
    "I wrote a story and I moved on.": 1,
    "And soon after that,": 1,
    " I wrote a story about genetically engineered food.": 1,
    "Same thing, only bigger.": 1,
    "People were going crazy.": 1,
    " I wrote a story about that too, and I couldn't understand why people thought this was frankenfoods, why they thought moving molecules around in a specific rather than a haphazard way was trespassing on nature's ground.": 1,
    " But I do what I do.": 1,
    "I wrote this story.": 1,
    "I moved on.": 1,
    "I'm a journalist.": 1,
    "We type.": 1,
    "We file.": 1,
    "We go to dinner.": 1,
    "It's fun.": 1,
    " But these stories bothered me, and I couldn't figure out why, and eventually I did.": 1,
    "And that's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren't actually fanatics at all.": 1,
    "They were thoughtful people, educated people, decent people.": 1,
    "They were exactly like the people in this room.": 1,
    " And it just disturbed me so much but then I thought, you know, let's be honest.": 1,
    "We're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to.": 1,
    "We talk about it ambivalently.": 1,
    "We talk about it": 1,
    " in ironic terms with little quotes around it.": 1,
    "Progress.": 1,
    " Okay, there are reasons for that, and I think we know what those reasons are.": 1,
    "We've lost faith in institutions, in authority, and sometimes in science itself, and there's no reason we shouldn't have.": 1,
    "You can just say a few names and people will understand.": 1,
    " Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger.": 1,
    " Vioxx, weapons of mass destruction, hanging chads.": 1,
    "I mean, you know, you can choose your list.": 1,
    "There are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right.": 1,
    "So be skeptical.": 1,
    " Ask questions.": 1,
    "Demand proof.": 1,
    "Demand evidence.": 1,
    "Don't take anything for granted.": 1,
    "But here's the thing.": 1,
    "When you get proof, you need to accept the proof.": 1,
    "And we're not that good at doing that.": 1,
    " And the reason that I can say that is because we're now in an epidemic of fear like one that I've never seen and hope never to see again.": 1,
    "About 12 years ago there was a story published, a horrible story.": 1,
    " that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine shot.": 1,
    "Very scary.": 1,
    "Tons of studies were done to see if this was true.": 1,
    "Tons of studies should have been done.": 1,
    "It's a serious issue.": 1,
    " The data came back.": 1,
    "The data came back from the United States, from England, from Sweden, from Canada, and it was all the same.": 1,
    "No correlation.": 1,
    "No connection.": 1,
    "None at all.": 1,
    "Doesn't matter.": 1,
    "It doesn't matter because we believe anecdotes.": 1,
    " We believe what we see, what we think we see, what makes us feel real.": 1,
    "We don't believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data.": 1,
    "And I do understand that.": 1,
    "I think we all do.": 1,
    "But you know what?": 1,
    " The result of that has been disastrous, disastrous, because here's a fact.": 1,
    " The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down.": 1,
    "That is disgraceful and we should be ashamed of ourselves.": 1,
    "It's horrible.": 1,
    " And what kind of a thing happened that we could do that?": 1,
    "Now, I understand it.": 1,
    "I do understand it because anyone have measles here?": 1,
    "Does one person in this audience ever see someone die of measles?": 1,
    "Doesn't happen very much.": 1,
    " It doesn't happen in this country at all, but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year.": 1,
    "That's a lot of death of measles, 20 an hour.": 1,
    " But since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our minds.": 1,
    "And people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like Oprah.": 1,
    " and Larry King Live.": 1,
    "And they can do it because they don't link causation and correlation.": 1,
    "They don't understand that these things seem the same, but they're almost never the same.": 1,
    "And it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn it really soon.": 1,
    " This guy was a hero, Jonas Salk.": 1,
    "He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us.": 1,
    "No fear, no agony, polio, poof, gone.": 1,
    " That guy in the middle, not so much.": 1,
    "His name is Paul Offit.": 1,
    "He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people.": 1,
    "It'll save the lives of 400, 500,000 kids in the developing world every year.": 1,
    "Pretty good, right?": 1,
    " Well, it's good, except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are, and that people ought to just stop the whining.": 1,
    "And he actually says it that way.": 1,
    "So Paul's a terrorist.": 1,
    " When Paul speaks in a public hearing, he can't testify without armed guards.": 1,
    "He gets called at home because people like to tell them that they remember where his kids go to school.": 1,
    "Because Paul made a vaccine.": 1,
    " I don't need to say this, but vaccines are essential.": 1,
    "You take them away, disease comes back.": 1,
    "Horrible diseases.": 1,
    "And that's happening.": 1,
    "We have measles in this country now, and it's getting worse.": 1,
    "And pretty soon, kids are going to die again because it's just a numbers game.": 1,
    " And they're not just going to die of measles.": 1,
    "What about polio?": 1,
    "Let's have that.": 1,
    "Why not?": 1,
    "A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident.": 1,
    "No one's ever said that before.": 1,
    " She wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio.": 1,
    "No way.": 1,
    "Fine.": 1,
    " Why?": 1,
    "Because we don't have polio.": 1,
    "We didn't have polio in this country yesterday.": 1,
    "Today, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning and he's flying to LAX right now.": 1,
    "He's over Ohio.": 1,
    " And he's going to land in a couple hours, he's going to rent a car, and he's going to come to Long Beach.": 1,
    "And he's going to attend one of these fabulous Ted dinners tonight.": 1,
    " And he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease, and we know either, because that's the way the world works.": 1,
    "That's the planet we live on.": 1,
    "Don't pretend it isn't.": 1,
    "Now, we love to wrap ourselves in lies.": 1,
    "We love to do it.": 1,
    "Everyone take their vitamins this morning.": 1,
    " Echinacea, little echinacea, little antioxidant to get you going.": 1,
    "I know you did because half of Americans do every day.": 1,
    "They take this stuff and they take alternative medicines and it doesn't matter how often we find out that": 1,
    " They're useless.": 1,
    "The data says it all the time.": 1,
    "They darken your urine.": 1,
    "They almost never do more than that.": 1,
    " It's okay, you want to pay $28 billion for dark urine, I'm totally with you.": 1,
    " Dark urine.": 1,
    "Dark.": 1,
    " Why do we do that?": 1,
    "Well, I think I understand.": 1,
    "We hate big pharma.": 1,
    "We hate big government.": 1,
    "We don't trust the man.": 1,
    "And we shouldn't.": 1,
    "Our health care system sucks.": 1,
    " It's cruel to millions of people.": 1,
    "It's absolutely astonishingly cold and soul-deadening to those of us who can even afford it.": 1,
    "So we run away from it, and where do we run?": 1,
    "We leap into the arms of big placebo.": 1,
    " That's fantastic.": 1,
    "I love big placebo.": 1,
    " But it's really a serious thing, because this stuff is crap.": 1,
    "And we spend billions of dollars on it.": 1,
    "And I have all sorts of little props here.": 1,
    "None of it.": 1,
    "Ginkgo fraud.": 1,
    " Echinacea, fraud.": 1,
    "Akai, I don't even know what that is, but we're spending billions of dollars on it.": 1,
    "It's fraud.": 1,
    "When I say this stuff, people scream at me and they say, what do you care?": 1,
    "Let people do what they want to do.": 1,
    "It makes me feel good.": 1,
    " you're wrong because I don't care if it's the secretary of HHS who's saying, hmm, I'm not going to take the evidence of my experts on the mammograms.": 1,
    " or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas.": 1,
    "When you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science, you end up in a place you don't want to be.": 1,
    "You end up in Thabo and Beki, South Africa.": 1,
    " He killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot, garlic, and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS.": 1,
    " Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease.": 1,
    "Please don't tell me there are no consequences to these things.": 1,
    "There are.": 1,
    "There always are.": 1,
    " The most mindless epidemic we're in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite.": 1,
    " It's an idiotic debate.": 1,
    "It has to stop.": 1,
    "It's a debate about words, about metaphors.": 1,
    "It's ideology.": 1,
    "It's not science.": 1,
    "Every single thing we eat, every grain of rice, every": 1,
    " every sprig of parsley, every Brussels sprout has been modified by man.": 1,
    "You know, there weren't tangerines in the Garden of Eden.": 1,
    "There wasn't any cantaloupe.": 1,
    "There weren't Christmas trees.": 1,
    "We made it all.": 1,
    "We made it over the last 11,000 years.": 1,
    " And some of it worked, and some of it didn't.": 1,
    "We got rid of the stuff that didn't.": 1,
    "Now we can do it in a more precise way.": 1,
    "And there are risks, absolutely.": 1,
    "But we can put something like vitamin A into rice.": 1,
    "And that stuff can help millions of people, millions of people prolong their lives.": 1,
    " You don't want to do that?": 1,
    "I have to say I don't understand it.": 1,
    "We object to genetically engineered food.": 1,
    "Well, the things I constantly hear are": 1,
    " Too many chemicals, pesticides, hormones, monoculture.": 1,
    "We don't want giant fields of the same thing.": 1,
    "It's wrong.": 1,
    " We don't want companies patenting life.": 1,
    "We don't want companies owning seeds.": 1,
    "And you know what my response to all of that is?": 1,
    "Yes, you're right.": 1,
    "Let's fix it.": 1,
    "It's true.": 1,
    "We've got a huge food problem, but this isn't science.": 1,
    " This has nothing to do with science.": 1,
    "It's law, it's morality, it's patent stuff.": 1,
    "You know, science isn't a company.": 1,
    "It's not a country.": 1,
    "It's not even an idea.": 1,
    "It's a process.": 1,
    " It's a process.": 1,
    "And sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.": 1,
    "But the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we're afraid": 1,
    " is really very deadening, and it's preventing millions of people from prospering.": 1,
    "You know, in the next?": 1,
    " 50 years, we're going to have to grow 70% more food than we do right now.": 1,
    "This is investment in Africa over the last 30 years.": 1,
    "They need it, and we're not giving it to them.": 1,
    " genetically engineered food.": 1,
    "We don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff.": 1,
    "Like cassava, for instance.": 1,
    "Cassava is something that half a billion people eat.": 1,
    "It's kind of like a potato.": 1,
    "It's just a bunch of calories.": 1,
    "It sucks.": 1,
    " It doesn't have nutrients.": 1,
    "It doesn't have protein.": 1,
    "And scientists are engineering all of that into it right now.": 1,
    "And then people would be able to eat it, and they'd be able to not go blind.": 1,
    "They wouldn't starve.": 1,
    "That would be nice.": 1,
    "It wouldn't be Chez Panisse, but it would be nice.": 1,
    " And all I can say about this is, why are we fighting it?": 1,
    "Let's ask ourselves, why are we fighting it?": 1,
    "Because we don't want to move genes around.": 1,
    "This is about moving genes around.": 1,
    "It's not about chemicals.": 1,
    " It's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones, our insistence on having bigger food, better food, singular food.": 1,
    "This isn't about Rice Krispies.": 1,
    "This is about keeping people alive.": 1,
    "And it's about time we started to understand what that meant.": 1,
    "Because you know something?": 1,
    " And if we don't, if we continue to act the way we're acting, we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of.": 1,
    "High-tech colonialism.": 1,
    "There's no other way to describe what's going on here.": 1,
    "It's selfish.": 1,
    " It's ugly.": 1,
    "It's beneath us.": 1,
    "And we really have to stop it.": 1,
    "So after this amazingly fun conversation,": 1,
    " You might want to say, so you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward?": 1,
    "And absolutely, absolutely.": 1,
    "I do.": 1,
    "It's stuck in the present right now.": 1,
    "But we have an amazing opportunity.": 1,
    "We can set that time machine on anything we want.": 1,
    " We can move it where we want to move it.": 1,
    "And we're going to move it where we want to move it.": 1,
    "We have to have these conversations and we have to think.": 1,
    "But when we get in the time machine and we go ahead, we're going to be happy we do.": 1,
    "I know that we can.": 1,
    " And as far as I'm concerned, that's something the world needs right now.": 1
