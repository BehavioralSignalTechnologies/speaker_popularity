    " I know a man who soars above the city every night.": 1,
    " In his dreams, he twirls and swirls with his toes kissing the earth.": 1,
    "Everything has motion, he claims, even a body as paralyzed as his own.": 1,
    " This man is my father.": 1,
    " Three years ago, when I found out that my father had suffered a severe stroke in his brain stem, I walked into his room in the ICU at the Montreal Neurological Institute": 1,
    " and found him lying deathly still, tethered to a breathing machine.": 1,
    "Paralysis had closed over his body slowly, beginning in his toes, then legs, torso, fingers and arms.": 1,
    " It made its way up his neck, cutting off his ability to breathe, and stopped just beneath the eyes.": 1,
    " He never lost consciousness.": 1,
    "Rather, he watched from within as his body shut down, limb by limb, muscle by muscle.": 1,
    " In that ICU room, I walked up to my father's body, and with a quivering voice and through tears, I began reciting the alphabet.": 1,
    " A B C": 1,
    " D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K. At K he blinked his eyes.": 1,
    "I began again.": 1,
    "A, B, C, D,": 1,
    " E, F, G, H, I. He blinked again at the letter I, then at T, then at R, and A. Ketra.": 1,
    " He said, Ketra, my beauty, don't cry.": 1,
    "This is a blessing.": 1,
    " There was no audible voice, but my father called out my name powerfully.": 1,
    "Just 72 hours after his stroke, he had already embraced the totality of his condition.": 1,
    " Despite his extreme physical state, he was completely present with me, guiding, nurturing, and being my father as much, if not more than ever before.": 1,
    " Locked-in syndrome is many people's worst nightmare.": 1,
    "In French, it's sometimes called maladie de la mureille vivante, literally, walled in a live disease.": 1,
    " For many people, perhaps most paralysis is an unspeakable horror.": 1,
    "But my father's experience losing every system of his body was not an experience of feeling trapped.": 1,
    " but rather of turning the psyche inwards, dimming down the external chatter, facing the recesses of his own mind, and in that place,": 1,
    " falling in love with life and body anew.": 1,
    " As a rabbi and spiritual man dangling between mind and body, life and death, the paralysis opened up a new awareness for him.": 1,
    " He realized he no longer needed to look beyond the corporeal world in order to find the divine.": 1,
    "Paradise is in this body.": 1,
    "It's in this world, he said.": 1,
    " I slept by my father's side for the first four months, tending as much as I could to his every discomfort, understanding the deep human psychological fear of not being able to call out for help.": 1,
    " My mother, sisters, brother and I, we surrounded him in the cocoon of healing.": 1,
    " we became his mouthpiece, spending hours each day reciting the alphabet as he whispered back sermons and poetry with blinks of his eye.": 1,
    " His room, it became our temple of healing.": 1,
    "His bedside became a site for those seeking advice and spiritual counsel, and through us,": 1,
    " My father was able to speak and uplift, letter by letter, blink by blink.": 1,
    " Everything in our world became slow and tender as the din, drama, and death of the hospital ward faded into the background.": 1,
    " I want to read to you one of the first things that we transcribed in the week following the stroke.": 1,
    " He composed a letter addressing his synagogue congregation and ended it with the following lines.": 1,
    " When my nape exploded, I entered another dimension, inchoate, subplanetary, protozoan.": 1,
    " Universes are opened and closed continually.": 1,
    "There are many when low who stop growing.": 1,
    " Last week I was brought so low, but I felt the hand of my father around me, and my father brought me back.": 1,
    " When we weren't his voice, we were his legs and arms.": 1,
    "I moved them like I know I would have wanted my own arms and legs to be moved were they still for all the hours of the day.": 1,
    " I remember I'd hold his fingers near my face, bending each joint to keep it soft and limber.": 1,
    "I'd ask him again and again to visualize the motion.": 1,
    " to watch from within as the finger curled and extended, and to move along with it in his mind.": 1,
    " Then one day, from the corner of my eye, I saw his body slither like a snake, an involuntary spasm passing through the course of his limbs.": 1,
    " At first, I thought it was my own hallucination, having spent so much time tending to this one body so desperate to see anything react on its own.": 1,
    "But he told me he felt tingles.": 1,
    " sparks of electricity flickering on and off just beneath the surface of his skin.": 1,
    " The following week, he began ever so slightly to show muscle resistance.": 1,
    "Connections were being made.": 1,
    "Body was slowly and gently reawakening.": 1,
    " limb by limb, muscle by muscle, twitch by twitch.": 1,
    " As a documentary photographer, I felt the need to photograph each of his first movements like a mother with her newborn.": 1,
    "I photographed him taking his first unaided breath.": 1,
    " the celebratory moment after he showed muscle resistance for the very first time, the new adaptive technologies that allowed him to gain more and more independence.": 1,
    " I photographed the care and the love that surrounded him.": 1,
    " But my photographs only told the outside story of a man lying in a hospital bed attached to a breathing machine.": 1,
    " I wasn't able to portray his story from within, and so I began to search for a new visual language, one which strived to express the ephemeral quality of his spiritual experience.": 1,
    " Finally, I want to share with you a video from a series that I've been working on that tries to express the slow in-between existence that my father has experienced.": 1,
    "As he began to regain his ability to breathe,": 1,
    " I started recording his thoughts.": 1,
    "And so the voice that you hear in this video is his voice.": 1,
    " You have to believe your paralyzed to play the part of a quadriplegic.": 1,
    " I don't.": 1,
    " in my mind and in my dreams every night.": 1,
    " I should call man float over the city, twirl and swirl with my toes.": 1,
    " Kissing the floor.": 1,
    " I know nothing about the statement of man without motion.": 1,
    " Everything else must.": 1,
    " The art box.": 1,
    "The party.": 1,
    " The mouth moves.": 1,
    " We never stagnate.": 1,
    "Life triumphs up and down.": 1,
    " For most of us, our muscles begin to twitch and move long before we are conscious.": 1,
    "But my father tells me his privilege is living on the far periphery of the human experience.": 1,
    " Like an astronaut who sees a perspective that very few of us will ever get to share, he wonders and watches as he takes his first breath and dreams about crawling back home.": 1,
    " So begins life at 57, he says.": 1,
    "A toddler has no attitude in its being, but a man insists on his world every day.": 1,
    " Few of us will ever have to face physical limitations to the degree that my father has.": 1,
    " but we will all have moments of paralysis in our lives.": 1,
    "I know I frequently confront walls that feel completely unscalable.": 1,
    " But my father insists that there are no dead ends.": 1,
    "Instead, he invites me into his space of co-healing.": 1,
    " to give the very best of myself and for him to give the very best of himself to me.": 1,
    "Paralysis was an opening for him.": 1,
    "It was an opportunity to emerge, to rekindle life force,": 1,
    " to sit still long enough with himself so as to fall in love with the full continuum of creation.": 1,
    " Today, my father is no longer locked in.": 1,
    "He moves his neck with ease, has had his feeding peg removed, breathes with his own lungs.": 1,
    " speaks slowly with his own quiet voice and works every day to gain more movement in his paralyzed body.": 1,
    " But the work will never be finished as he says, I'm living in a broken world and there is holy work to do.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
