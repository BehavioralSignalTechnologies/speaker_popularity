    " What do you think?": 1,
    "Whoever saw Sir Ken's lecture, memorable in TED, I am a typical example of what he describes as a body carrying a head.": 1,
    " a university professor.": 1,
    "And you might think that it's a cowardice to put me after these two first presentations to talk about science.": 1,
    "I can't balance my body in a rhythm.": 1,
    " e depois de um cientista que se tornou fil\u00f3sofo, eu tinha que falar da sil\u00eancia dura.": 1,
    "Poderia ser um tema muito \u00e1rido.": 1,
    "No entanto, eu me sinto agraciado.": 1,
    "Nunca na minha carreira": 1,
    " and it goes a long way in my career, I had the opportunity to start a lecture with the size of inspiration, like this one.": 1,
    "Usually talking about science is like exercising in an arid land.": 1,
    " However, I was happy to be invited to come here and talk about water.": 1,
    " And water and acid don't match, right?": 1,
    " It's even better to talk about water in the Amazon, which is a splendid spring of life, fresh.": 1,
    " So, it's what inspired me.": 1,
    "And that's why I'm here, even though my head is full of bad things, I'm here trying, I'll try to convey this inspiration.": 1,
    "I hope the story inspires you, that you multiply it.": 1,
    " We know that": 1,
    " Controversy, Amazonia, the world's lung, right?": 1,
    " for the power that it has of massively exchanging vital gases, the forest with the atmosphere.": 1,
    "We also hear about the seal of biodiversity, although many": 1,
    " Believe it or not, few people know it.": 1,
    "If you go out here in Singapore, you'll be amazed by the...": 1,
    " You can hardly see the animals.": 1,
    "The Indians say that in the forest there are more eyes than leaves.": 1,
    " And it's real, and I'll try to show you something.": 1,
    "But today I brought another approach here, an approach inspired by these two initiatives here, one harmonic and the other philosophical.": 1,
    "I'll try to put the approach": 1,
    " which is a bit material, but it also tries to convey that there is, in nature, an extraordinary philosophy and harmony.": 1,
    "There won't be music in my presentation, but I hope you'll see a song from reality that I'll show you.": 1,
    " Speaking of physiology, it's not lung, it's other analogies with human physiology, and especially heart.": 1,
    "We start...": 1,
    " thinking that water is like blood.": 1,
    " The circulation in our body takes the fresh blood that feeds, nourishes and sustains, and brings back the blood used to be renewed.": 1,
    " In the Amazon, very similar things happen, and we start talking about the power of all these processes.": 1,
    "This is...": 1,
    " an image in motion of the rains.": 1,
    "What you are seeing there is the years passing by every second.": 1,
    "There are rains all over the world.": 1,
    "What do you see?": 1,
    " that the equatorial region, in particular the Amazon, is very important for the climate of the world.": 1,
    "It's a powerful engine.": 1,
    " There is here a frenetic activity in relation to evaporation.": 1,
    "If we look at another image that shows the flow of water vapor,": 1,
    " What is black is dry air, what is gray is wet air, and what is white is clouds.": 1,
    "You see there an extraordinary resurgence in the Amazon.": 1,
    " What phenomenon, if it's not a desert, what phenomenon causes the water to flow from the soil to the atmosphere with the size of power that we see from space?": 1,
    " What phenomenon is this?": 1,
    "It could be a geyser, right?": 1,
    "The geyser is the underground water heated by the magma heat that explodes into the atmosphere.": 1,
    "It transfers this water to the atmosphere.": 1,
    " We don't have geysers in the Amazon, unless I'm mistaken, I don't know if anyone knows any, but we have something that does the same thing.": 1,
    " but with much more elegance.": 1,
    "They are the friendly and well-behaved trees that, like geysers,": 1,
    " can transmit a huge amount of water from the soil to the atmosphere.": 1,
    "There are 600 billion trees in the Amazon.": 1,
    "600 billion geysers.": 1,
    " And this, with an extraordinary sophistication, they don't need the heat of the magma, they use the sunlight to do this process.": 1,
    "So, on a typical sunny day in the Amazon,": 1,
    " A big tree can put 1,000 liters of water through its perspiration.": 1,
    "1,000 liters.": 1,
    "If you take all the...": 1,
    " The whole Amazon, which is a very large area, and you add all this water that is being sweat, the sweat of the forest, you reach an extraordinary number, 20 billion tons of water.": 1,
    " You know this in one day.": 1,
    "Do you know how much it is?": 1,
    " The Amazon River, the largest river on Earth, one-fifth of all fresh water that comes out of the continents of the entire world and reaches the oceans.": 1,
    "It spills 17 billion tons of water a day in the Atlantic Ocean.": 1,
    " This steam river that comes out of the forest and goes into the atmosphere is bigger than the Amazon River, just for you to have an idea.": 1,
    "If we could get a big kettle, the one you put in the tank, the electric kettle,": 1,
    " and put all these 20 billion tons inside, how much electricity would you need to evaporate this water?": 1,
    "Does anyone have an idea?": 1,
    "It's a really big waterfall.": 1,
    "The giant waterfall, right?": 1,
    " 50,000 Itaipus.": 1,
    "Itaipu, for those who don't know, is the largest hydroelectric in the world, and it's a Brazilian pride, because it provides more than 30% of the energy consumed in Brazil.": 1,
    " And Amazonia is here doing this for free.": 1,
    "It's a very powerful and alive plant of environmental services.": 1,
    " Connecting to this theme, we'll talk about what I call the paradox of luck, which is a curiosity": 1,
    " If you look at the Munde map, it's easy to see.": 1,
    "You can see that in the equatorial zone there are the forests, and the deserts are organized at 30 degrees north latitude and 30 degrees south latitude.": 1,
    " Aligned.": 1,
    "I see it in the southern hemisphere, the Atacama, in Mibika Lahari in Africa, in the Australian desert, in the northern hemisphere, the Sahara, Sonoma, etc.": 1,
    " One exception, and it's a curiosity, is the quadrilateral that goes from Cuiab\u00e1 to Buenos Aires, from S\u00e3o Paulo to the Andes.": 1,
    "This quadrilateral was meant to be a desert.": 1,
    "It's in the desert line.": 1,
    " Because it's not.": 1,
    "That's why I call it the paradox of luck.": 1,
    "What's different in South America?": 1,
    " If we could use the analogy of blood circulation in the body and blood with water circulation in the landscape,": 1,
    " We see in the rivers that they are veins, they drain the landscape, they drain the fabric of nature.": 1,
    "Where are the arteries?": 1,
    "Any palpitations?": 1,
    " What does it take?": 1,
    "How does water irrigate the tissues of nature and bring everything back to the rivers?": 1,
    "There's a new kind of river.": 1,
    " that is born in the blue ocean?": 1,
    " He flew in.": 1,
    " by the Green Ocean.": 1,
    "Not only does it flow, but it's also bombed by the Green Ocean.": 1,
    "And Cujaf\u00f3s is our land.": 1,
    "All of our economy, that quadrilateral, 70% of the GDP of South America comes from that region.": 1,
    " depends on this river.": 1,
    "And this river flows invisibly.": 1,
    "We're floating here in this floating river, in one of the largest rivers on Earth, the Black River.": 1,
    "It's a bit dry, a bit rough, but we're floating here.": 1,
    "And on top of us there's an invisible river passing by.": 1,
    " And this river, it pulses.": 1,
    "And here is the pulsation of it.": 1,
    "That's why we talk about the heart too.": 1,
    " You see there the seasons of the year, it rains, at one time, in the Amazon we used to have two seasons, the humid and the driest.": 1,
    "Now we have the dry season.": 1,
    " And you can see there him licking this region, which should otherwise be a desert.": 1,
    "It's not.": 1,
    " We, scientists, you see that I have difficulty here to take my head from one side to the other.": 1,
    "Scientists study how it works, why, etc.": 1,
    "And these studies are generating a series of": 1,
    " absolutely extraordinary discoveries to bring us the awareness of the richness, the complexity and the wonder we have, the symphony we have in these works.": 1,
    " One of them is how the rain is formed.": 1,
    "Above the Amazon there is clean air, just like above the ocean.": 1,
    "The blue ocean has clean air and it forms very few clouds, almost no rain.": 1,
    " In the Green Ocean, there is as much clean air as there is rain.": 1,
    "What happens here that is different?": 1,
    "The forest emits smells, and these smells are condensation nuclei that form drops in the atmosphere.": 1,
    " And then the rain forms, the clouds that rain torrentially.": 1,
    "It is the rain of the Garden of Eden.": 1,
    " Essa rela\u00e7\u00e3o...": 1,
    " of a living entity, which is the forest, with a non-living entity, which is the atmosphere, is virtuous in the Amazon.": 1,
    "Because the forest throws water, throws seeds,": 1,
    " Atmosphere forms, rain returns and guarantees the survival of the forest.": 1,
    "There are other factors as well.": 1,
    "Let's talk a little bit about the heart.": 1,
    "Now let's talk about another function, the liver.": 1,
    " Aromid, high humidity and radiation are combined together with these compounds, which I call exogenous vitamin C. Generous gas vitamin C. Plants release antioxidants,": 1,
    " that react with pollutants.": 1,
    " You can rest assured that you are breathing the purest air of the land here in the Amazon.": 1,
    "Because the plants are also taking care of this characteristic.": 1,
    "And this favors the very functioning of the plants, another virtuous cycle.": 1,
    "Speaking of...": 1,
    " fractals and the relationship with our functioning, we see other comparisons.": 1,
    "As in the upper parts of the lung, the air in the Amazon is clean from the excess of dust.": 1,
    " The air we breathe is clean from the dust by the airways.": 1,
    "This prevents the excess of dust from harming the rain.": 1,
    "When there are fires in the Amazon, the smoke ends with the rain.": 1,
    "It stops raining.": 1,
    "The forest dries up and the fire comes in.": 1,
    " There is another fractal analogy, as in veins and arteries there is a return to water that rains and returns to the atmosphere, as in endocrine glands and hormones,": 1,
    " you have those gases that I explained to you that form, I mean, as if they were hormones released in the atmosphere that promote the formation of the shul.": 1,
    " as the liver and the kidneys, I just said, the air cleaning, and finally, as the heart, the pumping of the water that comes from outside.": 1,
    " from the ocean into the forest.": 1,
    "We are calling this the biotic bomb of humidity.": 1,
    "It's a new theory that is explained in a very simple way.": 1,
    "If you have a desert on the continent,": 1,
    " and you have an ocean with you, the evaporation in the ocean is greater, it produces a suction and pulls the air over the desert.": 1,
    "The desert is trapped in this condition, it will always be dry.": 1,
    " If you have an inverse condition with the forest, the evaporation, as we showed, is much greater by the trees, and this relation is reversed.": 1,
    "So the air is pulled from above the ocean, and then you have...": 1,
    " The importation of humidity, this is an image that was taken a month ago, from Saterte, Manaus is down there, we are down there, that shows this process.": 1,
    "It's not a cute river of those that flow in a canal, but it's a powerful river.": 1,
    " that irrigates South America and has other purposes.": 1,
    "This image shows, in those trajectories there, all the hurricanes that we have registered.": 1,
    "And you see that in the red square there are almost no hurricanes.": 1,
    " This is not by chance.": 1,
    "This bomb that pulls moisture into the continent also accelerates the air over the ocean, and this prevents the organization of the hurricanes.": 1,
    " to end this part in a synthesis, I'd like to say something a little different.": 1,
    "I have several colleagues who have participated in the development of these theories,": 1,
    " which are of the opinion, including me, that we can recover planet Earth.": 1,
    "I'm not talking here only about the Amazon.": 1,
    " The Amazon gives us a lesson on how the pristine nature works.": 1,
    "We didn't understand these processes before, because the rest of the world is all detonated.": 1,
    " Here we can understand.": 1,
    "So, these colleagues say, we can, yes, recover other areas, including deserts.": 1,
    "If we can establish forests in these other areas, we can reverse the climate.": 1,
    " including global warming.": 1,
    "I have a very dear colleague in India, called Suprava Raseeshan, who has a motto.": 1,
    "Her motto in English is, gardening back the biosphere.": 1,
    " rejuvenating the biosphere.": 1,
    "It does a wonderful job of rebuilding ecosystems.": 1,
    "We need to do this.": 1,
    "To conclude this quick introduction,": 1,
    " We get to the reality that we are seeing here outside, which is drought, climate change, and things that we already knew.": 1,
    "And here I wanted to tell you a little story.": 1,
    " Once, four years ago, I heard a statement from a text by Davi Kopenawa, a wise representative of the Yanomami people.": 1,
    " that said more or less the following, does the white man not know that if he takes the forest, the rain will end?": 1,
    "And if the rain ends, will he not have what to drink or what to eat?": 1,
    " And I heard that, I cried, because I said, wow, I've been studying this for 20 years, a supercomputer, dozens, thousands of scientists, and we are beginning to reach this conclusion, and he already knows.": 1,
    " An aggravation?": 1,
    "The Yanomami never killed themselves.": 1,
    "How can they know the rain is over?": 1,
    " I kept this in my head and was completely shocked.": 1,
    "How could he know?": 1,
    "A few months later, I met him at another event and said, Davi, how did you know that if you remove the forest, the rain would end?": 1,
    " He said, the spirit of the forest told us.": 1,
    "And that, for me, was a game changer.": 1,
    "It was a total change, because I said, well, why am I doing all this?": 1,
    " all the science to get to the conclusion of what he already knows.": 1,
    "And then something absolutely critical struck me, which is": 1,
    " O que os olhos n\u00e3o veem, o cora\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o sente.": 1,
    " Out of sight, out of heart.": 1,
    " And this is a necessity that my predecessor put, that we need to see things.": 1,
    "We, when I say Western society, which is becoming global, civilized, we need to see.": 1,
    " If we don't see, we don't register.": 1,
    "We live in ignorance.": 1,
    "So I make the following proposal.": 1,
    "Of course the astronauts won't spend, but let's turn a hubble upside down.": 1,
    "And let's make the hubble look this way.": 1,
    " Not for the ends of the universe.": 1,
    "The wonderful ends of the universe.": 1,
    "But now we have a practical reality, which is that we live in an unknown cosmos.": 1,
    "We are ignorant.": 1,
    "We are tributing this wonderful cosmos.": 1,
    " that gives us housing and shelter and talks to astrophysics, the Earth is a statistical improbability.": 1,
    "The stability and comfort that we appreciate": 1,
    " With all the droughts of Rio Negro, with all the heat and cold, there is nothing like it in the universe, nothing known.": 1,
    "So, we'll come here, and we'll look...": 1,
    " Let's look at the Earth.": 1,
    "Let's start with the Amazon.": 1,
    "Let's dive.": 1,
    "Let's get to the reality we live in every day and look at it closely, since we need it.": 1,
    "Davi Kopenawa doesn't need it.": 1,
    " it already has something that I think I've lost.": 1,
    "I was educated by television, right?": 1,
    "I think I've lost this something, which is an ancestral record, which is an appreciation of what I don't know, what I haven't seen.": 1,
    " He doesn't need to give proof to Saint Thomas.": 1,
    "He believes with veneration and reverence in what the ancestors taught them and the spirits.": 1,
    "Since we can't do it, let's look at the forest.": 1,
    " But even when we're with Hubble looking at the sky, this is the bird's view, right?": 1,
    "Even when this happens, we see something that we also don't know.": 1,
    " The Spaniards called it the Green Hell.": 1,
    "If you go out here in this forest and get lost, and you happen to go west, you have 900 km to get to Colombia.": 1,
    " More than a thousand to go out somewhere, so you can understand why they called it Green Hell.": 1,
    "But look at what's in there.": 1,
    " It's a living carpet.": 1,
    "Each color there is a kind of tree.": 1,
    "Each tree, each cup, has...": 1,
    " 10,000 species of insects inside it.": 1,
    "Not to mention the millions of species of fungi, bacteria, etc.": 1,
    "All invisible.": 1,
    " Everything is a cosmos, stranger to us than the distant galaxies, billions of years from Earth, that Hubble brings us every day in the newspapers.": 1,
    " And I close my presentation, I only have a few seconds, showing this wonderful being, and when we see the morphobite in the forest, we have the feeling that someone has forgotten the door of paradise open and this creature has escaped from there.": 1,
    " Because it's very beautiful.": 1,
    "But I can't stop ending without showing a technological side.": 1,
    "We have the arrogance of technology.": 1,
    " We dispossess the nature of your technology.": 1,
    "A robotic hand is technological, my hand is biological.": 1,
    "And we don't think about it anymore.": 1,
    "So, let's look at the morphing bubble.": 1,
    " which is an example of an invisible technological competence of life, which is at the height of our possibility of survival on the planet.": 1,
    " And let's zoom in on it again.": 1,
    "Let's go into Borboleta's wing.": 1,
    "And these students tried to explain why it's blue.": 1,
    "And let's zoom in.": 1,
    "And what you see is that the architecture of the invisible": 1,
    " humiliates the best architects in the world.": 1,
    "All of this on a very small scale.": 1,
    "In addition to beauty and functioning, there is another aspect, everything that is": 1,
    " in the organized nature, in extraordinary structures, has a function.": 1,
    "And this function of the butterfly, Morpho,": 1,
    " It means that it is not blue, there is no blue pigment in it.": 1,
    "It has photonic crystals on the surface.": 1,
    "According to those who studied this, extremely...": 1,
    " sophisticated, nothing like what our technology still had at the time.": 1,
    "Now, Itacho has already made a monitor display that uses this technology, and it's used in fiber optics for transmission of... Janine Benius, who has already come here several times and talks about this, bio-mimetic.": 1,
    " And my time is up, so I will conclude with what is at the base of this capacity, of this biodiversity competence to produce all those wonderful services, the living cell.": 1,
    " It's a structure of some microns, which is an internal wonder.": 1,
    "There are lectures in TED about this, I won't extend myself, but each one in this room...": 1,
    " Including me.": 1,
    "There are 100 trillion of this micro-machine in your body so that you can appreciate this well-being.": 1,
    "Imagine what's in an Amazon forest.": 1,
    "100 trillion.": 1,
    "That's more than the number of stars in the sky.": 1,
    " and we are not aware of it.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
