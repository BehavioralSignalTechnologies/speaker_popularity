    " I'm Jessie, and this is my suitcase.": 1,
    "But before I show you what I've got inside, I'm going to make a very public confession, and that is I'm outfit obsessed.": 1,
    " I love finding, wearing, and more recently, photographing and blogging a different colorful crazy outfit for every single occasion.": 1,
    " but I don't buy anything new.": 1,
    "I get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores.": 1,
    "Oh, thank you!": 1,
    " Secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet.": 1,
    "I get to meet all kinds of great people.": 1,
    "My dollars usually go to a good cause.": 1,
    "I look pretty unique.": 1,
    " And it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt.": 1,
    "I mean, what am I going to find today?": 1,
    "Is it going to be my size?": 1,
    "Will I like the color?": 1,
    "Will it be under $20?": 1,
    "If all the answers are yes,": 1,
    " I feel as though I've won.": 1,
    " I want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED.": 1,
    "I mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her?": 1,
    "So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.": 1,
    " I brought seven pairs of underpants.": 1,
    "And that's it.": 1,
    " Exactly one week's worth of undies is all I put in my suitcase.": 1,
    "I was betting that I'd be able to find everything else I could possibly want to wear once I got here to Palm Springs.": 1,
    " And since you don't know me as the woman walking around Ted in her underwear,": 1,
    " That means I found a few things and I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now.": 1,
    "Does that sound good?": 1,
    " So as I do this, I'm also gonna tell you a few of the life lessons that believe it or not, I have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new.": 1,
    "So let's start with Sunday.": 1,
    " I call this shiny tiger.": 1,
    "You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great.": 1,
    "You can almost always look phenomenal for under $50.": 1,
    "This whole outfit, including the jacket,": 1,
    " cost me 55 and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week.": 1,
    "Monday, color is powerful.": 1,
    "It is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants.": 1,
    " If you are happy, you are gonna attract other happy people to you.": 1,
    " Tuesday, fitting in is way overrated.": 1,
    "I spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in.": 1,
    " Just be who you are.": 1,
    "If you are surrounding yourself with the right people, they will not only get it, they will appreciate it.": 1,
    " Wednesday, embrace your inner child.": 1,
    "Sometimes people tell me that I look like I'm playing dress up or that I remind them of their seven year old.": 1,
    "I like to smile and say thank you.": 1,
    " Thursday, confidence is key.": 1,
    "If you think you look good in something, you almost certainly do.": 1,
    "And if you don't think you look good in something, you're also probably right.": 1,
    " I grew up with a mom who taught me this day in and day out.": 1,
    "But it wasn't until I turned 30 that I really got what this meant.": 1,
    "And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second.": 1,
    " If you believe you're a beautiful person inside and out, there is no look that you can't pull off.": 1,
    "So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience.": 1,
    "We should be able to rock anything we want to rock.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " Friday, a universal truth, five words for you.": 1,
    "Gold sequins go with everything.": 1,
    " And finally, Saturday.": 1,
    " Developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.": 1,
    "It's been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I'm wearing and we've had great conversations.": 1,
    " So obviously this is not all gonna fit back in my tiny suitcase.": 1,
    "So before I go home to Brooklyn, I'm gonna donate everything back because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week is that it's okay to let go.": 1,
    " I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner there is always going to be another crazy, colorful, shiny outfit just waiting for me if I put a little love in my heart and look.": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1
