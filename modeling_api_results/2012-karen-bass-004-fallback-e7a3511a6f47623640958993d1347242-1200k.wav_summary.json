    " I'm a very lucky person.": 1,
    "I've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful earth and the people and creatures that live on it.": 1,
    " And my passion was inspired at the age of seven when my parents first took me to Morocco at the edge of the Sahara Desert.": 1,
    " Now imagine, a little Brit, somewhere that wasn't cold and damp like home.": 1,
    "What an amazing experience.": 1,
    "And it made me want to explore more.": 1,
    " So, as a filmmaker, I've been from one end of the earth to the other trying to get the perfect shot.": 1,
    " and to capture animal behaviour never seen before.": 1,
    "And what's more, I'm really lucky because I get to share that with millions of people worldwide.": 1,
    " Now, the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step.": 1,
    " You might think that it's quite hard to find new stories and new subjects, but new technology is changing the way we can film.": 1,
    " It's enabling us to get fresh new images and tell brand new stories.": 1,
    " In Nature's Great Events, a series for the BBC that I did with David Attenborough, we wanted to do just that.": 1,
    " Images of grizzly bears are pretty familiar.": 1,
    "You see them all the time, you think, but there's a whole side to their lives that we hardly ever see and it had never been filmed.": 1,
    " So, what we did, we went to Alaska, which is where the Grizzlies rely on really high, almost inaccessible mountain slopes for their denning.": 1,
    " And the only way to film that is a shoot from the air.": 1,
    " Throughout Alaska and British Columbia, thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep.": 1,
    " There is nothing to eat up here, but the conditions were ideal for hibernation.": 1,
    " Lots of snow in which to dig a den.": 1,
    " To find food, mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast where the snow will already be melting.": 1,
    " But getting down can be a challenge for small cubs.": 1,
    " Oh.": 1,
    " These mountains are dangerous places.": 1,
    "But ultimately, the fate of these bear families, and indeed that of all bears around the North Pacific, depends on the salmon.": 1,
    " I love that shot.": 1,
    "I always get goosebumps every time I see it.": 1,
    "That was filmed from a helicopter using a gyro-stabilised camera.": 1,
    " and it's a wonderful bit of gear because it's like having a flying tripod crane and dolly all rolled into one.": 1,
    "But technology alone isn't enough.": 1,
    " To really get the money shots, it's down to being in the right place at the right time.": 1,
    "And that sequence was especially difficult.": 1,
    "The first year, we got nothing.": 1,
    " We had to go back the following year, all the way back to the remote parts of Alaska, and we hung around with the helicopter for two whole weeks.": 1,
    " And eventually, we got lucky.": 1,
    "The cloud lifted, the wind was still, and even the bears showed up, and we managed to get that magic moment.": 1,
    " For a filmmaker, new technology is an amazing tool.": 1,
    "But the other thing that really, really excites me is when new species are discovered.": 1,
    " Now, when I heard about one animal, I knew we had to get it for my next series, Untamed America for National Geographic.": 1,
    " In 2005, a new species of bat was discovered in the cloud forest of Ecuador.": 1,
    "And what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the mystery": 1,
    " of what pollinated a unique flower.": 1,
    "It depends solely on the bat.": 1,
    "Now, the series hasn't even aired yet, so you're the very first to see this.": 1,
    "See what you think.": 1,
    " the tube lift nectar bat.": 1,
    " A pool of delicious nectar lies at the bottom of each flower's long flute.": 1,
    " but how to reach it.": 1,
    " Necessity is the mother of evolution.": 1,
    " Okay.": 1,
    " This 2 and 1 half inch bat has a 3 and 1 half inch tongue.": 1,
    " the longest relative to body length of any mammal in the world.": 1,
    "If human, he'd have a nine-foot tongue.": 1,
    " We filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower and using a camera that could slow the action by 40 times.": 1,
    "So imagine how quick that thing is in real life.": 1,
    " Now, people often ask me, where's your favorite place on the planet?": 1,
    "And the truth is, I just don't have one.": 1,
    "There are so many wonderful places.": 1,
    " But some locations draw you back time and time again.": 1,
    "And one remote location.": 1,
    "I first went there as a backpacker.": 1,
    "I've been back several times for filming, most recently for Untamed Americas.": 1,
    " It's the Altiplano in the high Andes of South America, and it's the most otherworldly place I know.": 1,
    "But at 15,000 feet, it's tough.": 1,
    "It's freezing cold.": 1,
    " And that thin air really gets you.": 1,
    "Sometimes it's hard to breathe, especially carrying all the heavy filming equipment.": 1,
    " And that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover.": 1,
    " But the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens with amazing clarity.": 1,
    "Have a look.": 1,
    " Some 1500 miles south of the tropics, between Chile and Bolivia, the Andes completely change.": 1,
    " It's called the Altiplano, or high plains.": 1,
    " A place of extremes.": 1,
    " the extreme contrasts.": 1,
    " where deserts freeze.": 1,
    " waters boil.": 1,
    " More like Mars than Earth.": 1,
    "It seems just as hostile to life.": 1,
    " The stars themselves.": 1,
    " At 12,000 feet, the dry, thin air makes for perfect stargazing.": 1,
    " Some of the world's astronomers have telescopes nearby.": 1,
    " but just looking up with the naked eye.": 1,
    " You really don't need me.": 1,
    " Thank you so much for letting me share some images of our magnificent, wonderful Earth.": 1,
    "Thank you for letting me share that with you.": 1
