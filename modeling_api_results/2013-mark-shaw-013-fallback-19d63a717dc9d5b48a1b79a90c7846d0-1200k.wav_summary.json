    " I'm here to show you how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at.": 1,
    "You're about to experience a new available and exciting technology that's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives.": 1,
    " What I have here is a cinder block that we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material.": 1,
    "It's called Ultra Everdry.": 1,
    " And when you apply it to any material, it turns into a super hydrophobic shield.": 1,
    "So this is a cinder block, uncoated.": 1,
    "And you can see that it's porous, absorbs water.": 1,
    "Not anymore.": 1,
    " Porous, non-porous.": 1,
    " So what's super hydrophobic?": 1,
    " Super hydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface.": 1,
    "The rounder it is, the more hydrophobic it is.": 1,
    "And if it's really round, it's super hydrophobic.": 1,
    "A freshly waxed car, the water molecules slump to about 90 degrees.": 1,
    " Windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees, but what you're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees, and anything over 150 is super hydrophobic.": 1,
    " So as part of the demonstration, what I have is a pair of gloves.": 1,
    "And we've coated one of the gloves.": 1,
    " with the nanotechnology coding.": 1,
    "And let's see if you can tell which one and I'll give you a hint.": 1,
    " Did you guess the one that was dry?": 1,
    " When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience, what's occurred is that we're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits.": 1,
    " And we're talking really small here.": 1,
    "The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers.": 1,
    "And one nanometer is a billionth of a meter.": 1,
    "And to put some scale to that, if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick,": 1,
    " and you put it side by side, and you had 50,000 of them, you'd be the width of a human hair.": 1,
    "So very small, but very useful.": 1,
    " And it's not just water that this works with.": 1,
    "It's a lot of water-based materials like concrete, water-based paint, mud, and also some refined oils as well.": 1,
    " You can see the difference.": 1,
    " Moving on to the next demonstration, we've taken a painted glass and we've coated the outside of it, we've framed it with the nanotechnology coating.": 1,
    " And we're going to pour this green-painted water inside the middle.": 1,
    "And you're going to see it's going to spread out on glass like you'd normally think it would, except when it hits the coating, it stops.": 1,
    "And I can't even coax it to leave.": 1,
    " It's that afraid of the water.": 1,
    " So what's going on here?": 1,
    "What's happening?": 1,
    "Well, the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface.": 1,
    "You'd think it'd be smooth, but it's actually not.": 1,
    "And it has billions of interstitial spaces.": 1,
    " And those spaces, along with the nanoparticles, reach up and grab the air molecules and cover the surface with air.": 1,
    "It's an umbrella of air all across it.": 1,
    " And that layer of air is what the water hits, the mud hits, the concrete hits, and it glides right off.": 1,
    "So if I put this inside this water here, you can see a silver reflective coating around it.": 1,
    " And that silver coating is the layer of air that's protecting the water from touching the paddle, and it's dry.": 1,
    " So what are the applications?": 1,
    " I mean, many of you right now are probably going through your head.": 1,
    "Everyone that sees this gets excited and says, oh, I could use it for this and this and this.": 1,
    "The applications, in a general sense, could be anything that's anti-wedding.": 1,
    "We've certainly seen that today.": 1,
    " It could be anything that's anti-icing, because if you don't have water, you don't have ice.": 1,
    "It could be anti-corrosion.": 1,
    "No water, no corrosion.": 1,
    "It could be antibacterial.": 1,
    " Without water, the bacteria won't survive.": 1,
    "And it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well.": 1,
    " So imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work.": 1,
    " And I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration.": 1,
    "But before I do that, I would like to say thank you and think small.": 1,
    " It's gonna happen.": 1,
    " Wait for it.": 1,
    "Wait for it.": 1,
    "You guys didn't hear about us cutting out the design from Ted?": 1,
    " He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part.": 1,
    "It's happening!": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1
