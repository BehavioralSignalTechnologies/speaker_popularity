    " Hi, my name is Cameron Russell.": 1,
    "And for the last little while, I've been a model, actually for 10 years.": 1,
    " And I feel like there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress.": 1,
    " So luckily, I brought an outfit change.": 1,
    "This is the first outfit change on the TED stage.": 1,
    "So you guys are pretty lucky to witness it, I think.": 1,
    " If some of the women were really horrified when I came out, you don't have to tell me now, but I'll find out later on Twitter.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " I'd also note that I'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds.": 1,
    "Not everybody gets to do that.": 1,
    " These heels are very uncomfortable, so good thing I wasn't going to wear them.": 1,
    " The worst part is putting this sweater over my head because that's when you'll laugh at me.": 1,
    "So don't do anything while it's over my head.": 1,
    " All right.": 1,
    " So, why did I do that?": 1,
    "That was awkward.": 1,
    "Well...": 1,
    " Hopefully not as awkward as that picture.": 1,
    "Image is powerful, but also image is superficial.": 1,
    " I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds.": 1,
    " And in this picture, I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life.": 1,
    "I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy's hair.": 1,
    " And of course, barring surgery or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform how we look.": 1,
    "And how we look, though it is superficial and immutable, has a huge impact on our lives.": 1,
    " So today, for me, being fearless means being honest.": 1,
    "And I am on this stage because I am a model.": 1,
    " I'm on this stage because I'm a pretty white woman.": 1,
    "In my industry, we call that a sexy girl.": 1,
    "And I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but with an honest twist.": 1,
    " So the first question is, how do you become a model?": 1,
    "And I always just say, oh, I was scouted, but that means nothing.": 1,
    "The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery and I am the recipient of a legacy.": 1,
    "And maybe you're wondering what is a legacy.": 1,
    "Well,": 1,
    " For the past few centuries, we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that were biologically programmed to admire,": 1,
    " but also as tall, slender figures and femininity and white skin.": 1,
    "And this is a legacy that was built for me and it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on.": 1,
    "And I know there are people in the audience who are": 1,
    " skeptical at this point.": 1,
    "And maybe there are some fashionistas who are like, wait, Naomi, Tyra, Joan Smalls, Lu Wen.": 1,
    "And first, I commend you on your model knowledge.": 1,
    "Very impressive.": 1,
    " But unfortunately, I have to inform you that in 2007, a very inspired NYU PhD student counted": 1,
    " All the models on the runway, every single one was hired, and of the 677 models that were hired, only 27 were less than 4% were non-white.": 1,
    " The next question people always ask me is, can I be a model when I grow up?": 1,
    "And the first answer is, I don't know, they don't put me in charge of that.": 1,
    " But the second answer, and what I really want to say to these little girls, is why?": 1,
    "You know, you can be anything.": 1,
    "You could be the president of the United States or the inventor of the next internet or...": 1,
    " a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet, which would be awesome because he'd be the first one.": 1,
    "If after this amazing list, they still are like, no, no, Cameron, I want to be a model.": 1,
    "Well, then I say, be my boss.": 1,
    " because I'm not in charge of anything and you could be the editor-in-chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H&M or the next Stephen Maizel.": 1,
    " Saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up.": 1,
    " It's out of your control and it's awesome and it's not a career path.": 1,
    "I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons, it can just be distilled right into right now.": 1,
    " If the photographer is right there, and the light is right there like a nice HMI, and the client says, Cameron, we want a walking shot.": 1,
    "Well, then this light goes first, nice and long, this arm goes back, this arm goes forward, the head is at three quarters, and you just go back and forth.": 1,
    "Just do that.": 1,
    "And then you look back at your imaginary friends.": 1,
    " 300, 400, 500 times.": 1,
    "It will look something like this.": 1,
    " Hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle.": 1,
    "I don't know what happened there.": 1,
    "Unfortunately, after you've gone to school and you have a resume and you've done a few jobs, you can't say anything anymore.": 1,
    " If you say you want to be the president of the United States, but your resume reads underwear model 10 years, people give you a funny look.": 1,
    "The next question people always ask me is, do they retouch all the photos?": 1,
    "And yeah, they pretty much retouch all the photos, but that is only a small component of what's happening.": 1,
    " This picture is the very first picture that I ever took, and it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini.": 1,
    "And I didn't even have my period yet.": 1,
    "I know we're getting personal, but I was a young girl.": 1,
    "This is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier.": 1,
    " Here's me on the same day as this shoot my friend got to come with me.": 1,
    "Here's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue.": 1,
    "Here's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine.": 1,
    " And here's me today.": 1,
    "And I hope what you're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me, they are constructions.": 1,
    " They are constructions by professionals, by hairstylists, and makeup artists, and photographers, and stylists, and all of their assistants, and pre-production, and post-production.": 1,
    "And they build this.": 1,
    "That's not me.": 1,
    " Okay, so the next question people always ask me is, do you get free stuff?": 1,
    "I do have too many 8-inch heels, which I never get to wear, except for earlier.": 1,
    "But the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life, and that's what we don't like to talk about.": 1,
    " I grew up in Cambridge and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free.": 1,
    "When I was a teenager I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course we got pulled over.": 1,
    " And all it took was a sorry officer and we were on our way.": 1,
    "And I got these free things because of how I look, not who I am.": 1,
    "And there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are.": 1,
    "I live in New York.": 1,
    " And last year, of the 140,000 teenagers that were stop and frisked, 86% of them were black and Latino, and most of them were young men.": 1,
    " And there are only 177,000 young black and Latino men in New York.": 1,
    "So for them, it's not a question of will I get stopped, but how many times will I get stopped?": 1,
    "When will I get stopped?": 1,
    " When I was researching this talk, I found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the United States, 53% don't like their bodies.": 1,
    "And that number goes to 78% by the time that they're 17.": 1,
    " So the last question people ask me is, what is it like to be a model?": 1,
    "And I think the answer that they're looking for is,": 1,
    " If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair, you will be so happy and fabulous.": 1,
    "And when we're backstage, we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that.": 1,
    "We say,": 1,
    " It's really amazing to travel and it's amazing to get to work with creative, inspired, passionate people.": 1,
    "And those things are true, but they're only one half of the story because the thing that we never say on camera, that I have never said on camera,": 1,
    " is I am insecure.": 1,
    " And I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day.": 1,
    " And if you ever are wondering, you know, if I have thinner thighs and shinier hair, will I be happier?": 1,
    "You just need to meet a group of models because they have the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes, and they're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet.": 1,
    " So when I was writing this talk, I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance because on the one hand, I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say, look, I've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor.": 1,
    " and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with, and it doesn't always make me happy.": 1,
    "But mostly, it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I'm one of the biggest beneficiaries.": 1,
    " But I'm also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it's great I got to come, you know, before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job.": 1,
    " Or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college, which seems so important right now.": 1,
    " If there's a takeaway to this talk, I hope it's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
