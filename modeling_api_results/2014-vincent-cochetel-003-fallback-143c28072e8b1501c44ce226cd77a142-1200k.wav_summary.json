    " I cannot forget them.": 2,
    " Their names were Aslan, Alik, Andre, Fernanda, Fred, Galina, Gunil, Hans, Ingeborg, Mati, Natalia,": 1,
    " Nancy, Cheryl, Usman, Zarema and the list is longer.": 1,
    " For many, their existence, their humanity has been reduced to statistics, coldly recorded as security incidents.": 1,
    " For me, they were colleagues belonging to that community of humanitarian aid workers that tried to bring a bit of comfort to the victims of the wars in Chechnya in the 90s.": 1,
    " They were nurses, logisticians, shelter experts, paralegals, interpreters.": 1,
    " and for this service they were murdered.": 1,
    " their family torn apart, and their story largely forgotten.": 1,
    " No one was ever sentenced for these crimes.": 1,
    "They live in me somehow.": 1,
    "Their memories giving me meaning every day.": 1,
    "But they are also haunting the dark street of my mind.": 1,
    " As humanitarian aid workers, they made the choice to be at the side of the victim, to provide some assistance, some comfort, some protection.": 1,
    "But when they needed protection themselves, it wasn't there.": 1,
    " And you see the headlines of your newspaper these days with the war in Iraq or in Syria, head worker abducted or stage executed.": 1,
    " But where were they?": 1,
    " Why were they there?": 1,
    "What motivated them?": 1,
    "How did we become so indifferent to these crimes?": 1,
    " This is why I'm here today with you.": 1,
    " We need to find better ways to remember them.": 1,
    " We also need to explain the key values to which they dedicated their life.": 1,
    "We also need to demand for justice.": 1,
    " When in 96 I was sent by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to the North Caucasus, I knew some of the risks.": 1,
    " Five colleagues had been killed.": 1,
    "Three had been seriously injured.": 1,
    "Seven had already been taken off stage.": 1,
    "So we were careful.": 1,
    " We were using armored vehicles, decoy cars, changing patterns of traveling, changing homes, all sorts of security measures.": 1,
    " Yet, on a cold winter night of January 98, it was my turn.": 1,
    " When I entered my flat in Vladikavkaz with a guard, we were surrounded by armed men.": 1,
    " They took the guard, they put him on the floor, they beat him up in front of him, tied him, dragged him away.": 1,
    " I was uncuffed, blindfolded, and forced to kneel with the silencer of a gun pressed against my neck.": 1,
    "When it happens to you, there is no time for thinking, no time for praying.": 1,
    " My brain went on automatic, rewinding quickly the life I just left behind.": 1,
    " It took me long minutes to figure out that those masked men there were not there to kill me, but that someone somewhere had ordered my kidnapping.": 1,
    " Then a process of dehumanization started that day.": 1,
    "I was no more than just a commodity.": 1,
    " I normally don't talk about this, but I'd like to share a bit with you some of those 317 days of captivity.": 1,
    "I was kept in an underground cellar.": 1,
    "Total darkness.": 1,
    " for 23 hours and 45 minutes every day.": 1,
    "And then the guards would come.": 1,
    "Normally, too, they would bring a big piece of bread, a bowl of soup, and a candle.": 1,
    " That candle would burn for 15 minutes.": 1,
    " 15 minutes of precious light.": 1,
    " And then they would take it away.": 1,
    "And I returned to darkness.": 1,
    " I was chained by a metal cable to my bed.": 1,
    "I could do only four small steps.": 1,
    " I always dreamt of the fifth one.": 1,
    " I had no TV, no radio, no newspaper, no one to talk to.": 1,
    "I had no toilet, no soap, no toilet paper, just two metal buckets open, one for water, one for waste.": 1,
    " Can you imagine that mock execution can be a pastime for guards when they are sadistic or when they're just bored or drunk?": 1,
    " We are breaking my nerves very slowly.": 1,
    " Isolation and darkness are particularly difficult to describe.": 1,
    "How you describe nothing.": 1,
    " There are no words for the depths of loneliness I reach in that very thin border between sanity and madness.": 1,
    " In the darkness, sometimes I played an imaginary game of checker.": 1,
    "I would start with the black, play with the white, back to the black, trying to trick the other side.": 1,
    " I don't play checkers anymore.": 1,
    " I was tormented by the thoughts of my family and my colleague, the guard, Edik.": 1,
    "I didn't know what had happened to him.": 1,
    " was trying not to think.": 1,
    "I tried to fill up my time by doing all sorts of physical exercise on the spot.": 1,
    "I tried to pray.": 1,
    "I tried all sorts of memorization game.": 1,
    " But darkness also creates images and thoughts that are not normal.": 1,
    "One part of your brain wants you to resist, to shout, to cry.": 1,
    " and the other part of the brain orders you to shut up and just go through it.": 1,
    " And it's a constant internal debate.": 1,
    "There is no one to arbitrate.": 1,
    " Once a God came to me very aggressively and he told me, today you're gonna kneel and beg for your food.": 1,
    " I wasn't in a good mood, so I insulted him.": 1,
    "I insulted his mother, I insulted his ancestor.": 1,
    " The consequence was moderate.": 1,
    "He threw the food into my waist.": 1,
    "The day after, he came back with the same demand.": 1,
    " He got the same answer.": 1,
    " which had the same consequence.": 1,
    " Four days later, the body was full of pain.": 1,
    "I didn't know anger hurts so much when you have so little.": 1,
    " So, when the gods came down,": 1,
    " I nailed.": 1,
    " I beg for my food.": 1,
    " Submission was the only way for me to make it to another candle.": 1,
    " After my kidnapping, I was transferred from North Ossetia to Chechnya.": 1,
    "Three days of slow travel in the trunks of different cars.": 1,
    "Upon arrival, I was interrogated for 11 days by a guy called Ruslan.": 1,
    " The routine was always the same, a bit more light, 45 minutes.": 1,
    "He would come down to the cellar, he would ask the guards to tie me on the chair, and he would turn on the music loud.": 1,
    " And then he would yell questions.": 1,
    "He would scream.": 1,
    "He would beat me.": 1,
    "I'll spare you the details.": 1,
    "There are many questions I could not understand, and there are some questions I did not want to understand.": 1,
    " The length of the interrogation was the duration of the tape.": 1,
    "15 songs, 45 minutes.": 1,
    "I would always long for the last song.": 1,
    " On one day, one night in that cellar, I don't know what it was, I heard a child crying above my head.": 1,
    "A boy, maybe two, three years old.": 1,
    "Footsteps, confusion, people running.": 1,
    " So when Ruslan came the day after, and before he put the first question to me, I asked him, how is your son today?": 1,
    "Is he feeling better?": 1,
    "Ruslan was taken by surprise.": 1,
    " He was furious that the guards may have leaked some details about his private life.": 1,
    " I kept talking about NGOs supplying medicines to local clinics that may help his son to get better.": 1,
    "And we talk about education, we talk about families.": 1,
    " He talked to me about his children.": 1,
    "I talked to him about my daughters.": 1,
    "And then he talked about guns, about cars, about women.": 1,
    "And I had to talk about guns, about cars, and about women.": 1,
    " and we talk until the last song on the tape.": 1,
    " Ruslan was the most brutal man I ever met.": 1,
    " He did not touch me anymore.": 1,
    "He did not ask any other question.": 1,
    "I was no longer just a commodity.": 1,
    " Two days later I was transferred, two days after I was transferred to another place.": 1,
    "There a guard came to me, very close, it's quite unusual.": 1,
    "And he said with a very soft voice, he said,": 1,
    " I'd like to thank you for the assistance your organization provided my family when we were displaced in nearby Dagestan.": 1,
    " What could I possibly reply?": 1,
    " It was so painful.": 1,
    "It was like a blade in the belly.": 1,
    " It took me weeks of internal thinking to try to reconcile the good reasons we had to assist that family, and the soldier of fortune he became.": 1,
    "He was young, he was shy, I never saw his face.": 1,
    " He probably meant well.": 1,
    " But in those 15 seconds, he made me question everything we did, all the sacrifices.": 1,
    " It made me think also how they see us.": 1,
    "Until then, I had assumed that they know why we are there and what we are doing.": 1,
    " One cannot assume this.": 1,
    " Well, explaining why we do this is not that easy, even to our closest relatives.": 1,
    " We are not perfect.": 1,
    "We are not superior.": 1,
    "We are not the world's fire brigade.": 1,
    "We are not superheroes.": 1,
    "We don't stop wars.": 1,
    " We know that humanitarian response are not substitute for political solution.": 1,
    " Yet we do this because one life matters.": 1,
    "Sometimes that's the only difference you make.": 1,
    "One individual, one family, a small group of individuals.": 1,
    "And it matters.": 1,
    " When you have a tsunami, an earthquake, or a typhoon, you see teams of rescuers coming from all over the world, searching for survivors for weeks.": 1,
    "Why?": 1,
    "Nobody questions this.": 1,
    "Every life matters.": 1,
    " or every life should matter.": 1,
    " This is the same for us when we help refugees, people displaced within their country by conflict or stateless person.": 1,
    " I know many people when they are confronted to overwhelming suffering, they feel powerless and they stop there.": 1,
    "It's a pity because there are so many ways people can help.": 1,
    " We don't stop with that feeling.": 1,
    "We try to do whatever we can to provide some assistance, some protection, some comfort.": 1,
    " We have to.": 1,
    "We can't do otherwise.": 1,
    "It's what makes us feel, I don't know, simply human.": 1,
    " That's a picture of me the day of my release.": 1,
    "Months after my release, I met the then French prime minister.": 1,
    " The second thing he told me, you were totally irresponsible to go to the North Caucasus.": 1,
    "You don't know how many problems you've created for us.": 1,
    " was a short meeting.": 1,
    " I think helping people in danger is responsible.": 1,
    " in that war that nobody seriously wanted to stop.": 1,
    "And we have many of these today.": 1,
    " Bringing some assistance to people in need and a bit of protection was not just an act of humanity, it was making a real difference for the people.": 1,
    "Why you could not understand this?": 1,
    " We have a responsibility to try.": 1,
    "You've heard about that concept, responsibility to protect.": 1,
    " Outcomes may depend on various parameters.": 1,
    "We may even fail, but it is worse than failing.": 1,
    "It's not even trying when we can.": 1,
    " Well, if you are made this way, if you sign up for this sort of job, your life is going to be full of joy and sadness.": 1,
    "Because there are a lot of people we cannot help.": 1,
    " A lot of people we cannot protect, a lot of people we did not save.": 1,
    "I call them my ghosts.": 1,
    "And by having witnessed their suffering from close, you take a bit of that suffering on yourself.": 1,
    " Many young humanitarian workers go through their first experience with a lot of bitterness.": 1,
    "They're thrown into situations where they are weakness, but they are powerless to bring any change.": 1,
    "They have to learn to accept it.": 1,
    " and gradually turn this into positive energy.": 1,
    "It's difficult.": 1,
    "Many don't succeed.": 1,
    " But for those who do, there is no other job like this.": 1,
    "You can see the difference you make every day.": 1,
    " Humanitarian aid workers know the risk they are taking in conflict areas or in post-conflict environments.": 1,
    "Yet,": 1,
    " Our life, our job is becoming increasingly life-threatening, and the sanctity of our life is fading.": 1,
    " Do you know that since the millennium, the number of attacks on humanitarian aid workers has tripled?": 1,
    " 2013 broke new records, 155 colleagues killed, 171 seriously wounded, 134 abducted.": 1,
    " So many broken lives.": 1,
    " until the beginning of the civil war in Somalia in the late 80s.": 1,
    " Humanitarian aid workers were sometimes victims of what we call collateral damages, but by and large we were not the target of this attack.": 1,
    "This has changed.": 1,
    " Look at this picture, Baghdad, August 2003.": 1,
    "24 colleagues were killed, gone are the days where UN blue flag or red cross would automatically protect us.": 1,
    " Criminal groups and some political groups have cross-fertilized over the last 20 years, and they've created this sort of hybrids with whom we have no way of communicating.": 1,
    " Humanitarian principles are tested, questions are often ignored.": 1,
    " But perhaps more importantly, we have abandoned the search for justice.": 1,
    "There seems to be no consequence whatsoever for attacks against humanitarian aid workers.": 1,
    " After my release, I was told not to seek for any form of justice.": 1,
    "He won't do any good to you.": 1,
    "That's what I was told.": 1,
    "Plus, you're going to put in danger the life of other colleagues.": 1,
    " It took me years to see the sentencing of three people associated to my kidnapping.": 1,
    " But this was the exception.": 1,
    "There was no justice for any of the humanitarian aid workers killed or abducted in Chechnya between 95 and 99.": 1,
    "And it's the same all over the world.": 1,
    " This is unacceptable.": 1,
    "This is inexcusable.": 1,
    "Attacks on humanitarian aid workers are war crime in international law.": 1,
    "Those crimes should not go unpunished.": 1,
    " We must end this cycle of impunity.": 1,
    "We must consider that those attacks against humanitarian aid workers are attacks against humanity itself.": 1,
    " That makes me furious.": 1,
    " I know I'm very lucky compared to the refugees I work for.": 1,
    " I don't know what it is to have seen my old town destroyed.": 1,
    "I don't know what it is to have seen my relatives shot in front of me.": 1,
    "I don't know what it is to lose the protection of my country.": 1,
    " I also know that I'm very lucky compared to other hostages.": 1,
    "Four days before my eventful release, four hostages were beheaded a few miles away from where I was kept in captivity.": 1,
    "Why them?": 1,
    " Why am I here today?": 1,
    " No easy answer.": 1,
    " I was received with a lot of support that I got from my relatives, from colleagues, from friends, from people I didn't know.": 1,
    "They have helped me over years to come out of the darkness.": 1,
    " Not everyone was treated with the same attention.": 1,
    " How many of my colleagues after a traumatic incident took on their own life?": 1,
    " I can't count nine that I knew personally.": 1,
    " How many of my colleagues went through a difficult divorce after a traumatic experience?": 1,
    " because they could not explain anything anymore to their spouse.": 1,
    "I've lost that count.": 1,
    " There is a price for this type of life.": 1,
    " In Russia, all war monuments have this beautiful inscription at the top.": 1,
    "No one is forgotten.": 1,
    "Nothing is forgotten.": 1,
    " I do not forget my lost colleague.": 1,
    "I cannot forget anything.": 1,
    " I call on you to remember their dedication and demand that humanitarian aid workers around the world be better protected.": 1,
    " We should not let that light of hope they have brought to be switched off.": 1,
    " After my ordeal, a lot of colleagues ask me, but why do you continue?": 1,
    "Why do you do this sort of job?": 1,
    "Why do you have to go back to it?": 1,
    " My answer was very simple.": 1,
    " if I had quit.": 1,
    " That would have meant my kidnapper had won.": 1,
    " they would have taken my soul and my humanity.": 1
