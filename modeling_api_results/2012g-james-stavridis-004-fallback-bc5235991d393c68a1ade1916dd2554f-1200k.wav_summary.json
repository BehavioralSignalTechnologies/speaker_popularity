    " Thank you.": 2,
    " I'm going to talk a little bit about open source security because we've got to get better at security in this 21st century.": 1,
    " Let me start by saying let's look back to the 20th century and kind of get a sense of how that style of security worked for us.": 1,
    " This is Verdun, a battlefield in France, just north of the NATO headquarters in Belgium.": 1,
    "At Verdun in 1916,": 1,
    " Over a 300-day period, 700,000 people were killed.": 1,
    "It's about 2,000 a day.": 1,
    " If you roll it forward, 20th century security, into the Second World War, you see the Battle of Stalingrad, 300 days, 2 million people killed.": 1,
    " We go into the Cold War and we continue to try and build walls.": 1,
    "We go from the trench warfare": 1,
    " of the First World War to the Maginot Line of the Second World War, and then we go into the Cold War, the Iron Curtain, the Berlin Wall.": 1,
    "Walls don't work.": 1,
    " My thesis for us today is instead of building walls to create security, we need to build bridges.": 1,
    " This is a famous bridge in Europe.": 1,
    "It's in Bosnia-Herzegovina.": 1,
    "It's the bridge over the Drina River, subject of a novel by Ivo Andric.": 1,
    " And it talks about how in that very troubled part of Europe and the Balkans, over time there's been enormous building of walls.": 1,
    " More recently in the last decade, we begin to see these communities start hesitatingly to come together.": 1,
    "I would argue again,": 1,
    " Open source security is about connecting the international, the inner agency, the private public, and lashing it together with strategic communication, largely in social networks.": 1,
    " So let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that, because our global commons is under attack in a variety of ways.": 1,
    " And none of the sources of threat to the global commons will be solved by building walls.": 1,
    "Now, I'm a sailor, obviously.": 1,
    "This is a ship, a liner, clipping through the Indian Ocean.": 1,
    " What's wrong with this picture?": 1,
    "It's got concertina wire along the sides of it.": 1,
    "That's to prevent pirates from attacking it.": 1,
    "Piracy is a very active threat today around the world.": 1,
    "This is in the Indian Ocean.": 1,
    " Piracy is also very active in the Strait of Malacca.": 1,
    "It's active in the Gulf of Guinea.": 1,
    "We see it in the Caribbean.": 1,
    "It's a $10 billion a year discontinuity in the global transport system.": 1,
    " Last year at this time there were 20 vessels, 500 mariners held hostage.": 1,
    "This is an attack on the global commons.": 1,
    "We need to think about how to address it.": 1,
    "Let's shift to a different kind of sea.": 1,
    " the cyber sea.": 1,
    " Here are photographs of two young men.": 1,
    "At the moment, they're incarcerated.": 1,
    "They conducted a credit card fraud that netted them over $10 billion.": 1,
    " This is part of cybercrime, which is a $2 trillion a year discontinuity in the global economy.": 1,
    "$2 trillion a year.": 1,
    "That's just under the GDP of Great Britain.": 1,
    " So this cyber sea, which we know endlessly is the fundamental piece of radical openness, is very much under threat as well.": 1,
    " Another thing I worry about in the global commons is the threat posed by trafficking.": 1,
    " by the movement of narcotics, opium, here coming out of Afghanistan through Europe over to the United States.": 1,
    "We worry about cocaine coming from the Andean Ridge North.": 1,
    " We worry about the movement of illegal weapons in trafficking.": 1,
    "Above all, perhaps we worry about human trafficking and the awful cost of it.": 1,
    "Trafficking moves largely at sea, but in other parts of the global commons.": 1,
    " This is a photograph, and I wish I could tell you that this is a very high-tech piece of US Navy gear that we're using to stop the trafficking.": 1,
    " The bad news is this is a semi-submersible run by drug cartels.": 1,
    "It was built in the jungles of South America.": 1,
    "We caught it with that low-tech raft.": 1,
    " and it was carrying six tons of cocaine, crew of four, sophisticated communication suite.": 1,
    " This kind of trafficking in narcotics, in humans, in weapons, God forbid in weapons of mass destruction, is part of the threat to the global commons.": 1,
    " And let's pull it together in Afghanistan today.": 1,
    "This is a field of poppies in Afghanistan.": 1,
    "Eighty to ninety percent of the world's poppy, opium, and heroin comes out of Afghanistan.": 1,
    " We also see there, of course, terrorism.": 1,
    "This is where Al-Qaeda staged from.": 1,
    "We also see a very strong insurgency embedded there.": 1,
    " So this terrorism concern is also part of the global commons and what we must address.": 1,
    " So here we are, 21st century.": 1,
    "We know our 20th century tools are not going to work.": 1,
    "What should we do?": 1,
    " I would argue that we will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun.": 1,
    "We will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun.": 1,
    " We will need the application of military force.": 1,
    "When we do it, we must do it well and competently.": 1,
    "But my thesis is open source security is about international": 1,
    " interagency, private-public connection pulled together by this idea of strategic communication": 1,
    " on the internets.": 1,
    "Let me give you a couple examples of how this works in a positive way.": 1,
    "This is Afghanistan.": 1,
    "These are Afghan soldiers.": 1,
    "They are all holding books.": 1,
    " You should say, that's odd.": 1,
    "I thought I read that this demographic, young men and women in their 20s and 30s, is largely illiterate in Afghanistan.": 1,
    "You would be correct.": 1,
    " 85% cannot read when they enter the security forces of Afghanistan.": 1,
    "Why?": 1,
    "Because the Taliban withheld education during the period of time in which these men and women would have learned to read.": 1,
    " Why are they all standing there holding books?": 1,
    "The answer is we are teaching them to read in literacy courses.": 1,
    " by NATO in partnership with private sector entities, in partnership with development agencies.": 1,
    "We have taught well over 200,000 Afghan security forces to read and write at a basic level.": 1,
    " When you can read and write in Afghanistan, you will typically put a pen in your pocket.": 1,
    " at the ceremonies when these young men and women graduate, they take that pen with great pride and put it in their pocket.": 1,
    " This is bringing together international, there are 50 nations involved in this mission, inter-agency, these development agencies.": 1,
    " and private public to take on this kind of security.": 1,
    "Now we were also teaching them combat skills, of course.": 1,
    " But I would argue open source security means connecting in ways that create longer lasting security effect.": 1,
    " Here's another example.": 1,
    "This is a U.S.": 1,
    "Navy warship.": 1,
    "It's called the Comfort.": 1,
    "It's a sister ship called the Mercy.": 1,
    " They are hospital ships.": 1,
    "This one, the Comfort, operates throughout the Caribbean and the coast of South America, conducting patient treatments.": 1,
    "On a typical cruise, they'll do 400,000 patient treatments.": 1,
    " It is crude not strictly by military, but by a combination of humanitarian organizations.": 1,
    "Operation HOPE, Project SMILE, other organizations send volunteers.": 1,
    " interagency physicians come out.": 1,
    "They're all part of this.": 1,
    "To give you one example of the impact this can have,": 1,
    " This little boy, eight years old, walked with his mother two days to come to the eye clinic put on by the comfort.": 1,
    " When he was fitted over his extremely myopic eyes, he suddenly looked up and said, Mama, veo el mundo.": 1,
    "Mom, I see the world.": 1,
    " multiply this by 400,000 patient treatments, this private-public collaboration with security forces, and you begin to see the power of creating security in a very different way.": 1,
    " Here you see baseball players.": 1,
    "Can you pick out the two U.S.": 1,
    "Army soldiers in this photograph?": 1,
    " air the two young men on either side of these young boys.": 1,
    "This is part of a series of baseball clinics where we have explored collaboration between Major League Baseball": 1,
    " the Department of State who sets up the diplomatic piece of this, military baseball players who are real soldiers with real skills but participate in this mission,": 1,
    " and they put on clinics throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, in Honduras, in Nicaragua.": 1,
    " in all of the Central American and Caribbean nations where baseball is so popular.": 1,
    "And it creates security.": 1,
    " It shows role models to young men and women about fitness and about life that I would argue help create security for us.": 1,
    " Another aspect of this partnership is in disaster relief.": 1,
    "This is a US Air Force helicopter participating after the tsunami in 2004, which killed 250,000 people.": 1,
    " In each of these major disasters, the tsunami in 2004, 250,000 dead, the Kashmiri earthquake in Pakistan, 2005, 85,000 dead,": 1,
    " The Haitian earthquake, about 300,000 dead.": 1,
    "More recently, the awful earthquake tsunami combination which struck Japan and its nuclear industry.": 1,
    " In all of these instances, we see partnerships between international actors, interagency, private public working with security forces to respond to this kind of natural disaster.": 1,
    " So these are examples of this idea of open source security.": 1,
    " We tie it together increasingly by doing things like this.": 1,
    "Now, you're looking at this thinking, ah, Admiral, these must be sea lanes of communication, or these might be fiber optic cables.": 1,
    " No, this is a graphic of the world according to Twitter.": 1,
    " Purple are tweets.": 1,
    "Green are geolocation.": 1,
    "White is the synthesis.": 1,
    "It's a perfect evocation": 1,
    " of that great population survey, the six largest nations in the world in descending order, China, India, Facebook, the United States, Twitter, and Indonesia.": 1,
    " Why do we want to get in these nets?": 1,
    "Why do we want to be involved?": 1,
    "We talked earlier about the Arab Spring and the power of all this.": 1,
    "I'll give you another example and it's how you move this message.": 1,
    " I gave a talk like this in London a while back about this point.": 1,
    "I said, as I say to all of you, I'm on Facebook, friend me.": 1,
    " Got a little laugh in the audience.": 1,
    "There was an article which was run by AP on the wire, got picked up in two places in the world, Finland and Indonesia.": 1,
    " The headline was, NATO Admiral Needs Friends.": 1,
    "Which I do.": 1,
    " And the story was a catalyst.": 1,
    "And the next morning, I had hundreds of Facebook friend requests from Indonesians and Finns, mostly saying, Admiral, we heard you need a friend.": 1,
    " And, oh, by the way, what is NATO?": 1,
    " Yeah, we laugh, but this is how we move the message.": 1,
    "And moving that message is how we connect international, interagency, private, public, and these social nets to help create security.": 1,
    " Now let me hit a somber note.": 1,
    "This is a photograph of a brave British soldier.": 1,
    "He's in the Scots Guards.": 1,
    "He's standing to watch in Helmand in southern Afghanistan.": 1,
    " I put him here to remind us, I would not want anyone to leave the room thinking that we do not need capable, competent militaries who can create real military effect.": 1,
    " That is the core of who we are and what we do.": 1,
    "And we do it to protect freedom, freedom of speech, all the things we treasure in our societies.": 1,
    " But, you know, life is not an on and off switch.": 1,
    "You don't have to have a military that is either in hard combat or is in the barracks.": 1,
    " I would argue life is a rheostat.": 1,
    "You have to dial it in.": 1,
    "And as I think about how we create security in this 21st century, there will be times": 1,
    " when we will apply hard power in true war and crisis.": 1,
    "But there will be many instances, as we've talked about today, where our militaries can be part of creating 21st century security.": 1,
    " international, interagency, private-public, connected with competent communication.": 1,
    " I would close by saying that we heard earlier today about Wikipedia.": 1,
    "I use Wikipedia all the time to look up facts.": 1,
    "And as all of you appreciate,": 1,
    " Wikipedia is not created by 12 brilliant people locked in a room writing articles.": 1,
    "Wikipedia every day is tens of thousands of people inputting information.": 1,
    " and every day millions of people withdrawing that information.": 1,
    "It's a perfect image for the fundamental point that no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together.": 1,
    " No one person, no one alliance, no one nation, no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together.": 1,
    " The vision statement of Wikipedia is very simple, a world in which every human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.": 1,
    " My thesis for you is that by combining international, interagency, private-public, strategic communication together in this 21st century, we can create the sum of all security.": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1
