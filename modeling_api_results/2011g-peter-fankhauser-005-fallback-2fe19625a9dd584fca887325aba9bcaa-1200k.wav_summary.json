    " Thank you.": 2,
    " Let me introduce to you ReZero.": 1,
    "This little fella was developed by a group of ten undergraduate students at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory at ETH Zurich.": 1,
    "Our robot belongs to a family of robots called ballbots.": 1,
    " Instead of wheels, a ball-bot is balancing and moving on one single ball.": 1,
    "The main characteristics of such a system is that there's one sole contact point to the ground.": 1,
    "This means that the robot is inherently unstable.": 1,
    " It's like when I'm trying to stand on one foot.": 1,
    " You might ask yourself, what's the usefulness of a robot that's unstable?": 1,
    "And I will explain that in a second.": 1,
    "Let me first explain how ReZero actually keeps his balance.": 1,
    "ReZero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor.": 1,
    " He then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately.": 1,
    "This happens 160 times per second, and if anything faced during this process, Residue would immediately fall to the ground.": 1,
    " To move and to balance, ReZero needs to turn the ball.": 1,
    "The ball is driven by three special wheels that allow ReZero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time.": 1,
    " Due to its instability, Riziro is always in motion.": 1,
    "Now here's the trick.": 1,
    "It's indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very dynamic.": 1,
    " Let's play a little.": 1,
    "You may have wondered what happens if I give the robot a little push.": 1,
    " In this mode he's trying to maintain his position.": 1,
    " For the next demo, I'd like you to introduce to my colleagues Michael on the computer and Thomas who's helping me on stage.": 1,
    " In the next mode ReZero is passive and we can move him around.": 1,
    " With almost no force I can control his position and his velocity.": 1,
    " We can also make him spin.": 1,
    " In the next mode, we can get you here to follow a person.": 1,
    " He's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas.": 1,
    " This works with a laser sensor that's mounted on top of ReZero.": 1,
    " With the same method, we can also get him to circle a person.": 1,
    " We call this the orbiting mode.": 1,
    " you": 1,
    " All right.": 1,
    "Thank you, Thomas.": 1,
    " Now, what's the use of this technology?": 1,
    " For now, it's an experiment.": 1,
    "But let me show you some possible future applications.": 1,
    " ReZero could be used in exhibitions or parks.": 1,
    "With its screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way.": 1,
    " In a hospital, this device could be used to carry around medical equipment.": 1,
    "Due to the ball-bot system, it has a very small footprint and it's also easy to move around.": 1,
    "And of course, who wouldn't like to take a ride on one of these?": 1,
    " These are more practical applications, but there's also a certain beauty within this technology.": 1
