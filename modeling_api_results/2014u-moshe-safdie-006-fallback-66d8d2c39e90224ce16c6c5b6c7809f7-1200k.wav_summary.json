    " When in 1960, still a student, I got a traveling fellowship to study housing in North America.": 1,
    " We traveled the country.": 1,
    "We saw public housing, high-rise buildings in all major cities.": 1,
    " New York, Philadelphia, those who had no choice lived there.": 1,
    "And then we traveled from suburb to suburb.": 1,
    "And I came back thinking,": 1,
    " We've got to reinvent the apartment building.": 1,
    "There has to be another way of doing this.": 1,
    "We can't sustain suburbs.": 1,
    "So let's design a building which gives": 1,
    " the qualities of a house to each unit.": 1,
    "Habitat would be all about gardens, contact with nature, streets instead of corridors.": 1,
    "We prefabricated it so we would achieve economy.": 1,
    " And there it is almost 50 years later.": 1,
    " It's a very desirable place to live in.": 1,
    "It's now a heritage building, but it did not proliferate.": 1,
    " In 1973, I made my first trip to China.": 1,
    " It was the Cultural Revolution.": 1,
    " We traveled the country, met with architects and planners.": 1,
    "This is Beijing then.": 1,
    "Not a single high-rise building in Beijing or Shanghai.": 1,
    "Shenzhen didn't even exist as a city.": 1,
    " There were hardly any cars.": 1,
    " 30 years later, this is Beijing for there.": 1,
    " This is Hong Kong.": 1,
    "If you're wealthy, you live there.": 1,
    "If you're poor, you live there.": 1,
    "But high density it is.": 1,
    "And it's not just Asia.": 1,
    "San Paolo, you can travel in a helicopter, 45 minutes.": 1,
    " seeing those high-rise buildings consume the 19th century low-rise environment.": 1,
    "And with it comes congestion, and we lose mobility, and so on and so forth.": 1,
    " So a few years ago, we decided to go back and rethink habitat.": 1,
    "Could we make it more affordable?": 1,
    "Could we actually achieve this quality of life and the densities that are prevailing today?": 1,
    " And we realized it's basically about light, it's about sun, it's about nature, it's about fractalization.": 1,
    "Can we open up the surface of the building so that it has more contact with the exterior?": 1,
    " We came up with a number of models, economy models, cheaper to build and more compact, membranes of housing which people could design their own house and create their own gardens.": 1,
    " And then we decided to take New York as a test case, and we looked at Lower Manhattan.": 1,
    " And we mapped all the building area in Manhattan.": 1,
    "On the left is Manhattan today, blue for housing, red for office buildings, retail.": 1,
    " On the right, we reconfigured it.": 1,
    "The office buildings form the base and then rising 75 stories above.": 1,
    " apartments.": 1,
    "There's a street in the area on the 25th level, Community Street.": 1,
    "It's permeable.": 1,
    " There are gardens and open spaces for the community, almost every unit with its own private garden and community space all around.": 1,
    "And most important, permeable.": 1,
    " open.": 1,
    "It does not form a wall or an obstruction in the city and light permeates everywhere.": 1,
    "And in the last two, three years, we've actually been for the first time realizing the quality of life of habitat.": 1,
    " in real life projects across Asia.": 1,
    "This is Qingwandao in China, middle income housing where there is a bylaw that every apartment must receive three hours of sunlight": 1,
    " That's measured in the winter solstice.": 1,
    "And under construction in Singapore, again, middle-income housing, gardens, community streets and parks, and so on and so forth.": 1,
    "And Colombo.": 1,
    " And I want to touch on one more issue, which is the design of the public realm.": 1,
    " 100 years after we've began building with tall buildings, we're yet to understand how the tall, high-rise building becomes a building block in making a city, in creating the public realm.": 1,
    " In Singapore, we had an opportunity, 10 million square feet, extremely high density, taking the concept of outdoor and indoor, promenades and parks integrated with intense urban life.": 1,
    " So they are outdoor spaces and indoor spaces, and you move from one to the other, and there is contact with nature.": 1,
    " And most relevantly, at every level of the structure, public gardens and open space.": 1,
    "On the roof of the podium, climbing up the towers, and finally on": 1,
    " the roof, the sky park, two and a half acres, jogging paths, restaurants, and the world's longest swimming pool.": 1,
    " And that's all I can tell you in five minutes.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
