    " What you're doing right now at this very moment is killing you.": 1,
    " More than cars or the internet, or even that little mobile device we keep talking about, the technology you're using the most almost every day is this, your tush.": 1,
    " Nowadays, people are sitting 9.3 hours a day, which is more than worth sleeping at 7.7 hours.": 1,
    "Sitting is so incredibly prevalent, we don't even question how much we're doing it.": 1,
    "And because everyone else is doing it.": 1,
    " It doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay.": 1,
    "In that way, sitting has become the smoking of our generation.": 1,
    " And of course, there's health consequences to this, scary ones, besides the waste.": 1,
    "Things like breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our lack of physical inactivity.": 1,
    " 10%, in fact, on both of those.": 1,
    "6% for heart disease, 7% for type 2 diabetes, which is what my father died of.": 1,
    " Now, any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our duff more.": 1,
    "But if you're anything like me, it won't.": 1,
    " What did get me moving was a social interaction.": 1,
    "Someone invited me to a meeting but couldn't manage to fit me into a regular sort of conference room meeting and said, I have to walk my dogs tomorrow.": 1,
    "Could you come then?": 1,
    " kind of odd to do.": 1,
    "And actually, that first meeting, I remember thinking, I have to be the one to ask the next question because I knew I was going to huff and puff during this conversation.": 1,
    " And yet, I've taken that idea and made it my own.": 1,
    "So instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent lit conference room meetings, I asked people to go on a walking meeting to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week.": 1,
    " It's changed my life.": 1,
    " But before that, what actually happened was I used to think about it as you could take care of your health or you could take care of obligations.": 1,
    "And one always came at the cost of the other.": 1,
    " So now, several hundred of these walking meetings later, I've learned a few things.": 1,
    "First, there's this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out of the box thinking.": 1,
    " Whether it's nature or the exercise itself, it certainly works.": 1,
    "And second, and probably the more reflective one, is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition.": 1,
    " when they're really not that way.": 1,
    "And if we're going to solve problems and look at the world really differently, whether it's in governance or business or environmental issues, job creation,": 1,
    " Maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true.": 1,
    "Because it was when that happened with this walk and talk idea that things became doable and sustainable and viable.": 1,
    " So I started this talk talking about the tish, so I'll end with the bottom line, which is walk and talk.": 1,
    "Walk the talk.": 1,
    "You'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking.": 1,
    " And the way that you do, you'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
