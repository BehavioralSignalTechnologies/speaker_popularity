    " I thought there'd be a podium, so I'm a bit scared.": 1,
    " Chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA.": 1,
    "And since I follow his orders, I'll do it.": 1,
    "But it slightly bores me.": 1,
    " Yeah, I wrote a book.": 1,
    "So I'll say something.": 1,
    " I'll say a little about, you know, how the discovery was made and why Francis and I found it.": 1,
    "And then I hope maybe I have...": 1,
    " at least five minutes to say what makes me tick now.": 1,
    "Back of me is a picture of me when I was 17.": 1,
    "I was at the University of Chicago in my third year and": 1,
    " I was in my third year because the University of Chicago let you in after two years of high school, so it was fun to get away from high school.": 1,
    " Because I'm very small and I'm not so good in sports or anything like that.": 1,
    "But I should say that my background, my father was raised to be an Episcopalian and Republican.": 1,
    " But after one year of college, he became an atheist and a Democrat.": 1,
    "And my mother was Irish Catholic, but she didn't take...": 1,
    " Religion too seriously.": 1,
    "And by the age of 11, I was no longer going to Sunday mass and going on bird watching walks with my father.": 1,
    "So early on, I heard of Charles Darwin.": 1,
    " I guess, you know, he was the big hero and, you know, you understand life as it now exists through evolution.": 1,
    "And at the University of Chicago, I was a zoology major.": 1,
    " and thought I would end up, if I was bright enough, maybe getting a PhD from Cornell on ornithology.": 1,
    " And the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book called What is Life by the great physicist Schrodinger.": 1,
    " And that, of course, has been a question I wanted to know.": 1,
    "Darwin explained life after it got started, but what was the essence of life?": 1,
    "And Schrodinger said the essence was information.": 1,
    " present on our chromosomes and it had to be present on a molecule.": 1,
    "I never really thought of molecules before.": 1,
    " chromosome.": 1,
    "For this was a molecule and somehow the information was probably present in some digital form.": 1,
    "And there was a big question, how did you copy the information?": 1,
    " So that was the book.": 1,
    "And so from that moment on, I wanted to be a geneticist, understand the gene, and through that understand life.": 1,
    " I had a hero at a distance, wasn't a baseball player, it was Linus Poeing.": 1,
    "And so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down.": 1,
    " So I went to Indiana, which was actually as good as Caltech in genetics.": 1,
    "And besides, they had really good basketball teams.": 1,
    " I had a really quite happy life in Indiana and it was in Indiana I got the impression that, you know, the gene was likely to be DNA and so when I got my PhD I should go in search of DNA.": 1,
    " So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought, well, maybe I could become a biochemist.": 1,
    "But I discovered biochemistry was very boring.": 1,
    " It wasn't going anywhere toward saying what the gene was.": 1,
    "It was just nucleosides.": 1,
    "Oh, that's the book, the little book.": 1,
    "You can read it in about two hours.": 1,
    " But then I went to a meeting in Italy, and there was an unexpected speaker who wasn't on the program, and he talked about DNA.": 1,
    " This was Morris Wilkins.": 1,
    "He was trained as a physicist and after the war he wanted to do biophysics and he picked DNA because DNA had been shown at the Rockefeller Institute to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes.": 1,
    "Most people believed it was proteins.": 1,
    " Wilkins thought DNA was the best bet and he showed this x-ray photograph.": 1,
    " And it's sort of crystalline.": 1,
    "So DNA had a structure, even though it probably different molecules carried different set of instructions.": 1,
    "So there was something universal about the DNA molecule.": 1,
    " wanted to work with him, but he didn't want to form a bird watcher.": 1,
    "And I ended up in Cambridge, England.": 1,
    "So I went to Cambridge because": 1,
    " It was really the best place in the world then for x-ray crystallography.": 1,
    "And x-ray crystallography is now subject to, you know, chemistry departments.": 1,
    "But in those days, it was in the domain of the physicists.": 1,
    " So the best place for x-ray crystallography was in the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge.": 1,
    "And there I met Francis Crick.": 1,
    " I went there without knowing him.": 1,
    "He was 35, I was 23.": 1,
    "And within a day we": 1,
    " I decided that maybe one could take a shortcut to finding the structure, not solve it by": 1,
    " in rigorous fashion, but build a model, a molecular model, using some coordinates, some, you know, length, all that sort of stuff, from x-ray photographs, but just ask what the molecule, how should it fold up?": 1,
    " And the reason for doing so is the center of the photograph is Linus Pauling.": 1,
    "About six months before, he proposed the alpha helical structure for proteins.": 1,
    "And in doing so, he banished the man on the right, Sir Lawrence Bright.": 1,
    " who was the Cavendish professor.": 1,
    "This is photographed several years later when Bragg had caused a smile.": 1,
    "He certainly wasn't smiling when I got there because he was somewhat humiliated by Pauline getting the alpha helix and the Cambridge people failing.": 1,
    " because they weren't chemists.": 1,
    " And certainly neither Crick or I were chemists.": 1,
    "So we tried to build a model.": 1,
    " Francis knew Wilkins, and Wilkins said he thought it was the helix, x-ray diagram, he thought it was compatible with the helix.": 1,
    "So we built a three-stranded model.": 1,
    "The people from London came up, Wilkins said this.": 1,
    " collaborator or possible collaborator, Rosalind Franklin, came up and sort of laughed at our motto.": 1,
    "They said it was lousy and it was.": 1,
    "So we were told to build no more mottos.": 1,
    "We were incompetent.": 1,
    " And so we didn't build any models and Francis sort of continued to work on proteins and basically I did nothing.": 1,
    " And except read, you know, basically reading is a good thing, you get facts.": 1,
    "And we kept telling the people in London that Linus Pauling is going to move on to DNA.": 1,
    "If DNA is that important Linus will know it, he'll build a model and then we're going to be scoped.": 1,
    " In fact, he'd written the people in London.": 1,
    "Could he see their x-ray photograph?": 1,
    "And they had the wisdom to say no, so he didn't have it.": 1,
    "But there was ones in the Lich.": 1,
    "Actually, Linus didn't look at them that carefully.": 1,
    " Fifteen months after I got to Cambridge, rumors began to appear from Linus Pauling's son who was in Cambridge that his father was now working on DNA.": 1,
    " And so one day Peter came in and says, Peter Pauling, and gave me a copy of his father's manuscript.": 1,
    "And boy, I was scared because I thought...": 1,
    " You know, we may be scooped, I have nothing to do, no qualifications for anything.": 1,
    "And so there was the paper, and he proposed a free standard structure, and I read it, and it was just, it was crap.": 1,
    " Ah.": 1,
    " So this was, you know, unexpected from the world.": 1,
    " And so it was held together by hydrogen bonds between phosphate groups.": 1,
    "Well, if the pH cells have around seven, those hydrogen bonds couldn't exist.": 1,
    "We rushed over to the chemistry department and said,": 1,
    " Could Pauling be right?": 1,
    "And Alex Todd said no, so we were happy.": 1,
    " You know, we were still in the game, but we were frightened that someone in Caltech would tell more than us that he was wrong.": 1,
    "And so Braggs had built models, and a month after we got the polling manuscript,": 1,
    " I should say I took the manuscript to London to show the people, you know, that Linus was wrong and they were still in the game.": 1,
    "And they should immediately start building models.": 1,
    "But Wilkins said no.": 1,
    "Rosalind Franklin was leaving in about two months and after she left,": 1,
    " He would start building models and so I came back with that news to Cambridge and Bragg said build models or of course I wanted to build models and There was picture of Roslyn and she really": 1,
    " In one sense, she was a chemist, but really she didn't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry.": 1,
    "She was a crystallographer.": 1,
    " And I think part of the reason she didn't want to build models is she wasn't a chemist, whereas Pauline was a chemist.": 1,
    " So, Crick and I started building models, and I learned a little chemistry, but not enough.": 1,
    "Well, we got the answer on 28th of February, 1953.": 1,
    " And it was because of a rule, which to me is a very good rule, never be the brightest person in a room.": 1,
    " We weren't.": 1,
    "I mean, we weren't the best chemists in the room.": 1,
    "I went in and showed them a pairing I'd done, and then Jerry Donahue, he was a chemist.": 1,
    "He says, wrong, you've got the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place.": 1,
    " I just put them down like they were in the books.": 1,
    "He said they were wrong.": 1,
    "So the next day, you know, after, I thought, well, he might be right.": 1,
    "So I changed locations and then we found": 1,
    " the bass pairing, and Francis and me, they said the chains run in episode directions, and we knew we were right.": 1,
    "So it was a pretty, you know, all happened in about two hours.": 1,
    " you know, from nothing to big.": 1,
    "And we knew it was big because, you know, if you just put A next to T and G next to C, you have a copying mechanism.": 1,
    " So we saw how genetic information is carried.": 1,
    "It's the order of the four bases.": 1,
    "So in a sense, it is a sort of digital type information.": 1,
    "And you copy it by going from strand separating.": 1,
    " So if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it, because you didn't have any other scheme.": 1,
    " But that's not the way most scientists think.": 1,
    "Most scientists are really rather dull.": 1,
    "They say, we won't think about it until we know it's right.": 1,
    " But we thought it was at least 95% right or 99% right.": 1,
    "So think about it.": 1,
    "The next five years, there were essentially something like five references to our work in nature.": 1,
    "None.": 1,
    " And so we were left by ourselves and trying to do the last part of the trio.": 1,
    "How do you...": 1,
    " What does the genetic information do?": 1,
    "And it was pretty obvious that it provided the information to an RNA molecule, and then how do you go from RNA to protein?": 1,
    " For about three years we just, I tried to solve the structure RNA, it didn't yield, didn't give good x-ray photographs, I was largely unhappy, a girl didn't marry me, it was really, you know, sort of a shitty time.": 1,
    " Oh, there's a picture of Francis and I before I met the girl, so I'm still looking happy.": 1,
    " But there is what we did when we didn't know where to go forward.": 1,
    "We formed a club.": 1,
    " and called it the RNA Tie Club.": 1,
    "George Gamow, the great physicist, he designed the tie.": 1,
    "He was one of the members.": 1,
    "And the question was, how do you go from a four-letter code to the 20-letter code of proteins?": 1,
    " Feynman was a member and Teller and friends of Gamow.": 1,
    "We were only photographed twice in both occasions, one of us was missing the tie.": 1,
    " Francis up on the upper right and Alex Rich, the MD turned crystallographers next to me.": 1,
    "This was taken in Cambridge in September of 1955.": 1,
    " I'm smiling, sort of forced, I think, because the girl, boy, she is gone.": 1,
    " So, I didn't really get happy until 1960.": 1,
    " Because then we found out basically, you know, that there are three forms of RNA and we knew basically DNA provides the information.": 1,
    "RNA, RNA provides the information.": 1,
    "Protein.": 1,
    " And that led Marshall Nirenberg, you know, to take RNA, synthetic RNA, put it in a system of making protein, you made poly...": 1,
    " Phenylalanine, probably you mean phenylalanine.": 1,
    "So the first cracking of the genetic code and it was all over by 1966.": 1,
    " So that's what Chris wanted me to do.": 1,
    "So what happened since then?": 1,
    "Well, at that time,": 1,
    " I shouldn't go back.": 1,
    "When we found the structure of DNA, in my first talk at Cold Spring Harbor, the physicist Leo Szilard said, are you going to patent it?": 1,
    " But he knew patent law and knew we couldn't patent it because there was no use for it.": 1,
    " And so DNA didn't become a useful molecule, and the lawyers didn't enter into the equation until 1973, 20 years later, when Boyer and Cohen": 1,
    " in San Francisco and Stanford came up with their method of recombinant DNA and Stanford patented and made a lot of money.": 1,
    "That is, they patented something which, you know, could do useful things and": 1,
    " Then they learned how to read the letters for the code, and boom, we've": 1,
    " No, head by tech industry.": 1,
    " But we're still a long ways from, you know, answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood, which is": 1,
    " How do you nature nurture?": 1,
    "And so I'll go on.": 1,
    "I'm already out of time, but this is Michael Wigler, a very, very clever": 1,
    " mathematician turned physicist and he developed a technique which essentially will let us look at sample DNA of eventually a million spots.": 1,
    " If there's a chip there, a conventional one, then there's one made by a photolithography by a company in Madison called Nimblegen, which is way ahead of Affymetrix, and we use their technique.": 1,
    " And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal say versus cancer and you can see on the top that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions.": 1,
    " So the DNA is really badly mucked up, whereas if you have a chance of surviving, the DNA isn't so mucked up.": 1,
    "So we think that this will eventually lead to what we call DNA biopsies.": 1,
    "Before you get treated for cancer, you should really": 1,
    " look at this technique and get a feeling of the face of the enemy.": 1,
    "It's not a... It's only a partial look, but it's a...": 1,
    " I think it's going to be very, very useful.": 1,
    "So we started with breast cancer because there's lots of money for it, no government money.": 1,
    " And now I have a sort of vested interest.": 1,
    "I want to do it for prostate cancer.": 1,
    "So you know, you aren't treated if, you know, it's not dangerous.": 1,
    " And so, but Wigler, besides looking at cancer cells, looked at normal cells and made a really sort of surprising observation, which is all of us have about 10 places in our genome where we've lost a gene or gained another one.": 1,
    " for more information on": 1,
    " So we're sort of all imperfect.": 1,
    "And the question is, well, if we're around here, these losses or gains might not be too bad.": 1,
    " But if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene, maybe you really are sick.": 1,
    "So the first disease he looked at was autism.": 1,
    " And the reason that we looked at autism was we had the money to do it.": 1,
    "To look at an individual with about $3,000 and the parent of a child with Asperger's disease, the high-intelligence autism, had sent his": 1,
    " thing to a conventional company that didn't do it, couldn't do it by conventional genetics, but just scanning it, we began to find genes for autism.": 1,
    "And you can see here, there are a lot of them.": 1,
    " So a lot of autistic kids are autistic because they just lost a big piece of DNA.": 1,
    "I mean, big piece at the molecular level.": 1,
    "We saw one autistic kid, five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes.": 1,
    " We haven't yet looked at the parents, but the parents probably don't have that law, so they wouldn't be parents.": 1,
    " Now, so our autism study is just beginning.": 1,
    "We got $3 million.": 1,
    "I think it will cost at least 10 to 20 before.": 1,
    " You'd be in a position to help parents who've had an autistic child or think they may have an autistic child and can we spot the difference.": 1,
    "So this same technique should probably look at all.": 1,
    "It's a wonderful way to find genes.": 1,
    " And so I'll conclude by saying we've looked at 20 people with schizophrenia.": 1,
    " And we thought we probably had to look at several hundred before we got a picture.": 1,
    "But as you can see there, seven out of 20 had a change which was very high.": 1,
    "And in the controls there were three.": 1,
    " So what's the meaning of the controls?": 1,
    "Were they crazy also and we didn't know it or, you know, were they normal?": 1,
    "I would guess they're normal.": 1,
    "And what we think in schizophrenia is they're genes of predisposure.": 1,
    " And...": 1,
    " whether this is one predisposes, and then there's only a sub-segment of the population that's capable of being schizophrenic.": 1,
    "Now we don't have really": 1,
    " any evidence of it.": 1,
    "What I see, to give a hypothesis, the best guess": 1,
    " is that if you're left handed, you're prone to schizophrenia.": 1,
    "30% of schizophrenic people are left handed.": 1,
    " And schizophrenia has a very funny genetics, which means 60% of the people are genetically left-handed, but only half of it should.": 1,
    "I don't have the time to say it.": 1,
    "Now, some people who think they're right-handed are genetically left-handed.": 1,
    " OK, I'm just saying that if you think, oh, I don't carry a left-handed gene, so therefore my children won't be at risk of schizophrenia, you might.": 1,
    "OK.": 1,
    " So it's, to me, an extraordinarily exciting time.": 1,
    "We ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar.": 1,
    "There's a relationship.": 1,
    "And if I had enough money, we'd find them all this year.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
