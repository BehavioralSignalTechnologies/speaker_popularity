    "Thank you very much.": 5,
    "Seven.": 4,
    "Six.": 4,
    "Good.": 3,
    "Yes.": 3,
    "Okay.": 3,
    "Bring it out.": 2,
    "That's three.": 2,
    " Thank you very much.": 2,
    " Let me try to take this one step further.": 2,
    "What year?": 2,
    "And what month?": 2,
    " Well, good morning ladies and gentlemen, my name is Art Benjamin and I am a mathemagician.": 1,
    " What that means is I combine my loves of math and magic to do something I call mathemagics.": 1,
    "But before I get started, I have a quick question for the audience.": 1,
    "By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator?": 1,
    " Seriously, if you have a calculator with you, raise your hand.": 1,
    "Raise your hand.": 1,
    "Did your hand go up?": 1,
    "Anybody else?": 1,
    "I see one way in the back.": 1,
    "You, sir.": 1,
    "And anybody on this side here?": 1,
    " Okay, you over there on the aisle.": 1,
    "Would the four of you with calculators please bring out your calculators, then join me up on stage and let's give these volunteers a nice round of applause.": 1,
    " Now, since I haven't had the chance to work with these calculators, I need to make sure that they are all working properly.": 1,
    "Would somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number, please?": 1,
    "How about a two-digit number?": 1,
    " 22 and another two digit number sir.": 1,
    "Multiply 22 times 47 make sure you get 1,034 or the calculators are not working.": 1,
    "Do all of you get 1,034? 1,034?": 1,
    " 594?": 1,
    "Let's give three of them a nice round of applause there.": 1,
    " Would you like to try a more standard calculator just in case?": 1,
    "OK, great.": 1,
    "What I'm going to try and do then, I noticed that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer.": 1,
    "That's OK.": 1,
    " I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator.": 1,
    "There's something called the square of a number, which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself.": 1,
    "For instance, 5 squared would be?": 1,
    " 25.": 1,
    "Now the way we can square on most calculators, let me demonstrate with this one, is by taking the number such as 5, hitting times": 1,
    " and then equals, and on most calculators that will give you the square.": 1,
    "On some of these ancient RPN calculators, you've got an X squared button on it, will allow you to do the calculation even faster.": 1,
    "What I'm going to try and do now is to square in my head": 1,
    " four two-digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators, even using the shortcut method.": 1,
    "What I'll use is the second row this time.": 1,
    "I get four of you, one, two, three, four, to each yell out a two-digit number.": 1,
    "And if you would square the first number,": 1,
    " And if you would square the second, the third, and the fourth, I will try and race you to the answer, OK?": 1,
    "So quickly, a two-digit number, please.": 1,
    "37 squared, OK?": 1,
    " 23 squared, okay.": 1,
    "59 squared, okay.": 1,
    "And finally, 93 squared.": 1,
    "Would you call out your answers, please?": 1,
    "I'm going to try to square some three digit numbers this time.": 1,
    "I won't even write these down.": 1,
    "I'll just call them out as they're called out to me.": 1,
    "Anyone I point to call out a three digit number, anyone on our panel,": 1,
    " verify the answer.": 1,
    "Just give some indication if it's right.": 1,
    "A three digit number, sir, yes?": 1,
    "987 squared is 974,169.": 1,
    " Yes.": 1,
    "Another three digit.": 1,
    " Another three digit number, sir.": 1,
    "457 squared is 205,849.": 1,
    "Yes?": 1,
    "Okay, another three digit number, sir.": 1,
    " 321 is 103,041, 103041.": 1,
    "Yes, one more three-digit number, please.": 1,
    " 722 is 500, that's a harder one.": 1,
    "Is that 513,284?": 1,
    "One more three digit number, please.": 1,
    "162 squared is 26,244.": 1,
    " I'm going to try to square a four-digit number this time.": 1,
    "Now you can all take your time on this.": 1,
    "I will not beat you to the answer on this one, but I will try to get the answer right.": 1,
    " To make this a little bit more random, let's take the fourth row this time.": 1,
    "Let's say one, two, three, four.": 1,
    "If each of you would quad a single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit number that I'll square.": 1,
    " Nine, seven, five, eight.": 1,
    "Nine, seven, five, eight.": 1,
    "This will take me a little bit of time, so bear with me.": 1,
    "95 million.": 1,
    " 218,564?": 1,
    " Now I would attempt to square a five digit number and I can, but unfortunately most calculators cannot.": 1,
    " 8 digit capacity, don't you hate that?": 1,
    "So since we've reached the limits of our calculators, what's that?": 1,
    "Does yours go higher?": 1,
    "Yours does.": 1,
    " I'll talk to you later.": 1,
    "In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier.": 1,
    "Let's take the largest number on the board here, 8649.": 1,
    "Would you each enter that on your calculator?": 1,
    " And instead of squaring it this time, I want you to take that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want.": 1,
    "But don't tell me what you're multiplying by, just multiply it by any random three-digit number.": 1,
    " So you should have as an answer either a six digit or probably a seven digit number.": 1,
    "How many digits do you have, six or seven?": 1,
    "Seven and yours?": 1,
    " and uncertain.": 1,
    "Is there any possible way that I could know what seven digit numbers you have?": 1,
    "Say no.": 1,
    " Good.": 1,
    "Then I shall attempt the impossible, or at least the improbable.": 1,
    "What I'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits, any six of them, in any order you'd like.": 1,
    " One digit at a time, I shall try and determine the digit you've left out.": 1,
    "So starting with your seven digit number, Sonny, call out any six of them, please.": 1,
    " 19.": 1,
    " Did you leave out the number six?": 1,
    "Good, okay, that's one.": 1,
    "You have a seven digit number, call out any six of them, please.": 1,
    " I think I only heard five numbers.": 1,
    "Four, four, eight, seven, five.": 1,
    "Did you leave out the number six?": 1,
    "Same as she did.": 1,
    "Okay, you've got a seven-digit number.": 1,
    "Call out any six of them loud and clear.": 1,
    " I think you left out the number three.": 1,
    "The odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in ten thousand.": 1,
    "Ten to the fourth power.": 1,
    "Okay, any six of them.": 1,
    "Really scramble them up this time, please.": 1,
    " You do about the number seven.": 1,
    "And let's give all four of these people a nice round of applause.": 1,
    " for my next number.": 1,
    " While I mentally recharge my batteries, I have one more question for the audience.": 1,
    "By any chance, does anybody here happen to know": 1,
    " the day of the week that they were born on.": 1,
    "If you think you know your birthday, raise your hand.": 1,
    "Let's see, starting with, let's start with the gentleman first.": 1,
    "Okay, sir, what year was it first of all?": 1,
    "That's why I start with the gentleman first.": 1,
    " 1953 in the month?": 1,
    "November what?": 1,
    " 23rd was that a Monday?": 1,
    "Yes, good somebody else who else would like I don't have to see anything women's hands.": 1,
    "How about you?": 1,
    " 1949 in the month?": 1,
    "October what?": 1,
    "Fifth was that a Wednesday?": 1,
    "Yes, I'll go way to the back right now.": 1,
    "How about you yell it out what year?": 1,
    " 1959, okay, in the month?": 1,
    "February.": 1,
    "February what?": 1,
    "Six, was that a Friday?": 1,
    "How about the person behind her?": 1,
    "What year was it?": 1,
    "1947 in the month?": 1,
    " May what?": 1,
    "Seventh.": 1,
    "Seventh?": 1,
    "Would that be a Wednesday?": 1,
    " Anybody here who'd like to know the day of the week they were born, we can do it that way.": 1,
    " Of course, I could just make up an answer and you wouldn't know.": 1,
    "So I come prepared for that.": 1,
    "I brought with me a book of calendars.": 1,
    "Goes as far back in the past as 1800, because you never know.": 1,
    " I didn't mean to look at you sir, you were just sitting there.": 1,
    "Anyway, Chris, you can help me out here if you wouldn't mind.": 1,
    "This is the book of calendars and I'll ask who was it that wanted to know their birthday?": 1,
    "You sir?": 1,
    "Okay, what year was it first of all?": 1,
    " turn to the calendar with 1966.": 1,
    "April.": 1,
    "April what?": 1,
    "17th.": 1,
    "17th, I believe that was a Sunday.": 1,
    "Can you confirm, Chris?": 1,
    " Yeah, okay.": 1,
    "I'll tell you what, Chris, as long as you have that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s or way into the 2000s.": 1,
    "That'll be a much greater challenge for me.": 1,
    "What year, Chris, would you like?": 1,
    " 1824.": 1,
    "June.": 1,
    "June what?": 1,
    "Was that a Sunday?": 1,
    "It was.": 1,
    "And it was cloudy.": 1,
    " But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation.": 1,
    "There was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator.": 1,
    "Where is he?": 1,
    "Would you stand up, 10-digit guy?": 1,
    " Okay, stand up for me just for a second so I can see where you are.": 1,
    " Okay, you have a 10-digit calculator, sir, as well?": 1,
    "What I'm going to try and do is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator, but...": 1,
    " To make my job more interesting for you as well as for me, I'm going to do this problem thinking out loud.": 1,
    " So you can actually, honestly hear what's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size.": 1,
    "Now I have to apologize to our magician friend, Leonard Green.": 1,
    "I know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets, but": 1,
    " I'm not too afraid that people are gonna start doing my show next week, so I think we're okay.": 1,
    " So, let's see, let's take a different row of people, starting with you, I'll get five digits, one, two, three, four, I did this row already, let's do the row before you.": 1,
    " Starting with you, sir.": 1,
    "One, two, three, four, five.": 1,
    "Crawl out a single digit.": 1,
    "That will be the five digit number that I will try to square.": 1,
    "Go ahead.": 1,
    "Five.": 1,
    "Eight.": 1,
    "Three.": 1,
    " 57,683 squared.": 1,
    "Yuck.": 1,
    " Let me explain to you how I'm going to attempt this problem.": 1,
    "I'm going to break the problem down into three parts.": 1,
    "I'll do 57,000 squared plus 683 squared.": 1,
    " plus 57,000 times 683 times two.": 1,
    "Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer.": 1,
    "Now let me recap.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " while I explain something else.": 1,
    " I know that you can use, right?": 1,
    "While I do these calculations, you might hear certain words as opposed to numbers creep into the calculation.": 1,
    "Let me explain what that is.": 1,
    " This is a phonetic code, a mnemonic device that I use that allows me to convert numbers into words.": 1,
    "I store them as words and later on retrieve them as numbers.": 1,
    " I know it sounds complicated.": 1,
    "It's not.": 1,
    "I just don't want you to think you're seeing something out of Rain Man here.": 1,
    "There's definitely a method to my madness.": 1,
    "Definitely, definitely.": 1,
    "Sorry.": 1,
    " Oh, god.": 1,
    " You want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards, you can talk to me about that.": 1,
    "By the way, one last instruction, for my judges with the calculators, okay, you know who you are, there is at least": 1,
    " a 50% chance that I will make a mistake here.": 1,
    "If I do, don't tell me what the mistake is, just say you're close or something like that and I'll try and figure out the answer which could be pretty entertaining in itself.": 1,
    " If, however, I am right, whatever you do, don't keep it to yourself, okay?": 1,
    "Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right, because this is my big finish, okay?": 1,
    "So, without any more stalling,": 1,
    " Here we go.": 1,
    "I'll start the problem in the middle with 57 times 683.": 1,
    "Now, 57 times 68 is 3400 plus 476 is 3876.": 1,
    "That's 38,760 plus 171.": 1,
    " $38,931.": 1,
    "Double that to get $77,862.": 1,
    "$77,862 becomes cookie-ficient.": 1,
    " Fishin' is 77,822, that seems right.": 1,
    "I'll go on, cookie fishin'.": 1,
    "Okay, next I do 57 squared, which is 3,249, so I can say,": 1,
    " 3 billion, take the 249, add that to cookie.": 1,
    "249, oops, but I see a carry coming.": 1,
    "249, add that to cookie.": 1,
    "250 plus 77 is 327.": 1,
    " million.": 1,
    "Fishin' fishin'.": 1,
    "Okay, finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666 plus 17 squared is 466,489.": 1,
    "Rev up if I need it.": 1,
    "Rev up, take the 466, add that to fishin' to get": 1,
    " Oh, gee.": 1,
    "Good!": 1,
    " I hope you enjoyed Math-O-Magic.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
