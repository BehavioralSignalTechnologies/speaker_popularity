    " Now, I don't usually like cartoons.": 1,
    "I don't think many of them are funny.": 1,
    "I think I find them weird.": 1,
    "But I love this cartoon from The New Yorker.": 1,
    " So the guy is telling the cat, don't you dare think outside the box.": 1,
    "Well, I'm afraid I used to be the cat.": 1,
    " I always wanted to be outside the box and it's partly because I came to this field from a different background, chemist and a bacterial geneticist.": 1,
    " So what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer, sources of cancer, or for that matter why you are who you are, didn't make sense.": 1,
    "So let me quickly try and tell you why I thought that and how I went about it.": 1,
    " We'll be right back.": 1,
    " So to begin with, however, I have to give you a very, very quick lesson in developmental biology with apologies to those of you who know some biology.": 1,
    "So when your mom and dad met,": 1,
    " There is a fertilized egg, that round thing with that little blip.": 1,
    "It grows, and then it grows, and then it makes this handsome man.": 1,
    " This guy with all the cells in his body": 1,
    " all have the same genetic information.": 1,
    "So how did his nose become his nose?": 1,
    "His elbow his elbow?": 1,
    "And why doesn't he get up one morning and have his nose turned into his foot?": 1,
    " It could.": 1,
    "It has the genetic information.": 1,
    "You all remember Dolly.": 1,
    "It came from a single mammary cell.": 1,
    "So why doesn't it do it?": 1,
    "So have a guess of how many cells he has in his body.": 1,
    " Somewhere between 10 trillion to 70 trillion cells in his body.": 1,
    "Trillion!": 1,
    " Now how did these cells, all with the same genetic material, made all those tissues?": 1,
    "And so the question I raised before becomes even more interesting if you taught about the enormity": 1,
    " of this in every one of your bodies.": 1,
    "Now the dominant cancer theory would say that there is a single oncogene in a single cancer cell and it would make you a cancer victim.": 1,
    " Well, this did not make sense to me.": 1,
    "Do you even know how a trillion looks?": 1,
    "Now let's look at it.": 1,
    "There it comes, these zeros after zeros after zeros.": 1,
    " Now, if 0.0001 of these cells got mutated and 0.0001 got cancer, you'll be a lump of cancer.": 1,
    "You'll have cancer all over you and you're not.": 1,
    " Why not?": 1,
    "So I decided over the years because of a series of experiments that this is because of context and architecture.": 1,
    "And let me quickly tell you": 1,
    " some crucial experiment that was able to actually show this.": 1,
    " To begin with, I came to work with this virus that causes that ugly tumor in the chicken.": 1,
    "Rouse discovered this in 1911.": 1,
    "It was the first cancer virus": 1,
    " discovered and when I call it oncogene meaning cancer gene.": 1,
    "So he made a filtrate, he took this filter which was liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter.": 1,
    " and he injected it to another chicken and he got another tumor.": 1,
    "So scientists were very excited and they said this single oncogene can do it.": 1,
    "All you need is a single oncogene.": 1,
    " So they'd put the cells in cultures, chicken cells, dump the virus on it and it would pile up and they would say this is malignant and this is normal.": 1,
    "And again, this didn't make sense to me.": 1,
    " So for various reasons, we took this oncogene, attached it to a blue marker, and we injected it into the embryos.": 1,
    "Now look at that.": 1,
    " There is that beautiful feather in the embryo.": 1,
    "Every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene inside a cancer cell, and they're part of the feather.": 1,
    " So when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish, we got mass of blue cells.": 1,
    "So in the chicken you get a tumor, in the embryo you don't.": 1,
    "You dissociate, you put it in a dish, you get another tumor.": 1,
    " What does that mean?": 1,
    "That means that microenvironment and the context which surround those cells": 1,
    " actually are telling the cancer gene and the cancer cell what to do.": 1,
    "Now, let's take a normal example.": 1,
    "The normal example, let's take the human mammary gland.": 1,
    "I work on breast cancer.": 1,
    " So here is a lovely human breast and many of you know how it looks except that inside that breast there are all these pretty developing tree-like structures.": 1,
    " So we decided that what we like to do is to take just a bit of that mammary gland, which is called an acinus.": 1,
    " where there are all these little things inside the breast where the milk goes and the end of the nipple comes through that little tube when the baby sucks.": 1,
    " And we said, wonderful, look at this pretty structure.": 1,
    "We want to make this structure and ask the question, how do the cells do that?": 1,
    " So we took the red cells.": 1,
    "You see the red cells are surrounded by blue, other cells that squeeze them, and behind it is material that people thought was mainly inert.": 1,
    " And it was just having the structure to keep the shape.": 1,
    "And so we first photographed it with the electron microscope years and years ago.": 1,
    "And you see the cell is actually quite pretty.": 1,
    " It has a bottom, it has a top, it is secreting gobs and gobs of milk because it just came from an early pregnant mouse.": 1,
    "You take these cells, you put them in a dish, and within three days they look like that.": 1,
    " They completely forget.": 1,
    "So you take them out, you put them in a dish, they don't make milk, they completely forget.": 1,
    " For example, here is a lovely yellow droplet of milk on the left, there is nothing on the right.": 1,
    "Look at the nuclei.": 1,
    "The nuclei on the cell on the left is in the animal, the one on the right is on a dish.": 1,
    " They're completely different from each other.": 1,
    "So what does this tell you?": 1,
    "This tells you that here also, context overrides.": 1,
    " In different contexts, cells do different things, but how does context signal?": 1,
    "So, Einstein said that for an idea that does not first seem insane, there is no hope.": 1,
    " So you can imagine the amount of skepticism I received.": 1,
    "Couldn't get money, couldn't do a whole lot of other things, but I'm so glad it all worked out.": 1,
    "So we made a section of the mammary gland of the mammary.": 1,
    " and all those lovely asanoids are there.": 1,
    "Every one of those with the red around them are an asinus.": 1,
    " And we said, okay, we are going to try and make this.": 1,
    "And I said, maybe that red stuff around the asanas that people think is just a structural scaffold, maybe it has information.": 1,
    " Maybe it tells the cells what to do.": 1,
    "Maybe it tells the nucleus what to do.": 1,
    "So I said extracellular matrix, which is this stuff called ECM, signals and actually tells the cells what to do.": 1,
    " So we decided to make things that would look like that.": 1,
    "We found some gooey material that had the right extracellular matrix in it.": 1,
    " We put the cells in it, and lo and behold, in about four days they got reorganized, and on the right is what we can make in culture.": 1,
    " On the left is what's inside the animal.": 1,
    "We call it in vivo.": 1,
    "And the one in culture was full of milk.": 1,
    "The lovely red there is full of milk.": 1,
    "So we got milk for the American audience.": 1,
    " All right.": 1,
    "And here is this beautiful human cell, and you can imagine that here also context goes.": 1,
    "So...": 1,
    " What do we do now?": 1,
    "I made a radical hypothesis.": 1,
    "I said if it's true that architecture is dominant, architecture": 1,
    " restored to a cancer cell should make the cancer cell think it's normal.": 1,
    "Could this be done?": 1,
    "So we tried it.": 1,
    " In order to do that, however, we needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant.": 1,
    " on the left is the single normal cell, human breast, put in three-dimensional gooey gel that has extracellular matrix.": 1,
    "It makes all this beautiful structure.": 1,
    "On the right": 1,
    " You see it looks very ugly.": 1,
    "The cells continue to grow.": 1,
    "The normal ones stop.": 1,
    "And you see here in higher magnification, the normal asinus and the ugly tumor.": 1,
    " So we said, what is on the surface of these ugly tumors?": 1,
    "Could we calm them down?": 1,
    "They were signaling like crazy and they have pathways all messed up and make them to the level of the normal.": 1,
    "Well,": 1,
    " It was wonderful, boggles my mind.": 1,
    "This is what we got.": 1,
    "We can revert the malignant phenotype.": 1,
    " And in order to show you that the malignant phenotype, I didn't just choose one, here are little movies, sort of fuzzy, but you see that on the left are the malignant cells.": 1,
    "All of them are malignant.": 1,
    "We add one,": 1,
    " single inhibitor at the beginning, and look what happens.": 1,
    "They all look like that.": 1,
    "We inject them into the mouse, the ones on the right, and none of them would make tumors.": 1,
    " We inject the other ones in the mouse, 100% tumors.": 1,
    "So it's a new way of thinking about cancer.": 1,
    "It's a hopeful way of thinking about cancer.": 1,
    "We should be able to be dealing with these things at this level.": 1,
    " And these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior is regulated at the level of tissue organization and that the tissue organization is dependent on the extracellular matrix": 1,
    " and the microenvironment.": 1,
    "All right, that's form and function.": 1,
    " Interact dynamically and reciprocally.": 1,
    "And here is another five second of repose, is my mantra.": 1,
    "Form and function.": 1,
    " And of course, we now ask, where do we go now?": 1,
    "We like to take these kind of thinking into the clinic.": 1,
    "But before we do that,": 1,
    " I'd like you to think that at any given time when you're sitting there in your 70 trillion cells,": 1,
    " the extracellular matrix signaling to your nucleus, the nucleus is signaling to your extracellular matrix, and that is how your balance": 1,
    " is kept and restored.": 1,
    "We have made a lot of discoveries.": 1,
    "We have shown that extracellular matrix talks to chromatin.": 1,
    "We have shown that there are little pieces of DNA on the specific genes of the mammary gland.": 1,
    " that actually respond to extracellular matrix.": 1,
    "It has taken many years, but it has been very rewarding.": 1,
    "And before I get to the next slide, I have to tell you that": 1,
    " There are so many additional discoveries to be made.": 1,
    "There is so much mystery we don't know.": 1,
    "And I always say to the student and postdocs I lecture to, don't be arrogant.": 1,
    " Because arrogance kills curiosity.": 1,
    "Curiosity and passion.": 1,
    "You need to always think what else needs to be discovered and maybe my discovery needs to be added to or maybe it needs to be changed.": 1,
    " So we have now made an amazing discovery, a postdoc in the lab who is a physicist asked me, what do the cells do when you put them in?": 1,
    "What do they do in the beginning when they do?": 1,
    "I said, I don't know.": 1,
    "We couldn't look at them.": 1,
    "We didn't have high images.": 1,
    " in the old days.": 1,
    "So she being an imager and a physicist did this incredible thing.": 1,
    "This is a single human breast cell.": 1,
    " In a three-dimension, look at it.": 1,
    "It's constantly doing this, has a coherent movement.": 1,
    "You put the cancer cells there and they do go all over.": 1,
    "They do this, they don't do this.": 1,
    " And when we revert the cancer cell, it again does this.": 1,
    "Absolutely boggles my mind.": 1,
    "So the cell acts like an embryo.": 1,
    "What an exciting thing.": 1,
    " So I like to finish with a poem, but I used to love English literature and I debated in college which one should I do and": 1,
    " Unfortunately, or fortunately, chemistry won.": 1,
    "But here is a poem from Yeats.": 1,
    "I'll just read you the last two lines.": 1,
    " It's called Among the School Children, O Body Suede to Music, O Brightening Glance, How Do We Tell the Dancer from the Dance.": 1,
    " And here is Merce Cunningham.": 1,
    "I was fortunate to dance with him when I was younger.": 1,
    "And here he is a dancer.": 1,
    "And while he's dancing, he's both the dancer and the dance.": 1,
    "The minute he stops, we have neither.": 1,
    " So it's like form and function.": 1,
    " Now, I'd like to show you a current picture of my group.": 1,
    "I have been fortunate to have had these magnificent students.": 1,
    " and postdoc who have taught me so much and I have had many of these groups come and go.": 1,
    "They are the future and I try to make them": 1,
    " not be afraid of being the cat and being told don't think outside the box.": 1,
    "And I'd like to leave you with this thought.": 1,
    "On the left,": 1,
    " is water coming through the shore taken from a NASA satellite.": 1,
    "On the right, there is a coral.": 1,
    " Now, if you take the mammary gland and spread it and take the fat away on a dish, it looks like that.": 1,
    "Do they look the same?": 1,
    "Do they have the same patterns?": 1,
    "Why is it that nature keeps doing that over and over again?": 1,
    " And I'd like to submit to you that we have sequenced the human genome.": 1,
    "We know everything about the sequence of the gene, the language of the gene, the alphabet of the gene, but we know nothing but nothing.": 1,
    " about the language and alphabet of form.": 1,
    " So it's a wonderful new horizon.": 1,
    "It's a wonderful thing to discover for the young and the passionate old, and that's me.": 1,
    "So go to it.": 1,
    " Thank you, thank you.": 1
