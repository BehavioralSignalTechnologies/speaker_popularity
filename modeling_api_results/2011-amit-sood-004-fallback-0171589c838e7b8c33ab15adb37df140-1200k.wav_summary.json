    " Thank you.": 2,
    " My name is Amit and 18 months ago I had another job at Google and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss, who's actually here, and she allowed me to do it.": 1,
    "And it took 18 months.": 1,
    " A lot of fun negotiations and stories I can tell you with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries, but I'm going to focus on the demo.": 1,
    " There are a lot of stories about why we did this.": 1,
    "I think my personal story is explained very simply in this slide and it's access.": 1,
    " I grew up in India, I had a great education, not complaining, but I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks.": 1,
    "And so when I started travelling and going to these museums, I started learning a lot.": 1,
    " And while working at Google, I try to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together.": 1,
    "So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing this.": 1,
    "I'm going to probably get into the demo and then, you know,": 1,
    " tell you a couple of the interesting things we've had since launch.": 1,
    " So simple, you come to GoogleArtProject.com, you look around, all these museums here, you've got the Uffizi, you've got the MoMA, the Homitage, the Reichs, the Van Gogh.": 1,
    "I'm going to actually get to one of my favorites.": 1,
    " the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.": 1,
    "Two ways of going in.": 1,
    "Very simple.": 1,
    "Click.": 1,
    " and bang, you're in this museum, doesn't matter where you are, Bombay, Mexico, doesn't really matter.": 1,
    "You move around, you have fun, you want to navigate around the museum, open the plan up, and in one click, jump.": 1,
    " You're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor, keep going, have fun, you know, explore.": 1,
    " Thanks, I haven't come to the best part.": 1,
    "So now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, The Harvesters by Peter Bruegel at the Met.": 1,
    "I see this plus sign.": 1,
    "If the museum has given us the image, you click on it.": 1,
    " Now, this is one of the images, so this is all the metadata information for those of you who are truly interested in art.": 1,
    "You can click this, but I'm going to click this off right now.": 1,
    "And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call GigaPixel technology.": 1,
    " This image, for example, has close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels.": 1,
    "And I get a lot of people asking me, what do you get for 10 billion pixels?": 1,
    "So I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels.": 1,
    " You can zoom around very simply.": 1,
    "You see some fun stuff happening here.": 1,
    "I love this guy.": 1,
    "His expression is priceless.": 1,
    "But then you really want to go deep.": 1,
    "So I started playing around.": 1,
    " And I found something going on over here.": 1,
    "And I was like, hold on.": 1,
    "That sounds interesting.": 1,
    "Went in.": 1,
    "And I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something.": 1,
    " I did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met, and actually found out that this is a game called Skoll, which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday, and apparently it was quite popular.": 1,
    "I don't know why they did it.": 1,
    " But, you know, I learned something about it.": 1,
    "Now, just, you know, we're really deep in.": 1,
    "You can really get the cracks.": 1,
    "Now, just to give you some perspective, I'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get.": 1,
    "Here is where we were, and this is the painting.": 1,
    " So.": 1,
    " The best is yet to come, so in a second.": 1,
    "So now let's just quickly jump into the MoMA again in New York.": 1,
    " So, another one of my favorites, the Starry Night.": 1,
    "Now, the example I showed you was all about finding details.": 1,
    "But what if you want to see brush strokes?": 1,
    "And what if you want to see, you know, how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece?": 1,
    " You zoom in, you really go in.": 1,
    "I'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting and I'm really going to get to the cracks.": 1,
    "This is the Starry Night.": 1,
    "I think, you know, never seen like this before.": 1,
    " I'm going to show you my other favorite feature.": 1,
    "There's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.": 1,
    "This is the real cool part.": 1,
    "It's called collections.": 1,
    "Any one of you, anybody, it doesn't matter if you're rich, if you're poor, if you have a fancy": 1,
    " It doesn't matter.": 1,
    "You can go and create your own museum online, create your own collection across all these images.": 1,
    "Very simply, you go in, and I've created this called the power of Zoom.": 1,
    "You can just zoom around.": 1,
    "This is the ambassadors.": 1,
    " based in the National Gallery.": 1,
    "You can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends, and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these masterpieces.": 1,
    " So I think in conclusion, for me, the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google.": 1,
    "It doesn't, in my opinion, even come from the museums.": 1,
    "Probably shouldn't say that.": 1,
    "It really comes from these artists.": 1,
    " And that's been my humbling experience in this.": 1,
    "I mean, I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online.": 1,
    "And the biggest question I get asked nowadays": 1,
    " is did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum?": 1,
    "And the answer is no.": 1,
    "It's to supplement the experience.": 1,
    "And that's it.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
