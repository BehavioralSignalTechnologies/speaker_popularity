    " We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship.": 1,
    " And it is, and yet it feels natural to us now.": 1,
    "I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11, 2001.": 1,
    " We didn't know if he had perished yet until 36 hours later.": 1,
    " at the time": 1,
    " We knew that it was political.": 1,
    "We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son, my husband Orlando and I, and our family.": 1,
    " And when I saw it, and yet through the shock and the terrible shock and the terrible explosion in our lives, literally, we were not vengeful.": 1,
    " And a couple of weeks later when Zacharias Massawi was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism.": 1,
    " And the US government called for a death penalty for him if convicted.": 1,
    "My husband and I spoke out.": 1,
    " in opposition for that publicly.": 1,
    "Through that and through human rights groups, we were brought together with several other victims' families.": 1,
    "When I saw Aisha in the media,": 1,
    " coming over when her son was indicted.": 1,
    "And I thought, what a brave woman.": 1,
    "Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger.": 1,
    "I was still in deep grief.": 1,
    "I knew I didn't have the strength.": 1,
    " I knew I would find her someday or we would find each other.": 1,
    "Because when people heard that my son was a victim, I got immediate sympathy.": 1,
    " but when people learned what her son was accused of.": 1,
    " She didn't get that sympathy.": 1,
    "But her suffering is equal to mine.": 1,
    "So we met in November 2002, and Aisha will now tell you how that came about.": 1,
    " Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.": 1,
    "I am the mother of Zacharias Moussaoui.": 1,
    " It's true.": 1,
    " When she arrived, I asked for human rights to contact me.": 1,
    " asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims.": 1,
    " So they introduced me to five families and I saw Phyllis and I watched her.": 1,
    " She was the only mother in the group.": 1,
    " The others were brothers, sisters.": 1,
    "And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother just like me.": 1,
    " I suffered a lot as a mother.": 1,
    " I was married when I was 14.": 1,
    "I lost a child when I was 15.": 1,
    "A second child when I was 16.": 1,
    " So the story with Zacharias was too much, really.": 1,
    "And I still suffer.": 1,
    " Because my son is buried alive.": 1,
    "I know she really cried for her son, but she knows where he is.": 1,
    " My son, I don't know where he is.": 1,
    "I don't know if he's alive.": 1,
    "I don't know if he's tortured.": 1,
    "I don't know what happened to him.": 1,
    " So that's why I decided to tell my story so that my suffering is something positive for other women.": 1,
    " for all the women, all the mothers that give life.": 1,
    " You can give back, you can change.": 1,
    "It's up to us, women, because we are women.": 1,
    " because we love our children.": 1,
    "We must be hand in hand and do something together.": 1,
    " It's not against women, it's for us, for us women.": 1,
    " I go to schools, I speak for young Muslim girls, to not get married.": 1,
    "I also go against violence, against terrorism.": 1,
    " I talk against violence, against terrorism.": 1,
    "I go to schools to talk to young Muslim girls so that they don't accept to be married against their will very young.": 1,
    " And if I can save a girl or two from this horrible marriage, this violence inside of them, I remember myself.": 1,
    "It is a glory, despite the fact that I am miserable.": 1,
    " So unless, you know, if I can save one of the young girls and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did, well, this is something good.": 1,
    " This is why I'm here in front of you.": 1,
    "I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aisha.": 1,
    "Starting with that day, we had our very first meeting with other family members, which was a very private meeting with security.": 1,
    " because it was November 2002 and frankly we were afraid of the super patriotism at that time, the country, those of us family members.": 1,
    " But we were all so nervous.": 1,
    "Why does she want to meet us?": 1,
    "And then she was nervous.": 1,
    "Why did we want to meet her?": 1,
    "What did we want from each other?": 1,
    " Before we knew each other's names or anything, we had embraced and wept.": 1,
    "Then we sat in a circle with support, with help from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation.": 1,
    " And Aisha started and she said, I don't know if my son is guilty or innocent, but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families.": 1,
    " I know what it is to suffer.": 1,
    "And I feel that if there is a crime, a person should be tried fairly and punished.": 1,
    " But she reached out to us in that way, and it was, I like to say, it was an icebreaker, you know.": 1,
    "And what happened then is we all told our stories.": 1,
    " And we all connected as human beings.": 1,
    "By the end of the afternoon, it was about three hours after lunch, we felt as if we'd known each other forever.": 1,
    " Now what I learned from her is a woman not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then and what was being done to her son, but the life she's had I never had met someone": 1,
    " with such a hard life from such a totally different culture and environment from my own.": 1,
    "And I feel that we have": 1,
    " a special connection which I value very much.": 1,
    "And I think it's all about being afraid of the other but making that step.": 1,
    " And then realizing, hey, this wasn't so hard.": 1,
    "Who else can I meet that I don't know or that I'm so different from?": 1,
    " So Aisha, do you have a couple of words for conclusion?": 1,
    "Because our time is up.": 1,
    " I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people, the other.": 1,
    " You have to be generous and your heart must be generous, your mind must be generous.": 1,
    " We must be tolerant.": 1,
    "We have to fight against violence.": 1,
    " And I hope that someday we'll all live together in peace and respecting each other.": 1,
    "This is what I wanted to say.": 1
