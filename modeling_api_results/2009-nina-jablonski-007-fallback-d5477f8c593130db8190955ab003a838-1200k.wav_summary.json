    " Interestingly, Charles Darwin was born a very lightly pigmented man in a moderately to darkly pigmented world.": 1,
    " Over the course of his life, Darwin had great privilege.": 1,
    "He lived in a fairly wealthy home.": 1,
    " He was raised by very supportive and interested parents.": 1,
    "And when he was in his twenties, he embarked upon a remarkable voyage on the ship, the Beagle.": 1,
    " And during the course of that voyage, he saw remarkable things, tremendous diversity of plants and animals and humans.": 1,
    " and the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book on the origin of species published 150 years ago.": 1,
    " Now, what is so interesting and to some extent what's a bit infamous about the origin of species is there's only one line": 1,
    " in it about human evolution.": 1,
    "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.": 1,
    " It wasn't until much later that Darwin actually spoke and wrote about humans.": 1,
    " Now, in his years of traveling on the Beagle, and from listening to the accounts of explorers and naturalists, he knew that skin color": 1,
    " was one of the most important ways in which people varied.": 1,
    "And he was somewhat interested in the pattern of skin color.": 1,
    " He knew that darkly pigmented peoples were found close to the equator, lightly pigmented peoples, like himself, were found closer to the poles.": 1,
    " So what did he make of all this?": 1,
    "Well, he didn't write anything about it in The Origin of Species.": 1,
    "But much later, in 1871, he did have something to say about it and it was quite curious.": 1,
    " He said, of all the differences between the races of men, the color of the skin is the most conspicuous and one of the best marked.": 1,
    "And he went on to say, these differences do not coincide with corresponding differences in climate.": 1,
    " So he had traveled all around, he had seen people of different colors living in different places, and yet he rejected the idea that human skin pigmentation was related to the climate.": 1,
    " If only Darwin lived today.": 1,
    "If only Darwin had NASA.": 1,
    " Now, one of the wonderful things that NASA does is it puts up a variety of satellites that detect all sorts of interesting things about our environment.": 1,
    " And for many decades now, there have been a series of Toms satellites that have collected data about radiation at the Earth's surface.": 1,
    "The Toms 7 satellite data, shown here,": 1,
    " show the annual average ultraviolet radiation at the Earth's surface.": 1,
    " Now, the really hot pink and red areas are those parts of the world that receive the highest amounts of UV during the year.": 1,
    "The incrementally": 1,
    " Cooler colors, blues, greens, yellows and finally grays, indicate areas of much lower ultraviolet radiation.": 1,
    " What's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation is just how much of the northern hemisphere is in these cool gray zones.": 1,
    " This has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation.": 1,
    "And what Darwin": 1,
    " could not appreciate or didn't perhaps want to appreciate at the time is that there was a fundamental relationship between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and skin pigmentation.": 1,
    " and that skin pigmentation itself was a product of evolution.": 1,
    "And so when we look at the map": 1,
    " of skin color and predicted skin color as we know it today, what we see is a beautiful gradient from the darkest skin pigmentation toward the equator and the lightest ones toward the poles.": 1,
    " Now, what's very, very important here is that the earliest humans evolved in high UV environments in equatorial Africa.": 1,
    "The earliest members of our lineage": 1,
    " the genus Homo were darkly pigmented.": 1,
    "And we all share this incredible heritage of having originally been darkly pigmented two million to one and a half million years ago.": 1,
    " Now what happened in our history?": 1,
    " Let's first look at the relationship of ultraviolet radiation to the Earth's surface in those early days of our evolution.": 1,
    " at the equator, we were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation.": 1,
    "The UVC, the most energetic type, was": 1,
    " occluded by the Earth's atmosphere, but UVB and UVA especially came in unimpeded.": 1,
    "UVB turns out to be incredibly important.": 1,
    " It's very destructive, but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin D in the skin.": 1,
    "Vitamin D being a molecule that we very much need for our strong bones,": 1,
    " the health of our immune system and myriad other important functions in our bodies.": 1,
    "So living at the equator we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin": 1,
    " This wonderful, complex, ancient polymer compound in our skin served as a superb natural sunscreen.": 1,
    " This polymer is amazing because it's present in so many different organisms.": 1,
    "Melanin in various forms has probably been on the earth a billion years and has been recruited over and over again by evolution.": 1,
    " as often happens.": 1,
    "Why change it if it works?": 1,
    "So Melanin was recruited in our lineage and specifically in our earliest ancestors evolving in Africa.": 1,
    " to be a natural sunscreen where it protected the body against the depredations of ultraviolet radiation, the destruction or damage to DNA": 1,
    " and the breakdown of a very important molecule called folate, which helps to fuel cell production and reproduction in the body.": 1,
    " So, it's wonderful.": 1,
    "We evolved this very protective, wonderful covering of melanin, but then we moved.": 1,
    " and humans dispersed not once but twice major moves outside of our equatorial homeland": 1,
    " from Africa into other parts of the old world and most recently into the new world.": 1,
    "When humans dispersed into these latitudes, what did they face?": 1,
    " conditions were significantly colder, but they were also less intense with respect to the ultraviolet regime.": 1,
    "So if we're somewhere in the northern hemisphere,": 1,
    " Look at what's happening to the ultraviolet radiation.": 1,
    "We're still getting a dose of UVA, but all of the UVB, or nearly all of it, is dissipated through the thickness of the atmosphere.": 1,
    " In the winter, when you are skiing in the Alps, you may experience ultraviolet radiation, but it's all UVA, and significantly that UVA has no ability to make vitamin D in your skin.": 1,
    " So people inhabiting northern hemispheric environments were bereft of the": 1,
    " potential to make vitamin D in their skin for most of the year.": 1,
    "This had tremendous consequences for the evolution of human skin pigmentation because what happened in order to ensure health and well-being": 1,
    " These lineages of people dispersing into the northern hemisphere lost their pigmentation.": 1,
    "There was natural selection for the evolution of lightly pigmented skin.": 1,
    " Here we begin to see the evolution of the beautiful sepia rainbow that now characterizes all of humanity.": 1,
    "Lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once,": 1,
    " not just twice, but probably three times, not just in modern humans, but in one of our distant, unrelated ancestors, the Neanderthals.": 1,
    "A remarkable, remarkable testament to the power of evolution.": 1,
    " Humans have been on the move for a long time, and just in the last 5,000 years, at increasing rates over increasing distances, here are just some of the biggest...": 1,
    " movements of people, voluntary movements in the last 5,000 years.": 1,
    "Look at some of the major latitudinal transgressions.": 1,
    "People from high UV areas going to low UV and vice versa.": 1,
    " And not all these moves were voluntary.": 1,
    "Between 1520 and 1867, 12,500,000 people were moved from high UV to low UV areas.": 1,
    " in the transatlantic slave trade.": 1,
    "Now, this had all sorts of invidious social consequences, but it also had deleterious health consequences to people.": 1,
    " So what?": 1,
    "We've been on the move.": 1,
    "We're so clever, we can overcome all of these seeming biological impediments.": 1,
    " Well, often we're unaware of the fact that we're living in environments in which our skin is inherently poorly adapted.": 1,
    " Some of us with lightly pigmented skin live in high UV areas.": 1,
    "Some of us with darkly pigmented skin live in low UV areas.": 1,
    "These have tremendous consequences for our health.": 1,
    " We have to, if we're lightly pigmented, be careful about the problems of skin cancer and destruction of folate in our bodies by lots of sun.": 1,
    " Epidemiologists and doctors have been very good about telling us about protecting our skin.": 1,
    "What they haven't been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people": 1,
    " living in high-latitude areas or working inside all the time because the problem there is just as severe, but it is more sinister because vitamin D deficiency from a lack of ultraviolet B radiation": 1,
    " is a major problem vitamin D deficiency creeps up on people and causes all sorts of health problems to their bones": 1,
    " to their gradual decay of their immune systems or loss of immune function and probably some problems with their mood and health, their mental health.": 1,
    " So we have in skin pigmentation one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today.": 1,
    " And the social consequences, as we know, are incredibly profound.": 1,
    "We live in a world where we have lightly and darkly pigmented people living next to one another, but often": 1,
    " brought into proximity initially as a result of very invidious social interactions.": 1,
    "So how can we overcome this?": 1,
    "How can we begin to understand it?": 1,
    "Evolution helps us.": 1,
    " 200 years after Darwin's birthday, we have the first moderately pigmented President of the United States.": 1,
    "How wonderful is that?": 1,
    " This man is significant for a whole host of reasons, but we need to think about how he compares in terms of his pigmentation to other people on earth.": 1,
    "He, as one of many urban admixed populations,": 1,
    " is very emblematic of a mixed parentage, mixed pigmentation, and he resembles very closely people with moderate levels of pigmentation who live in Southern Africa or Southeast Asia.": 1,
    " These people have a tremendous potential to tan, to develop more pigment in their skin as a result of exposure to sun.": 1,
    "They also run the risk of vitamin D deficiency if they have desk jobs like that guy.": 1,
    " So let's all wish for his great health and his awareness of his own skin pigmentation.": 1,
    " Now, what is wonderful about the evolution of human skin pigmentation and the phenomenon of pigmentation is that it is the demonstration.": 1,
    " the evidence of evolution by natural selection right on your body.": 1,
    " When people ask you, what is the evidence for evolution?": 1,
    "You don't have to think about some exotic examples or fossils.": 1,
    "You just have to look at your skin.": 1,
    "Darwin, I think, would have appreciated this.": 1,
    " even though he eschewed the importance of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life, I think were he...": 1,
    " able to look at the evidence we have today.": 1,
    "He would understand it.": 1,
    "He would appreciate it.": 1,
    "And most of all, he would teach it.": 1,
    " You.": 1,
    "You can teach it.": 1,
    "You can touch it.": 1,
    "You can understand it.": 1,
    "Take it out of this room.": 1,
    "Take your skin color and celebrate it.": 1,
    " Spread the word.": 1,
    "You have the evolution of the history of our species.": 1,
    "Part of it written in your skin.": 1,
    "Understand it, appreciate it, celebrate it, go out.": 1,
    " Isn't it beautiful?": 1,
    "Isn't it wonderful?": 1,
    "You are the products of evolution.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
