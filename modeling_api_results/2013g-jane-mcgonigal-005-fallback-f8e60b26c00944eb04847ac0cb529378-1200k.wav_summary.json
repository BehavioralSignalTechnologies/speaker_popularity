    "You got it?": 2,
    "Woo!": 2,
    "Thank you.": 2,
    " Today, I'm going to teach you how to play my favorite game.": 1,
    " massively multiplayer, thumb wrestling.": 1,
    "It's the only game in the world that I know of that allows you, the player, the opportunity to experience": 1,
    " 10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less.": 1,
    "This is true.": 1,
    "So if you play this game with me today for just one single minute,": 1,
    " you will get to feel joy, relief, love, surprise, pride, curiosity, excitement, all in wonder, contentment, and creativity.": 1,
    " all in the span of one minute.": 1,
    "So it sounds pretty good, right?": 1,
    "Now you're willing to play.": 1,
    "In order to teach you this game, I'm going to need some volunteers to come up on stage really quickly.": 1,
    "We're going to do a little hands-on demo.": 1,
    "While they're coming up, I should let you know this game was invented 10 years ago.": 1,
    " by an artist collective in Austria named Monochrome.": 1,
    "So thank you, Monochrome.": 1,
    "Okay.": 1,
    "So most people are familiar with traditional two-person thumb wrestling.": 1,
    "Sunny, let's...": 1,
    " Just remind them, one, two, three, four, I declare thumb war, and we wrestle, and of course Sunny beats me because she's the best.": 1,
    "Now, the first thing about massively multiplayer thumb wrestling, we're the gamer generation.": 1,
    "There are a billion gamers on the planet now, so we need more of a challenge.": 1,
    " So the first thing we need is more thumbs.": 1,
    "So Eric, come on over.": 1,
    "So we could get three thumbs together.": 1,
    " And Peter could join us.": 1,
    "We could even have four thumbs together and the way you win is you're the first person to pin someone else's thumb.": 1,
    "This is really important.": 1,
    " You can't wait while they fight it out and then swoop in at the last minute.": 1,
    "That is not how you win.": 1,
    "Ah, who did that?": 1,
    "Eric, who did that?": 1,
    "So Eric would have won.": 1,
    "He was the first person to pin my thumb.": 1,
    " Okay, so that's the first rule, and we can see that three or four is kind of the typical number of sums in a node, but if you feel ambitious,": 1,
    " You don't have to hold back.": 1,
    "We can really go for it.": 1,
    "So you can see up here.": 1,
    "Okay, now the only other rule you need to remember is, you know, gamer generation, we like a challenge.": 1,
    " I happen to notice you all have some thumbs you're not using.": 1,
    "So I think we should kind of get some more involved.": 1,
    "And if we had just four people, we would do it just like this.": 1,
    "And we would try and wrestle both thumbs at the same time.": 1,
    " Now, perfect.": 1,
    "Now, if we had more people in the room, instead of just wrestling in a closed node, we might reach out and try and grab some other people.": 1,
    " And in fact, that's what we're going to do right now.": 1,
    "We're going to try and get all something like, I don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this room connected in a single node.": 1,
    "And we have to connect both levels.": 1,
    "So if you're up there,": 1,
    " you're going to be reaching down and reaching up.": 1,
    "Now, before we get started, this is great.": 1,
    "You're excited to play.": 1,
    "Before we get started, can I have the slides back up here really quick?": 1,
    " If you get good at this game, I want you to know there are some advanced levels.": 1,
    "So this is the kind of simple level, right?": 1,
    "But there are advanced configurations.": 1,
    "This is called the Death Star configuration.": 1,
    "Any Star Wars fans?": 1,
    " This one's called the Mobius strip.": 1,
    "Any science geeks, you get that one.": 1,
    "This is the hardest level.": 1,
    "This is the extreme.": 1,
    "So we'll stick with the normal one for now.": 1,
    " and I'm gonna give you 30 seconds, every thumb into the node, connect the upper and the lower levels, you guys go on down there.": 1,
    "30 seconds into the network, make the node.": 1,
    " Stand up, it's easier if you stand up.": 1,
    "Everybody up, up, up, up, up.": 1,
    " Stand up, my friends.": 1,
    " All right, don't start wrestling yet.": 1,
    "If you have a free thumb, wave it around, make sure it gets connected.": 1,
    " Okay, we need to do a last minute thumb check.": 1,
    "If you have a free thumb, wave it around to make sure.": 1,
    "Grab that thumb.": 1,
    "Yeah, yeah, yeah, reach behind you.": 1,
    "There you go.": 1,
    "Any other thumbs?": 1,
    " Okay, on the count of three, you're gonna go, try to keep track, grab, grab, grab it.": 1,
    "Okay, one, two, three, go.": 1,
    " Did you win?": 1,
    "Excellent.": 1,
    "Well done.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1,
    "All right.": 1,
    " While you are basking in the glow of having won your first Massive Multiplication game, let's do a quick recap on the positive emotions.": 1,
    "So, curiosity.": 1,
    " I said massively multiplayer thumb wrestling.": 1,
    "You were like, what the hell is she talking about?": 1,
    "So I provoked a little curiosity.": 1,
    "Creativity.": 1,
    "It took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thumbs into the door and reaching around and reaching up.": 1,
    "So use creativity.": 1,
    "That was great.": 1,
    " How about surprise?": 1,
    "The actual feeling of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once is pretty surprising.": 1,
    "You heard that sound go up in the room.": 1,
    "We had excitement as you started to wrestle.": 1,
    "Maybe you're starting to win or this person's like really into it.": 1,
    " Get the excitement going.": 1,
    "We have relief.": 1,
    "You got to stand up.": 1,
    "You've been sitting for a while.": 1,
    "You have physical relief, getting to shake it out.": 1,
    "We had joy.": 1,
    "You were laughing, smiling.": 1,
    "Look at your faces.": 1,
    "This room is full of joy.": 1,
    " Some contentment.": 1,
    "I didn't see anybody sending text messages or checking their email while we were playing.": 1,
    "So we were totally content to be playing.": 1,
    "The most important three emotions.": 1,
    "All in wonder.": 1,
    "We had everybody connected physically.": 1,
    " for a minute.": 1,
    "When was the last time you were at TED and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room?": 1,
    "And it's truly awesome and wondrous.": 1,
    "And speaking of physical connection, you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin.": 1,
    "You release oxytocin, you feel bonded to everyone in the room.": 1,
    " You guys know that the best way to release oxytocin quickly is to hold someone else's hand for at least six seconds.": 1,
    "You guys were all holding hands for way more than six seconds.": 1,
    "So we are all now biochemically primed to love each other.": 1,
    "That is great.": 1,
    " The last emotion of pride.": 1,
    "How many people are like you, like me?": 1,
    "Just admit it.": 1,
    "You lost both your thumbs.": 1,
    "It just didn't work out for you.": 1,
    " That's okay, because you learned a new skill today.": 1,
    "You learned from scratch a game you never knew before.": 1,
    "Now you know how to play it, you can teach other people, so congratulations.": 1,
    "How many of you won just one thumb?": 1,
    " All right, I have very good news for you.": 1,
    "According to the official rules of massively multiplayer thumb wrestling, this makes you a grand master of the game.": 1,
    "Because there aren't that many people who know how to play, we have to kind of accelerate.": 1,
    " the program more than a game like chess.": 1,
    "So congratulations, grandmasters.": 1,
    "Win one thumb once, you will become a grandmaster.": 1,
    "Did anybody win both their thumbs?": 1,
    " Yes, awesome.": 1,
    "Okay, get ready to update your Twitter, Facebook status.": 1,
    "You guys, according to the rules, are legendary grandmasters.": 1,
    "So congratulations.": 1,
    "I will just leave you with this tip if you want to play again.": 1,
    " The best way to become a legendary grandmaster, you've got your two nodes going on.": 1,
    "Pick off the one that looks easiest.": 1,
    "They're not paying attention.": 1,
    "They look kind of weak.": 1,
    "Focus on that one and do something crazy with this arm as soon as you win.": 1,
    " and suddenly stop, everyone's just thrown off, you go in for the kill, that's how you become a legendary Grandmaster, massively multiplied, everything.": 1,
    "Thank you for letting me teach you my favorite game.": 1
