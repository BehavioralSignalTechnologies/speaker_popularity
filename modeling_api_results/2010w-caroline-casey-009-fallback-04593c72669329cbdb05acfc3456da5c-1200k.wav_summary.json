    "What do you want to be?": 3,
    "Do something different.": 2,
    " Can any of you remember what you wanted to be when you were 17?": 1,
    " Do you know what I wanted to be?": 1,
    "I wanted to be a biker chick.": 1,
    " I wanted to race cars and I wanted to be a cowgirl and I wanted to be Mowgli from the Jungle Book.": 1,
    " because they were all about being free.": 1,
    "Wind in your hair, just to be free.": 1,
    " And on my 17th birthday, my parents, knowing how much I love speed, gave me one driving lesson for my 17th birthday.": 1,
    "Not that we could have afforded I drive, but to give me the dream of driving.": 1,
    " and on my 17th birthday, I accompanied my little sister in complete innocence as I always had all my life.": 1,
    " my visually impaired sister, to go to see an eye specialist.": 1,
    "Because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters.": 1,
    " And my little sister wants to be a pilot, God help her.": 1,
    "So I used to get my eyes tested just for fun.": 1,
    "And on my 17th birthday, after my fake eye exam,": 1,
    " The art specialist just noticed it happened to me on my birthday.": 1,
    "And he said, so what are you going to do to celebrate?": 1,
    " And I took that driving lesson and I said, I'm gonna learn how to drive.": 1,
    " And then there was a silence.": 1,
    " One of those awful silences when you know something's wrong.": 1,
    " and he turned to my mother.": 1,
    " And he said, you haven't told her yet.": 1,
    " on my 17th birthday.": 1,
    " As Janice Ian would best say, I learned the truth at 17.": 1,
    " I am and have been since birth legally blind.": 1,
    " And you know how on earth did I get to 17 and not know that?": 1,
    "Well, if anybody says country music isn't powerful, let me tell you this.": 1,
    " I got there because my father's passion for Johnny Cash and a song, A Boy Named Sue.": 1,
    " I'm the eldest of three.": 1,
    "I was born in 1971.": 1,
    "And very shortly after my birth, my parents found out I had a condition called ocular albinism.": 1,
    "And what the hell does that mean to you?": 1,
    " So let me just tell you the great part of all of this.": 1,
    "I can't see this clock and I can't see the timing.": 1,
    "So, holy God!": 1,
    "Woohoo!": 1,
    "I might buy some more time.": 1,
    "But more importantly, let me tell you, I'm going to just come up really close here.": 1,
    "Don't freak out, Pat.": 1,
    " Hey, see this hand?": 1,
    "Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline.": 1,
    "Every man in this room, even you Steve, is George Clooney.": 1,
    " And every woman, you are so beautiful.": 1,
    "And when I want to look beautiful, I step three feet away from the mirror.": 1,
    "And I don't have to see these lines etched in my face from all the squinting I've done all my life from all the dark lights.": 1,
    " The really strange part is that at three and a half, just before I was going to school, my parents made a bizarre, unusual, and incredibly brave decision.": 1,
    " No special needs schools.": 1,
    " No labels.": 1,
    " No limitations.": 1,
    " my ability and my potential.": 1,
    "And they decided to tell me that I could see.": 1,
    " So just like Johnny Cash's Sue.": 1,
    " a boy giving a girl's name.": 1,
    "I would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive when they were no longer there to protect me or just take it all away.": 1,
    " But more significantly, they gave me the ability to believe.": 1,
    " totally to believe that I could.": 1,
    "And so when I heard that eye specialist tell me all the things a big fat no": 1,
    " Everybody imagines I was devastated and don't get me wrong because when I first heard it aside from the fact that the whole is insane I got that thump in my chest do that Huh": 1,
    " but very quickly I recovered.": 1,
    "It was like that.": 1,
    "The first thing I could think about was my mom, who was crying over beside me.": 1,
    " And I swear to God, I walked out of his office, I will drive.": 1,
    "I will drive.": 1,
    "You're mad, I'll drive.": 1,
    "I know I can drive.": 1,
    " And with the same dog of determination that my father had bred into me since I was such a child, he taught me how to sail knowing I could never see where I was going, I could never see the shore.": 1,
    " and I couldn't see the sail, and I couldn't see the destination, but he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face.": 1,
    " And that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and I would drive and for the next 11 years I swore nobody would ever find out that I couldn't see because I didn't want to be a failure and I didn't want to be weak and I believed": 1,
    " I could do it.": 1,
    "So I rammed through life as only a case you can do.": 1,
    "And I was an archaeologist, and then I broke things.": 1,
    "And then I managed a restaurant, and then I slipped and things.": 1,
    "And then I was a masseuse.": 1,
    "And then I was a landscape gardener.": 1,
    "And then I went to business school.": 1,
    "And you know, disabled people are hugely educated.": 1,
    " And then I went in and I got a global consulting job with Accenture and they didn't even know.": 1,
    " And it's extraordinary how far belief can take you.": 1,
    " in 1999, two and a half years into that job.": 1,
    " Something happened.": 1,
    "Wonderfully, my eyes decided, enough.": 1,
    " and temporarily, and very unexpectedly, they dropped.": 1,
    " And I'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world where you work hard, play hard, you gotta be the best, you gotta be the best.": 1,
    " And two years in, I really could see very little.": 1,
    " And I found myself in front of a HR manager in 1999 saying something I never imagined that I would say.": 1,
    "I was 28 years old.": 1,
    "I had built a persona all around what I could and couldn't do.": 1,
    " And I simply said,": 1,
    " I'm sorry.": 1,
    " I can't see.": 1,
    " and I need help.": 1,
    " Asking for help can be incredibly difficult.": 1,
    "And you all know what it is.": 1,
    "You don't need to have a disability to know that.": 1,
    "You all know how hard it is to admit weakness and failure.": 1,
    "And it's frightening, isn't it?": 1,
    " But all that belief had fueled me so long.": 1,
    "And can I tell you, operating in a sighted world when you can't see, it's kind of difficult.": 1,
    "It really is.": 1,
    "Can I tell you, airports are a disaster.": 1,
    " Oh, and please, any designers out there?": 1,
    "Okay, designers, please put up your hands even though I can't even see you.": 1,
    "You know, I always end up in the gents' toilets.": 1,
    " And there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell, but can I just tell you, the little sign for a gent's toilet or a lady's toilet is determined by a triangle.": 1,
    "Have you ever tried to see that, if you had Vaseline in front of your eyes?": 1,
    " It's such a small thing, right?": 1,
    "And you know how exhausting it can be to try to be perfect?": 1,
    " when you're not, or to be somebody that you aren't.": 1,
    "And so after admitting I couldn't see to hate you, they sent me off to an eye specialist.": 1,
    "And I had no idea that this man was going to change my life.": 1,
    "But before I got to him, I was so lost.": 1,
    " No idea who it was anymore.": 1,
    "And that eye specialist, he didn't bother testing my eyes, God knows, it was therapy.": 1,
    "And he asked me several questions, of which many were, why, why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself?": 1,
    " And do you love what you do, Caroline?": 1,
    "And you know when you go to a global consulting firm, they put a chip in your head, and you're like, I love Accenture, I love Accenture, I love my job, I love Accenture, I love Accenture, I love Accenture, I love my job, I love Accenture.": 1,
    "To leave would be failure.": 1,
    " And he said, do you love it?": 1,
    "I couldn't even speak.": 1,
    "I was so choked up.": 1,
    "I just was so, how do I tell him?": 1,
    "And then he said to me, what do you want to be when you're little?": 1,
    " Now, listen, I wasn't going to say to him, well, I want to race cars and motorbikes.": 1,
    "Hardly appropriate at this moment in time.": 1,
    "He thought I was mad enough anyway.": 1,
    "And as I left his office, he called me back.": 1,
    "And he said, I think it's time.": 1,
    " I think it's time to stop fighting and do something different.": 1,
    "And that door closed.": 1,
    "And the silence just outside a doctor's office that many of us know.": 1,
    " And my chest aches, and I had no idea where I was going.": 1,
    "I had no idea, but I did know the game was up.": 1,
    "And I went home, and because the pain in my chest aches so much, I thought, oh god, will I go out for a run?": 1,
    "Really not a very sensible thing to do.": 1,
    " And I went on a run that I know so well.": 1,
    "I know this run so well by the back of my hand.": 1,
    "I always run it perfectly fine.": 1,
    "I count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with.": 1,
    " And there was a rock that I've always missed and I've never fallen on it, never.": 1,
    "And there I was crying away and smash bash on my rock, broken, fallen.": 1,
    " over on this rock in the middle of March in 2000, and typical Irish weather on a Wednesday, grey, snot, tears everywhere, ridiculously self-pitying, and I was floored, and I was broken, and I was angry.": 1,
    " And I didn't know what to do.": 1,
    "And I sat there for quite some time going, how am I going to get off this rock and go home?": 1,
    "Because who am I going to be?": 1,
    "What am I going to be?": 1,
    " And I thought about my dad and I thought, good God, I'm so not soon out.": 1,
    " And I kept thinking over my mind, what had happened?": 1,
    "Where did it go wrong?": 1,
    "Why didn't I understand?": 1,
    "And you know, the extraordinary part of it is I just simply had no answers.": 1,
    "I had lost my belief.": 1,
    "Look where my belief had brought me to.": 1,
    "And now I had lost it.": 1,
    "And now I really couldn't see.": 1,
    " I was crumpled.": 1,
    "And then I remember thinking about that eye specialist asking me, what do you want to be?": 1,
    "Do you like it?": 1,
    "What do you want to be when you're little?": 1,
    "Do you love what you do?": 1,
    " And really slowly, slowly, slowly.": 1,
    " It happened.": 1,
    "And it did happen this way.": 1,
    " And then the minute it came, it blew up in my head and bashed in my heart.": 1,
    "Something different.": 1,
    "Well, how about Mowgli from The Jungle Book?": 1,
    " you don't get more different than that.": 1,
    " and the moment, and I mean the moment.": 1,
    " The moment that hit me, I swear to God, it was like, woo-hoo, you know?": 1,
    "Something to believe in.": 1,
    "And nobody can tell me no.": 1,
    "Yes, you can say I can't be an archaeologist, but you can tell me no, I can't be Mowgli, because guess what?": 1,
    "Nobody has ever done it before.": 1,
    " So I'm going to go do it.": 1,
    "And it doesn't matter whether I'm a boy or a girl.": 1,
    "I'm just going to scoot.": 1,
    "And so I got off that rock.": 1,
    "And oh my god, did I run home.": 1,
    "And I sprinted home.": 1,
    "And I didn't fall.": 1,
    "And I didn't crash.": 1,
    "And I ran up the stairs.": 1,
    "And there's one of my favorite books of all time.": 1,
    "Travels on my Elf and by Mark Sand.": 1,
    "I don't know if any of you know it.": 1,
    " And I grab this book off and I'm sitting on the couch and I'm going, I know what I'm going to do.": 1,
    "I know how to be Mowgli.": 1,
    "I'm going to go across India on the back of an elephant.": 1,
    "I'm going to be an elephant handler.": 1,
    " And I had no idea how I was going to be an elephant handler from global management consultant to elephant handler.": 1,
    " I had no idea how, I had no idea how you're hiring Elf and getting Elf, and I don't speak Hindi, I've never been to India, had no clue, but I knew I would.": 1,
    " Because when you make a decision at the right time in the right place, God, that universe makes it happen for you.": 1,
    "Nine months later after that day on Snot Rock, I had the only blind date in my life with a seven and a half foot elephant called Kanchi.": 1,
    " And together we would trek 1,000 kilometers across India.": 1,
    " The most powerful thing of all is it's not that I didn't achieve before then, oh my god I did, but you know what, I was believing in the wrong thing because I wasn't believing in me, really me, all the bits of me.": 1,
    " All the bits of all of us, do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we're not?": 1,
    "And you know what, when you really believe in yourself and everything about you, it's extraordinary what happens.": 1,
    "And you know what, that trip, that thousand kilometers, it raised enough money for 6,000 cataract eye operations.": 1,
    " 6,000 people got to see because of that.": 1,
    "When I came home off that elephant, do you know the most amazing part was I jacked in my job in Accenture.": 1,
    " I left and I became a social entrepreneur and I set up an organization with Mark Shand called Elephant Foundry which deals with Asian Elephant Conservation and I set up Canty.": 1,
    " because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant because disabilities like the elephant in the room.": 1,
    "And I wanted to make you see it in a positive way.": 1,
    "No charity, no pity, but I wanted to work": 1,
    " only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting and possible.": 1,
    " It was extraordinary, you know?": 1,
    "That's what I wanted to do.": 1,
    "And I never thought about nose anymore and not seeing any of that kind of mad thing.": 1,
    "It just seemed that it was possible.": 1,
    " And you know, the oddest part is, when I was on my way traveling here to TED, I'll be honest, I was perturbed.": 1,
    "And I speak, but this is an amazing audience.": 1,
    " And what am I doing here?": 1,
    "But as I was traveling here, you'll be very happy to know I did use my white symbol stick cane, because it's really good to skip queues in the airport.": 1,
    "And I got my way here.": 1,
    " being happily proud that I couldn't see.": 1,
    "And the one thing is that a really good friend of mine, he text me on the way over, knowing that I was scared.": 1,
    "Even though I present confident I was scared, he said, be you.": 1,
    " And so here I am.": 1,
    " This is me.": 1,
    " All of me.": 1,
    " And I have learned that, you know what, cars and motorbikes and elephants, that's not freedom.": 1,
    " Being absolutely, truly yourself is freedom.": 1,
    "And I never needed eyes to see.": 1,
    "Never.": 1,
    "I simply needed vision and belief.": 1,
    "And if you truly believe, and I mean believe from the bottom of your heart,": 1,
    " You can make change happen.": 1,
    "And we need to make it happen.": 1,
    "Because every single one of us, woman, man, gay, straight, disabled, perfect, normal, whatever.": 1,
    " Every one of us must be the very best of ourselves.": 1,
    "I no longer want anybody to be invisible.": 1,
    "We all have to be included and stop with the labels, the limiting of labels.": 1,
    " Because we are not jam jars.": 1,
    "We are extraordinarily different, wonderful people.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
