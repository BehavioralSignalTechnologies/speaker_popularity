    " A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut, so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock, and try something new for 30 days.": 1,
    " The idea is actually pretty simple.": 1,
    "Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days.": 1,
    " It turns out 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit like watching the news from your life.": 1,
    "There's a few things that I learned while doing these 30-day challenges.": 1,
    " The first was, instead of the months flying by forgotten, the time was much more memorable.": 1,
    " This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month.": 1,
    "And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day.": 1,
    " I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges, my self-confidence grew.": 1,
    "I went from desk dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work for fun.": 1,
    " Even last year, I ended up hiking up Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa.": 1,
    "I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges.": 1,
    " I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough, you can do anything for 30 days.": 1,
    " Have you ever wanted to write a novel?": 1,
    " Every November, tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50,000-word novel from scratch in 30 days.": 1,
    "It turns out all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month.": 1,
    " So I did.": 1,
    "By the way, the secret is not to go to sleep until you've written your words for the day.": 1,
    "You might be sleep deprived, but you'll finish your novel.": 1,
    " Now, is my book the next great American novel?": 1,
    "No!": 1,
    "I wrote it in a month!": 1,
    "It's awful!": 1,
    " But for the rest of my life, if I meet John Hodgman at a Ted party, I don't have to say, I'm a computer scientist.": 1,
    "No, no.": 1,
    "If I want to, I can say, I'm a novelist.": 1,
    " So here's one last thing I'd like to mention.": 1,
    "I learned that when I made small, sustainable changes, things I could keep doing, they were more likely to stick.": 1,
    " There's nothing wrong with big crazy challenges.": 1,
    "In fact, they're a ton of fun, but they're less likely to stick.": 1,
    " When I gave up sugar for 30 days, day 31 looked like this.": 1,
    " So here's my question to you.": 1,
    "What are you waiting for?": 1,
    "I guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not.": 1,
    " So why not think about something you have always wanted to try?": 1,
    "And give it a shot for the next 30 days.": 1,
    "Thanks.": 1
