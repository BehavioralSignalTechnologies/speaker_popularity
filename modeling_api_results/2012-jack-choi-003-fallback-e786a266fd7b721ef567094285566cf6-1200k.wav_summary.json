    " You know, cadaver dissection is the traditional way of learning human anatomy.": 1,
    "For students, it's quite an experience, but for school, it could be very difficult or expensive to maintain.": 1,
    " So we learned the majority of anatomy class taught, they do not have Cardeva dissection lab.": 1,
    "Maybe those reasons, or depending on where you are,": 1,
    " Codeva may not be easily available.": 1,
    "So to address this, we developed with Dr. Brown in Stanford.": 1,
    " virtual dissection table.": 1,
    "So we call this anatomage table.": 1,
    "So with this anatomage table,": 1,
    " Students can experience the dissection without human cadaver.": 1,
    "And the table form is important.": 1,
    " Since it's touch interactive, just like the way they do dissection in the lab, or furthermore, just the way a surgeon operates a patient, you can naturally interact with your table.": 1,
    " Our digital body is one-to-one life size.": 1,
    "So this is exactly the way students would see the real anatomy.": 1,
    " I'm going to do some demonstration.": 1,
    " As you can see, I use my finger to interact with my digital body.": 1,
    " I'm going to do some cut.": 1,
    "I can cut any way I want to.": 1,
    "So I cut right here.": 1,
    " Then it's going to show inside.": 1,
    " And I can change my cut to three different parts.": 1,
    " Maybe I can cut there, see the brain.": 1,
    " And I can change my cut.": 1,
    "You can see some internal organs.": 1,
    " So we call this miss slicer mode.": 1,
    " Okay, I'm going to do another cut.": 1,
    " Right there.": 1,
    " It shows a lot of internal structures.": 1,
    " If I want to see the back side, I can flip.": 1,
    " And sit from behind.": 1,
    " Like this.": 1,
    " So if these images are uncomfortable to you or disturbing to you,": 1,
    " That means we did the right job.": 1,
    "So our doctor said, these are eye candies.": 1,
    " So instead of just butchering the body, I'd like to do more clinically meaningful dissection.": 1,
    "What I'm going to do is I'm going to peel off all the skins, muscles, and bones.": 1,
    " just to see a few internal organs.": 1,
    " Right here.": 1,
    " Let's say I'm going to cut the liver right here.": 1,
    " OK.": 1,
    "So let's say I'm interested in looking at heart.": 1,
    " I'm going to do some surgery here, just like I'm going to cut some veins, arteries.": 1,
    " You don't want to hear oops in real surgery.": 1,
    " But fortunately, our digital man has Undo.": 1,
    " Okay.": 1,
    " All right, let me zoom in.": 1,
    " I'm gonna make cut right there.": 1,
    " And then you can see the inside of heart.": 1,
    "You can see atrium and ventricles, how blood flows to artery and veins.": 1,
    " Just like this, students can isolate anybody and dissect any way you want to.": 1,
    "It doesn't have to be always dissection.": 1,
    "Since it's digital, we can do reverse dissection.": 1,
    " So let me show you.": 1,
    "I'm going to start with a skeletal structure.": 1,
    "And I can add a few internal organs.": 1,
    " Maybe I can add quickly this way.": 1,
    " And I can build muscles gradually.": 1,
    " Just like that, we can see tendons and muscles.": 1,
    " Wish I could build my muscle this fast.": 1,
    " And this is another way to learn anatomy.": 1,
    " Another thing I can show you is, more often than not, doctors get to meet patients in x-ray form.": 1,
    " So.": 1,
    " Anatomage table shows exactly how anatomy will appear in X-ray.": 1,
    " And you can also interact with the UX, right?": 1,
    " Also, if you want, you can compare with how anatomy would appear in X-ray too.": 1,
    " So when you're done, just bring back the body.": 1,
    " and then it's ready for another session.": 1,
    "Looks like our table also can transform gender, too.": 1,
    "It's a female now.": 1,
    "So this is Anatomage table.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
