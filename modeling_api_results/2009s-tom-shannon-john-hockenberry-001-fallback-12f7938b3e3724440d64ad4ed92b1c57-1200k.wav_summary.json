    "Yeah.": 3,
    "No.": 2,
    " It's great to be here with you, Tom, and I want to start with a question that has just been consuming me since I first became familiar with your work.": 1,
    "In your work, there's always this kind of hybrid quality of a natural force": 1,
    " in some sort of interplay with creative force.": 1,
    "Are they ever in equilibrium in the way that you see your work?": 1,
    " Yeah, the subject matter that I'm looking for, it's usually to solve a question, like I had the question popped into my head, what does the cone that connects the sun and the earth look like, if you could connect the two spheres.": 1,
    " and in proportion.": 1,
    "What would the sphere, the size of the sphere and the length and what would the taper be to the earth?": 1,
    "And so I went about and": 1,
    " made that sculpture turning it out of solid bronze and I did one that was about 35 feet long.": 1,
    " The sun end was about four inches in diameter and then it tapered over about 35 feet to about a millimeter at the earth end.": 1,
    "And so for me it was really exciting just to see": 1,
    " what it looks like if you could step outside into a larger context as though you were an astronaut and see these two things as an object because they are so intimately bound.": 1,
    "One is meaningless without the other.": 1,
    " Is there a relief in playing with these forces?": 1,
    "And I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is in playing with these forces.": 1,
    "Well, like the magnetically levitated objects, like that silver one there.": 1,
    " That was the result of hundreds of experiments with magnets trying to find a way to make something float and with the least possible connection to the ground.": 1,
    "So I got it down to just one tether to be able to support the": 1,
    " Is this electromagnetic here, or are these static?": 1,
    "Those are permanent magnets.": 1,
    "Because if the power went out, it'd just be a big noise.": 1,
    " It's really, it's unsatisfactory having to plug in art.": 1,
    "I agree, I agree.": 1,
    "The magnetic works are...": 1,
    " combination of gravity and magnetism.": 1,
    "So it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces that influence everything.": 1,
    " the sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the planets and and the earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun so there's this huge kind of": 1,
    " invisible shape structures that magnetism takes in the universe.": 1,
    "But with the pendulum,": 1,
    " It allows me to manifest these invisible forces that are holding the magnets up.": 1,
    " Sculptures are normally very simplified.": 1,
    "I try to refine them down to very simple forms.": 1,
    " But the paintings become very complex because I think the fields that are supporting them, they're billowing and they're interpenetrating and there are interference patterns.": 1,
    " And they're non-deterministic.": 1,
    "I mean, you don't know necessarily where you're headed when you begin, even though the forces can be calculated.": 1,
    "So the evolution of this, I gather this isn't your first pendulum.": 1,
    " The first one I did was in the late 70s and I just had a simple cone with a spigot at the bottom of it.": 1,
    " I threw it into an orbit and it only had one color and when it got to the center, the paint kept running out, so I had to run in there.": 1,
    "I didn't have any control over the spigot remotely.": 1,
    " So that told me right away I needed a remote control device.": 1,
    "But then I started dreaming of having six colors.": 1,
    "I sort of think about it as the DNA, these colors, the red, blue, yellow, the primary colors in white and black.": 1,
    " if you put them together in different combinations just like printing in a sense like how a magazine color is printed and put them under certain forces which is orbiting them or": 1,
    " passing them back and forth or drawing with them.": 1,
    "These amazing things started to appear.": 1,
    "It looks like we're loaded for bear here.": 1,
    "Well, let's put a couple of canvases.": 1,
    "I'll ask a couple of my sons to set up the canvases here.": 1,
    " I wanted to say that this is Jack, Nick, and Louis.": 1,
    "Thanks, guys.": 1,
    " Okay, so here are the... All right, I'll get out of the way here.": 1,
    "I'm just going to throw this into an orbit and see if I can paint everybody's shoes in the front.": 1,
    " That is...": 1,
    " Ho ho ho, nice.": 1,
    " So something like this, I'm doing this as a demo and it's more playful, but inevitably,": 1,
    " All of this can be used.": 1,
    "I can redeem this painting just continuing on doing layers upon layers and I keep it around for a couple weeks.": 1,
    " contemplating it and I'll do another session with it and bring it up to another level where all of this kind of becomes the background, the depth of it.": 1,
    " So the valves at the bottom of those tubes there are like radio control airplane valves.": 1,
    "Yes, there are servos with cams that pinch these rubber tubes and they can pinch them very tight and stop it or you can have them wide open.": 1,
    " And all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom.": 1,
    "You can always be changing colors, put aluminum paint, or I could put anything into this.": 1,
    "It could be, you know...": 1,
    " tomato sauce or anything could be dispensed, sand, powders or anything like that.": 1,
    "So many forces there.": 1,
    "You've got gravity, you've got the centrifugal force, you've got the fluid dynamics.": 1,
    " Each of these beautiful paintings, are they...": 1,
    " images in and of themselves or are they records of a physical event called the pendulum approaching the canvas?": 1,
    " Well, this painting here, I wanted to do something very simple, a simple iconic image of two ripples interfering.": 1,
    "So the one on the right was done first.": 1,
    " And then the one on the left was done over it.": 1,
    "And then I left gaps so you could see the one that was done before.": 1,
    "And then when I did the second one,": 1,
    " it really disturbed the piece, these big blue lines crashing through the center of it.": 1,
    "So it created a kind of a tension and an overlap.": 1,
    "There are lines in front of": 1,
    " the one on the right and there are lines behind the one on the left and so it takes it into different planes.": 1,
    " It's also about just the little events, the events of the interpenetration of": 1,
    " Two things that happen, there's an interference pattern, and then a third thing happens.": 1,
    "There are shapes that come about just by the marriage of two events that are happening, and I'm interested in that.": 1,
    " I'm very interested in that, like the occurrence of moray patterns.": 1,
    "Like this green one, this is a painting I did about": 1,
    " ten years ago.": 1,
    "But it has some, say in the upper third, there are these mores and interference patterns that are radio kind of imagery.": 1,
    " That's something that in painting I've never seen done.": 1,
    "I've never seen a representation of kind of a radio interference patterns which are": 1,
    " so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives.": 1,
    "Is that a literal part of the image, or is my eye completing that interference pattern?": 1,
    " The paint actually makes it real.": 1,
    "It's really manifested there.": 1,
    "If I throw a very concentric circle or concentric ellipse, it just dutifully makes these": 1,
    " evenly spaced lines which get closer and closer together which describes how gravity works.": 1,
    "There's something very appealing about the exactitude of science that": 1,
    " that I really enjoy and I love the shapes that I see in scientific observations and apparatus.": 1,
    " The especially astronomical forms and the idea of the vastness of it, the scale, is very interesting to me.": 1,
    " My focus in recent years has kind of shifted more toward biology.": 1,
    "Some of these paintings, when you look at them very close, they're": 1,
    " Odd things appear that really look like horses or birds or crocodiles, elephants.": 1,
    "There are lots of things that appear when you look into it.": 1,
    "It's sort of like looking at cloud patterns.": 1,
    " Sometimes they're very modeled and highly rendered.": 1,
    "And then there are all these forms that we don't know what they are, but they are equally well resolved and complex.": 1,
    " So I think, conceivably, those could be predictive, because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we're familiar with in biology,": 1,
    " It's also making other forms that we're not familiar with and maybe it's the kind of forms that we'll discover underneath the surface of Mars where there are probably lakes with": 1,
    " fish swimming under the surface.": 1,
    "Oh, let's hope so.": 1,
    "Oh, my God, let's.": 1,
    "Oh, please.": 1,
    "Yes.": 1,
    "I'm convinced that we're going to find them.": 1,
    "Oh, I'm so there.": 1,
    "You know, it seems that": 1,
    " At this stage in your life, you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of dissonant": 1,
    " I suppose it's an electromagnetic force that somehow governs your Parkinson's and this creative force that is both the": 1,
    " the artist who is in the here and now in this sort of arc of your whole life.": 1,
    "Is that relevant to your work?": 1,
    "As it turns out, this": 1,
    " This device kind of comes in handy because I don't have to have the fine motor skills to do that.": 1,
    "I can operate slide switches and it's more of a mental process.": 1,
    "I'm looking at it and making decisions": 1,
    " It needs more red.": 1,
    "It needs more blue.": 1,
    "It needs a different shape.": 1,
    "And so I make these creative decisions.": 1,
    " and can execute them in a much, much simpler way.": 1,
    "I mean, I got the symptoms.": 1,
    "I guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years, but at a certain point, you start seeing the symptoms.": 1,
    "And in my case, I": 1,
    " my left hand has a significant tremor in my left leg also and I'm left-handed and so I draw": 1,
    " all my creations really start on small drawings, which I have thousands of, and it's my way of just thinking.": 1,
    " a simple pencil and at first the Parkinson's was really upsetting because I couldn't get the pencil to stand still.": 1,
    " So you're not a gatekeeper for these forces.": 1,
    "You don't think of yourself as the master of these forces.": 1,
    "You think of yourself as the servant.": 1,
    " nature is like, well it's a godsend, it just has so much in it.": 1,
    "I think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature, humans are": 1,
    " of the universe.": 1,
    "The universe is in our mind and our minds are in the universe and we are": 1,
    " expressions of the universe, basically, as humans.": 1,
    "Ultimately, being part of the universe, we're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of": 1,
    " the constituency of the universe and to interface with it with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere": 1,
    " act and show what they can do, giving them pigment and paint, just like an artist.": 1,
    " It's a good ally.": 1,
    "It's a terrific studio assistant.": 1,
    "Well, I love the idea that somewhere within this idea of fine motion and control": 1,
    " with the traditional skills that you have with your hand, some sort of more elemental force gets revealed.": 1,
    "And that's, I think, the beauty here.": 1,
    "Tom, thanks so much.": 1,
    "It's been really, really great.": 1,
    "Thank you, John.": 1
