    " So when I do my job, people hate me.": 1,
    " In fact, the better I do my job, the more people hate me.": 1,
    "And no, I'm not a meter maid, and I'm not an undertaker.": 1,
    "I am a progressive lesbian talking head on Fox News.": 1,
    " So y'all heard that, right?": 1,
    "Just to make sure, right?": 1,
    "I am a gay talking head on Fox News.": 1,
    "I'm going to tell you how I do it and the most important thing I've learned.": 1,
    " So I go on television.": 1,
    "I debate people who literally want to obliterate everything I believe in, in some cases who don't want me and people like me to even exist.": 1,
    " It's sort of like Thanksgiving with your conservative uncle on steroids with a live television audience of millions.": 1,
    "It's totally almost just like that.": 1,
    " And that's just on air.": 1,
    "The hate mail I get is unbelievable.": 1,
    "Last week alone, I got 238 pieces of nasty email.": 1,
    " and more hate tweets than I can even count.": 1,
    "I was called an idiot, a traitor, a scourge, a cunt, and an ugly man, and that was just in one email.": 1,
    " So what have I realized being on the receiving end of all this ugliness?": 1,
    "Well, my biggest takeaway is that for decades we've been focused on political correctness.": 1,
    " But what matters more is emotional correctness.": 1,
    "Let me give you a small example.": 1,
    "I don't care if you call me a dyke.": 1,
    "I really don't.": 1,
    "I care about two things.": 1,
    "One, I care that you spell it right.": 1,
    " Just quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E.": 1,
    "You'd totally be surprised.": 1,
    " And second, I don't care about the word, I care about how you use it.": 1,
    "Are you being friendly?": 1,
    "Are you just being naive?": 1,
    "Or do you really want to hurt me personally?": 1,
    " Emotional correctness is the tone, the feeling, how we say what we say, the respect and compassion we show one another.": 1,
    " And what I've realized is that political persuasion doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data.": 1,
    "Political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct.": 1,
    " So when I first went to go work at Fox News, true confession, I expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle dragging, right?": 1,
    " That, by the way, in case you're paying attention, is not emotionally correct.": 1,
    "But liberals on my side, we can be self-righteous, we can be condescending, we can be dismissive of anyone who doesn't agree with us.": 1,
    " In other words, we can be politically right, but emotionally wrong.": 1,
    " And incidentally, that means that people don't like us, right?": 1,
    " Now here's the kicker.": 1,
    "Conservatives are really nice.": 1,
    "I mean, not all of them, and not the ones who send me hate mail.": 1,
    "But you would be surprised.": 1,
    "Sean Hannity is one of the sweetest guys I've ever met.": 1,
    " He spends his free time trying to fix up his staff on blind dates.": 1,
    "And I know that if I ever had a problem, he would do anything he could to help.": 1,
    " Now, I think Sean Hannity is 99% politically wrong, but his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive.": 1,
    "And that's why people listen to him.": 1,
    "Because you can't get anyone to agree with you if they don't even listen to you first.": 1,
    " We spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements.": 1,
    "And if we can start to find compassion for one another, then we have a shot at building common ground.": 1,
    " It actually sounds really hokey to sort of say it standing up here.": 1,
    "But when you try to put it in practice, it's really powerful.": 1,
    " So someone who says they hate immigrants, I try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they've always known.": 1,
    "Or someone who says they don't like teachers unions.": 1,
    " I bet they're really devastated to see their kids' school going into the gutter and they're just looking for someone to blame.": 1,
    " Our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us.": 1,
    "That is emotional correctness.": 1,
    " I'm not saying it's easy.": 1,
    "An average of like 5.6 times per day, I have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities.": 1,
    " This whole finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a political spiritual practice for me.": 1,
    " and I ain't the Dalai Lama.": 1,
    "I'm not perfect, but what I am is optimistic.": 1,
    " because I don't just get hate mail.": 1,
    "I get a lot of really nice letters, lots of them.": 1,
    "And one of my all time favorites begins, I'm not a big fan of your political leanings or your sometimes tortured logic.": 1,
    " but I'm a big fan of you as a person.": 1,
    " Now, this guy doesn't agree with me.": 1,
    "Yet.": 1,
    " But he's listening.": 1,
    "Not because of what I said, but because of how I said it.": 1,
    "And somehow, even though we've never met, we've managed to form a connection.": 1,
    " That's emotional correctness.": 1,
    "And that's how we start the conversations that really lead to change.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
