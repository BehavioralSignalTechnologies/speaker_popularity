    " When my first children's book was published in 2001, I returned to my old elementary school to talk to the students about being an author and an illustrator.": 1,
    "And when I was setting up my slide projector in the cafeteria,": 1,
    " I looked across the room and there she was, my old lunch lady.": 1,
    "She was still there at the school and she was busily preparing lunches for the day.": 1,
    " So I approached her to say hello and I said, hi, Jeannie, how are you?": 1,
    "And she looked at me and I could tell that she recognized me, but she couldn't quite place me.": 1,
    "And she looked at me and she said, Steven Krasowska?": 1,
    " And I was amazed that she knew I was a Krasowska, but Steven is my uncle who is 20 years older than I am.": 1,
    "And she had been his lunch lady when he was a kid.": 1,
    "And she started telling me about her grandkids and": 1,
    " That blew my mind.": 1,
    "My lunch lady had grandkids and therefore kids and therefore left school at the end of the day.": 1,
    "I thought she lived in the cafeteria with the serving spoons.": 1,
    "I had never thought about any of that before.": 1,
    " Well, that chance encounter inspired my imagination, and I created the Lunch Lady graphic novel series.": 1,
    "A series of comics about a lunch lady who uses her fish stick nunchucks to fight off evil cyborg substitutes.": 1,
    " school bus monster and mutant mathletes and at the end of every book they get the bad guy with their hairnet and they proclaim justice is served": 1,
    " And it's been amazing because the series was so welcomed into the reading lives of children and they send me the most amazing letters and cards and artwork and I would notice as I would visit schools": 1,
    " the lunch staff would be involved in the programming in a very meaningful way.": 1,
    "And coast to coast, all of the lunch ladies told me the same thing.": 1,
    "Thank you for making a superhero in our likeness.": 1,
    " Because the lunch lady has not been treated very kindly in popular culture over time.": 1,
    "But it meant the most to Jeannie.": 1,
    "When the books were first published, I invited her to the book launch party.": 1,
    " And in front of everyone she had fed over the years, I gave her a piece of artwork and some books.": 1,
    "And two years after this photo was taken, she passed away.": 1,
    " and I attended her wake and nothing could have prepared me for what I saw there.": 1,
    "Because next to her casket was this painting.": 1,
    "And her husband told me it meant so much to her that I had acknowledged her hard work": 1,
    " I had validated what she did.": 1,
    "And that inspired me to create a day where we could recreate that feeling in cafeterias across the country.": 1,
    " School lunch hero day a day where kids can make creative projects for their lunch staff and I partnered with the school nutrition Association and did you know that a little over 30 million kids participate in school lunch programs every day and": 1,
    " That equals up to a little over five billion lunches made every school year.": 1,
    "And the stories of heroism go well beyond just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets on their lunch tray.": 1,
    " There is Miss Brenda in California who keeps a close eye on every student that comes through her line and then reports back to the guidance counselor if anything is amiss.": 1,
    " There are the lunch ladies in Kentucky who realized that 67% of their students relied on those meals every day and they were going without food over the summer.": 1,
    "So they retrofitted a school bus to create a mobile feeding unit and they travel around the neighborhoods feeding 500 kids a day.": 1,
    " And kids made the most amazing projects.": 1,
    "I knew they would.": 1,
    "Kids made hamburger cards that were made out of construction paper.": 1,
    " They took photos of their lunch lady's head and plastered onto my cartoon lunch lady, affixed that to a milk carton, and presented them with flowers.": 1,
    " And they made their own comics starring the cartoon lunch lady alongside their actual lunch ladies.": 1,
    "And they made thank you pizzas, where every kid signed a different topping of a construction paper pizza.": 1,
    " For me, I was so moved by the response that came from the lunch ladies.": 1,
    "Because one woman said to me, she said, before this day, I felt like I was at the end of the planet at this school.": 1,
    " I didn't think that anyone noticed us down here.": 1,
    "Another woman said to me, you know, what I got out of this is that what I do is important.": 1,
    " And of course, what she does is important.": 1,
    "What they all do is important.": 1,
    "They're feeding our children every single day.": 1,
    "And before a child can learn, their belly needs to be full.": 1,
    " And these women and men are working on the front lines to create an educated society.": 1,
    "So I hope...": 1,
    " that you don't wait for school lunch here a day to say thank you to your lunch staff and I hope that you remember how powerful a thank you can be.": 1,
    "A thank you can change a life.": 1,
    "It changes the life of the person who receives it.": 1,
    " and it changes the life of the person who expresses it.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
