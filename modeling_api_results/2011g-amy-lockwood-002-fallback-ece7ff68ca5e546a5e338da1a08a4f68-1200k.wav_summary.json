    " I am a reformed marketer and I now work in international development.": 1,
    "In October, I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is the largest country in Africa.": 1,
    " In fact, it's as large as Western Europe, but it only has 300 miles of paved roads.": 1,
    "The DRC is a dangerous place.": 1,
    "In the past 10 years, 5 million people have died due to a war in the East.": 1,
    " But war isn't the only reason that life is difficult in the DRC.": 1,
    "There are many health issues as well.": 1,
    " In fact, the HIV prevalence rate is 1.3% among adults.": 1,
    "This might not sound like a large number, but in a country with 76 million people, it means that there are 930,000 that are infected.": 1,
    " And due to the poor infrastructure, only 25% of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need.": 1,
    "Which is why, in part, donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost.": 1,
    " And so while I was in the DRC, I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms.": 1,
    " including Damien.": 1,
    "Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa.": 1,
    "It's a hotel that's only open until midnight, so it's not a place that you stay, but it is a place where sex workers and their clients come.": 1,
    " Now Damien knows all about condoms, but he doesn't sell them.": 1,
    "He said there's just not demand.": 1,
    "It's not surprising, because only 3% of people in the DRC use condoms.": 1,
    " Joseph and Christine, who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms, said, despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low and no cost and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them,": 1,
    " Their customers don't buy the branded versions.": 1,
    "They like the generics.": 1,
    "And as a marketer, I found that curious.": 1,
    "And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like.": 1,
    " And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms.": 1,
    "Fear, financing, and fidelity.": 1,
    " They name the condoms things like Vive, to live, or trust.": 1,
    "They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV, put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them,": 1,
    " Show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently.": 1,
    " Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom.": 1,
    " What is it that you think about just before you go to condom?": 1,
    " Sex!": 1,
    "And the private companies that sell condoms in these places, they understand this.": 1,
    "Their marketing is slightly different.": 1,
    "The name might not be much different, but the imagery sure is.": 1,
    " Some brands are aspirational.": 1,
    " And certainly, the packaging is incredibly provocative.": 1,
    "And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing, understanding who is the audience.": 1,
    " And for donor agencies, unfortunately, the audience tends to be people that aren't even in the country they're working.": 1,
    "It's people back home, people that support their work, people like these.": 1,
    " But if what we're really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV, we need to think about the customer, the people whose behavior needs to change, the couples.": 1,
    " the young women, the young men whose lives depend on it.": 1,
    " And so the lesson is this.": 1,
    "It doesn't really matter what you're selling.": 1,
    "You just have to think about who is your customer and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior.": 1,
    "It might just save their lives.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
