    " Um.": 2,
    " You know, this is your conference.": 1,
    "And I think you have a right to know a little bit right now in this transition period about this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for a bit.": 1,
    "So I'm just going to grab a chair here.": 1,
    " You know, two years ago at TED,": 1,
    " I think I've come to this conclusion.": 1,
    "I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion.": 1,
    " I think that I may have believed unconsciously then that": 1,
    " I was kind of a business hero.": 1,
    " I had this company that I'd spent 15 years building.": 1,
    "It's called Future.": 1,
    "It's a magazine publishing company.": 1,
    "It had recently gone public.": 1,
    "And the market said that it was apparently worth $2 billion, a number I didn't really understand.": 1,
    " A magazine I recently launched called Business 2.0 was fatter than a telephone directory, busy pumping hot air into the bubble.": 1,
    " And I was the 40% owner of a dot com that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more.": 1,
    " And, you know, all this had come from nothing.": 1,
    "15 years earlier I was a science journalist who people just laughed at when I said, you know, I really would like to start my own computer magazine.": 1,
    " And 15 years later, there are 100 of them, and 2,000 people and stuff.": 1,
    "And it was just such heady times.": 1,
    "The date was...": 1,
    " February 2000, I thought the little graph of my business life that kind of looked a bit like Moore's law, ever upward and to the right, was going to go on forever.": 1,
    "I mean, it had to, right?": 1,
    " I was in for quite a surprise.": 1,
    " The .com, ironically called Snowball, was the very last consumer web company to go public the next month before NASDAQ exploded.": 1,
    " And I entered 18 months of business hell.": 1,
    " Everything that I'd built, crumbling, and it looked like all this stuff was going to die, and 15 years' work would have come for nothing.": 1,
    " And it was gut-wrenching.": 1,
    "It took eight years of blood, sweat and tears to reach 350 employees, something which I was very proud of in the business.": 1,
    " February 2001 in one day we laid off 350 people and Before the bloodshed was finished a thousand people had lost their jobs from for my companies": 1,
    " I felt sick.": 1,
    "I watched my own net worth falling by about a million dollars a day, every day, for 18 months.": 1,
    " And worse than that, far worse than that, you know, my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating.": 1,
    "I was going around with this big sign on my forehead, loser.": 1,
    " And you know, I think what disgusts me more than anything looking back is how the hell did I let my personal happiness get so tied up with this business thing?": 1,
    " Well, in the end, we were able to say future and snowball.": 1,
    "But I was at that point ready to move on and to cut a long story short, here's where I came to.": 1,
    " And the reason I'm telling this story is that I believe from many conversations that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of roller coaster, emotional roller coaster in the last couple of years.": 1,
    " This has been a big, big transition time.": 1,
    "And I believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us in taking us forward to the next stage, to whatever's next.": 1,
    " The theme next year is rebirth.": 1,
    "You know, it was at the same TED two years ago when Richard and I reached an agreement on the future of TED.": 1,
    " And at about the same time, and I think partly because of that, I started doing something that I'd forgotten about in my business focus.": 1,
    "I started to read again.": 1,
    " And I discovered that while I've been busy playing business games, there's been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest, cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology.": 1,
    " to anthropology.": 1,
    "All this stuff had changed and the way in which you could think about us as a species and us as a planet had just changed so much and it was incredibly exciting and what was really most exciting": 1,
    " And I think Richard Werman discovered this at least 20 years before I did, was that all this stuff is connected.": 1,
    "It's connected.": 1,
    "It all hooks into each other.": 1,
    " We talk about this a lot, and I thought about trying to give an example of this.": 1,
    "Just one example.": 1,
    "Madame de Gaulle, the wife of the French president, was famously asked once, what do you most desire?": 1,
    " And she answered, a penis.": 1,
    " And when you think about it, it's very true.": 1,
    "What we all most desire is happiness, as we say in English.": 1,
    " And something...": 1,
    " Good luck with that one in the Japanese translation room.": 1,
    " But something as basic as happiness, which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue.": 1,
    " You know, today it turns out that there's dozens of Ted-like questions that you can ask about it, which are really interesting.": 1,
    "You can ask about what causes it biochemically, neuroscience, serotonin, all that stuff.": 1,
    "You could ask, what are the psychological...": 1,
    " causes of it, you know, nature, nurture, current circumstance.": 1,
    "Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind blowing.": 1,
    " You can view it as a computing problem, an artificial intelligence problem.": 1,
    "Why, you know, do you need to incorporate some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly?": 1,
    " You can view it in sort of geopolitical terms and say, why is it that a billion people on this planet": 1,
    " are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness.": 1,
    "Whereas almost all the rest of them, regardless of how much money they have, whether it's $2 a day or whatever, are almost equally happy on average.": 1,
    " Or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing.": 1,
    "Did our genes invent this as a kind of trick to get us to behave in certain ways?": 1,
    " and its brain parasitized to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate.": 1,
    "Are we the victims of a mass delusion?": 1,
    "And so on and so on.": 1,
    "And these are, you know...": 1,
    " To understand even something as important to us as happiness, you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions.": 1,
    "And there's nowhere.": 1,
    " that I've discovered other than Ted, where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions.": 1,
    "And so it's the profound thing that Richard talks about, to understand anything": 1,
    " You just need to understand the little bits a little bit about everything that surrounds it.": 1,
    "And so gradually over these three days, you know, you start off kind of trying to figure out why am I listening to all this irrelevant stuff?": 1,
    "And at the end of the four days,": 1,
    " You know, your brain is humming and you feel energized and alive and excited.": 1,
    "And it's because all these different bits have been put together.": 1,
    "It's the total brain experience.": 1,
    "It's the mental equivalent of the full body massage.": 1,
    "Every mental organ addressed.": 1,
    " It really is.": 1,
    " Enough of the theory, Chris.": 1,
    "Tell us what you're actually going to do, all right?": 1,
    "So I will.": 1,
    "Here's the vision for Ted.": 1,
    "Number one, do nothing.": 1,
    "This thing ain't broke, so I ain't going to fix it.": 1,
    " I think Jeff Bezos kindly remarked to me, Chris, TED is a really great conference.": 1,
    "You're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad.": 1,
    " So you know.": 1,
    " I call myself, I gave myself the job title of Ted Custodian for a reason, and I will promise you right here and now that the core values that make Ted special are not going to be interfered with.": 1,
    "Truth.": 1,
    " curiosity, diversity.": 1,
    " No selling.": 1,
    "No corporate bullshit.": 1,
    " No bandwagoning, no platforms.": 1,
    " just the pursuit of interest wherever it lies, across all the disciplines that are represented here.": 1,
    "That's not going to be changed at all.": 1,
    " Number two, I am going to put together an incredible line up of speakers for next year.": 1,
    " The time scale on which TED operates is just fantastic after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines.": 1,
    "There's a year to do this.": 1,
    "And already, I hope to show you a bit later, there's 25 or so terrific speakers signed up for next year.": 1,
    " And I'm getting fantastic help from the community.": 1,
    "This is just such a great community.": 1,
    "And combined, our contacts reach pretty much everyone who's interesting in the country, if not the planet.": 1,
    "It's true.": 1,
    " Number three, I do want to, if I can, find a way of extending the TED experience throughout the year a little bit.": 1,
    "And one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club.": 1,
    " Books kind of saved me in the last couple of years.": 1,
    " You know, that's a gift that I would like to pass on.": 1,
    "So when you sign up for TED 2003, every six weeks you'll get a care package with a book or two and a reason why they linked to TED.": 1,
    " They may well be by a TED speaker.": 1,
    "And so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year, you know, having had the same intellectual emotional journey.": 1,
    "I think it will, I think it will be great.": 1,
    "I think it'll be great.": 1,
    " And then, fourthly, I want to mention the Sapling Foundation, which is the new owner of TED.": 1,
    "What Sapling's ownership means is that all of the proceeds of TED": 1,
    " will go towards the causes that something stands for.": 1,
    "And more important, I think, the ideas that": 1,
    " are exhibited and realised here.": 1,
    " are ideas that the foundation can use, because there's fantastic synergy.": 1,
    "Already, just in the last few days, we've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about, that they're passionate about, that can make a difference in the world.": 1,
    "And the idea of getting this group of people together": 1,
    " some of the causes that we believe in, the money that this conference can raise and the ideas.": 1,
    "I really believe that that combination will, over time, make a difference.": 1,
    "I'm incredibly excited about that.": 1,
    " In fact, I don't think overall that I've been as excited by anything ever in my life.": 1,
    "I'm in this for the long run.": 1,
    "And I would be greatly honored and excited if you'll come on this journey with me.": 1
