    " I'd like to start with a short story.": 1,
    "It's about a little boy whose father was a history buff.": 1,
    " and who used to take them by the hand to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis on the outskirts of their town.": 1,
    " They would always stop by to visit these huge winged bulls that used to guard the gates of that ancient metropolis.": 1,
    "And the boy used to be scared of these winged bulls, but at the same time they excited him.": 1,
    " And the dad used to use those bolts to tell the boy stories about that civilization and their work.": 1,
    " Let's fast forward to the San Francisco Bay Area many decades later, where I started a technology company that brought the world its first 3D laser scanning system.": 1,
    "Let me show you how it works.": 1,
    " Long-range laser scanning works by sending out a pulsed laser beam of light.": 1,
    "The system measures the beam's time of flight, recording the time it takes for the light to hit a surface and make its return.": 1,
    " With two mirrors, the scanner calculates the beam's horizontal and vertical angles, giving accurate X, Y, and Z coordinates.": 1,
    "The point is then recorded into a 3D visualization program.": 1,
    " All of this happens in seconds.": 1,
    " You could see here these systems are extremely fast.": 1,
    "They collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very high resolution.": 1,
    " A surveyor with traditional survey tools would be hard-pressed to produce maybe 500 points in a whole day.": 1,
    "These babies would be producing something like 10,000 points a second.": 1,
    " So as you can imagine, this was a paradigm shift in the survey and construction as well as in reality capture industry.": 1,
    " Approximately 10 years ago, my wife and I started a foundation to do good.": 1,
    "And right about that time, the magnificent Bamiyan Buddhas, 180 foot tall, in Afghanistan.": 1,
    " were blown up by the Taliban.": 1,
    "They were gone in an instant.": 1,
    "And unfortunately, there was no detailed documentation of these Buddhas.": 1,
    " This clearly devastated me and I couldn't help but wonder about the fate of my old friends, the winged bulls, and the fate of the many, many heritage sites all over the world.": 1,
    " Both my wife and I were so touched by this that we decided to expand the mission of our foundation to include digital heritage preservation of world sites.": 1,
    " We called the project CYARC, which stands for Cyber Archive.": 1,
    "To date, with the help of a global network of partners, we've completed close to 50 projects.": 1,
    "Let me show you some of them.": 1,
    "Chichen Itza.": 1,
    " Rapa Nui, and what you're seeing here are the Cloud of Points, Babylon, Rosalind Chapel,": 1,
    " Pompeii, and our latest project, Mount Rushmore, which happened to be one of our most challenging projects.": 1,
    "As you see here, we had to develop a special rig.": 1,
    " to bring the scanner up close and personal.": 1,
    " The results of our work in the field are used to produce media and deliverables to be used by conservators and researchers.": 1,
    " produce media for dissemination to the public free through the SIARC website.": 1,
    "These would be used for education, cultural tourism, etc.": 1,
    " What you're looking at in here is a 3d viewer that we developed that would allow the display and manipulation of cloud of points in real time": 1,
    " cutting sections through them and extracting dimensions.": 1,
    "This happens to be the cloud of points for Tikal.": 1,
    "In here you see a traditional 2D architectural engineering drawing that's used for preservation.": 1,
    " And of course, we tell the stories through fly-throughs.": 1,
    "In here, this is a fly-through, the cloud of points of Tikal.": 1,
    "In here, you see it rendered and photo-textured with photography that we take of the site.": 1,
    " And so this is not a video.": 1,
    "This is actual 3D points with 2 to 3 millimeter accuracy.": 1,
    " And of course the data can be used to develop 3D models that are very accurate and very detailed.": 1,
    "And here you're looking at a model": 1,
    " that's extracted from the Cloud Appoints for Stirling Castle.": 1,
    "It's used for studies, for visualization, as well as for education.": 1,
    "And finally, we produce mobile apps that include narrated virtual tools.": 1,
    " The more I got involved in the heritage field, the more it became clear to me that we're losing the sites and the stories faster than we can physically preserve them.": 1,
    " Of course, earthquakes and all the natural phenomena, floods, tornadoes, etc., take their toll.": 1,
    " However, what occurred to me was human-caused destruction, which was not only causing a significant portion of the destruction, but actually it was accelerating.": 1,
    "This includes arson,": 1,
    " urban sprawl, acid rain, not to mention terrorism and wars.": 1,
    "It was getting more and more apparent that we're fighting a losing battle.": 1,
    "We're losing our sights.": 1,
    " and the stories and basically we're losing a piece and a significant piece of our collective memory.": 1,
    " imagine us as a human race, not knowing where we came from.": 1,
    "Luckily, the last two or three decades, digital technologies have been developing": 1,
    " that have helped us to develop tools that we brought to bear in our digital preservation work.": 1,
    "This includes": 1,
    " For example, the 3D laser scanning systems, ever more powerful personal computers, 3D graphics, high definition digital photography, not to mention the internet.": 1,
    " Because of this accelerated pace of destruction,": 1,
    " it became clear to us that we needed to challenge ourselves and our partners to accelerate our work, and we created a project we call the SciArc 500 Challenge.": 1,
    " and that is to digitally preserve 500 World Heritage sites in five years.": 1,
    "We do have the technology that's scalable.": 1,
    " And our network of global partners has been expanding and can be expanded at a rapid rate.": 1,
    "So we're comfortable that the stats can be accomplished.": 1,
    " However, to me, the 500 is really just the first 500.": 1,
    "In order to sustain our work into the future, we use technology centers": 1,
    " where we partner with local universities and colleges to take the technology to them, whereby they then can help us with digital preservation of their heritage sites.": 1,
    " And at the same time, it gives them the technology to benefit from in the future.": 1,
    " Let me close with another short story.": 1,
    "Two years ago, we were approached by a partner of ours to digitally preserve an important heritage site, a UNESCO heritage site in Uganda.": 1,
    " the Royal Kasubi Tombs.": 1,
    "The work was done successfully in the field and the data was archived and publicly disseminated through the SIRC website.": 1,
    "Last March,": 1,
    " we received very sad news.": 1,
    "The royal tomb had been destroyed by suspected arson.": 1,
    " A few days later we receive a call, is the data available and can it be used for reconstruction?": 1,
    " Our answer, of course, was yes.": 1,
    " Let me leave you with a final thought.": 1,
    "Our heritage is much more than our collective memory.": 1,
    "It's our collective treasure.": 1,
    "We owe it to our children, our grandchildren.": 1,
    " and the generations we will never meet to keep it safe.": 1,
    " and to pass it along.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " Well,": 1,
    " I'm staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to you": 1,
    " the power of this technology.": 1,
    "And so while I've been speaking, you have been scanned.": 1,
    " The two wizards that I have that are behind the curtain will help me bring the results": 1,
    " on the screen.": 1,
    " This is all in 3D, and of course you can fly through the cloud of points.": 1,
    "You can look at it from on top, from the ceiling.": 1,
    "You can look from different vantage points.": 1,
    "But I'm going to ask Doug to zoom in on": 1,
    " an individual in the crowd just to show the amount of detail that we can create.": 1,
    " So you have been digitally preserved in about four minutes.": 1,
    " I'd like to thank the wizards here.": 1,
    "We were very lucky to have": 1,
    " Two of our partners participate in this, the Historic Scotland and the Glasgow School of Art.": 1,
    " I'd like to also thank personally the efforts of David Mitchell, who is the Director of Conservation at Historic Scotland.": 1,
    "David.": 1,
    " and Doug Pritchard, who is the head of visualization at the Glasgow School of Art.": 1,
    "Let's give him a hand.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
