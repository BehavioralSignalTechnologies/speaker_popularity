    " The End": 1,
    " I'm gonna finish this one.": 1,
    " Oh.": 1,
    " Do you have any questions?": 1,
    " I'm like.": 1,
    " Calm down and get back into my body now.": 1,
    "Usually when I play out, the first thing that happens is people scream out.": 1,
    " What's she doing?": 1,
    "You know, I'll play at these rock shows, you know, be on stage, standing completely still, you know, just... And they're like, what's she doing?": 1,
    "What's she doing?": 1,
    "You know, and then I'll just kind of be like, whoo!": 1,
    "You know, and then they're like...": 1,
    " I'm sure if you're trying to figure out, how does this thing work?": 1,
    "Well, what I'm doing is controlling them.": 1,
    " the pitch with my left hand.": 1,
    "So the closer I get to this antenna, the higher the note": 1,
    " And with this hand, I'm controlling the volume so the further away my right hand gets, the louder it gets.": 1,
    " So basically with both of your hands you're controlling pitch and volume and kind of trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes when really it's continuously going.": 1,
    " What?": 1,
    " Sometimes I startle myself, I'll forget that I have it on, and I'll lean over to pick up something, and then it goes like, oh, you know.": 1,
    " It's like a funny sound effect that follows you around if you don't turn the thing off.": 1,
    " Maybe we'll go into the next tune because I've totally lost words at this moment.": 1,
    " We're going to do a song by David Nash called Listen The Words Are Gone and maybe I'll have words come back into me afterwards.": 1,
    " Ah...": 1,
    " Um, so, uh...": 1,
    " I'm trying to think of some of the questions that are commonly asked.": 1,
    "There are so many.": 1,
    "I guess I could tell you a little of the history of the theorem.": 1,
    "It was invented around the 1920s.": 1,
    " the inventor Leon Thurman.": 1,
    "He also is a musician besides an inventor.": 1,
    "He kind of came up with the idea for": 1,
    " making the theremin, I think when he was working on some shortwave radios and there'd be that sound in the signal, it's like...": 1,
    " And he thought, oh, what if I could control that sound and turn it into an instrument?": 1,
    "Because there are pitches in it.": 1,
    "And so somehow...": 1,
    " Through developing that, he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now.": 1,
    " A lot of times, even kids nowadays, they'll make reference to them by going... Because in the 50s, it was used in the sci-fi horror movies, that sound that's like...": 1,
    " It's kind of a funny, goofy sound to do.": 1,
    "And sometimes if I have too much coffee, my vibrato gets out of hand.": 1,
    " You're really sensitive to your body and its functions when you're behind the scene.": 1,
    "You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control.": 1,
    "It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on, what Michael was doing, because you're fighting so hard.": 1,
    " to keep the balance with what you're playing with and stay in tune.": 1,
    "At the same time, you don't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time.": 1,
    "You want to be feeling the music.": 1,
    " And then also you're trying to stay very, very, very still because little movements with other parts of your body will affect the pitch or sometimes if you're holding a low note.": 1,
    " And breathing, you know, will make it.": 1,
    "If I pass out on the next song.": 1,
    "But it's definitely, I think of it almost like it's": 1,
    " It's kind of like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing or just aware of what you don't want it to be doing while you're playing.": 1,
    " have any sudden movements and you know if I go to a club and play a gig people are like here have some drinks on us and it's like well I'm about to go on soon I don't want to be like": 1,
    " It really does reflect the mood that you're in also.": 1,
    "It's similar to being a vocalist except instead of it coming out of your throat.": 1,
    " controlling it just in the air and you don't really have a point of reference.": 1,
    "You're always relying on your ears and": 1,
    " adjusting constantly, you just have to always adjust to what's happening and realize you'll have bummer notes come here and there and listen to it, adjust and then just move on or else you'll get too tied up and go crazy.": 1,
    " Maybe we'll play another tune now.": 1,
    "We're going to do Lush Life.": 1,
    "It's one of my favorite tunes to play.": 1,
    " I'll be back.": 1,
    " It's amazing.": 1,
    " Ah.": 1,
    " I need some...": 1
