    " until I can actually get this started.": 1,
    "This is a work in process based on some comments that were made at TED two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine.": 1,
    " you": 1,
    " I want to be alone": 1,
    " So 29 years ago, I had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration.": 1,
    "It was one of those things that stuck in my head.": 1,
    "It was a lot like the Stirling engine.": 1,
    "It was cool, but you didn't know what to do with it.": 1,
    " And it was invented in 1858 by this guy, Ferdinand Carr\u00e9, but he couldn't actually build anything with it because of the tools at the time.": 1,
    " This crazy Canadian named Powell Crosley commercialized this thing called the Icy Ball in 1928, and it was a really neat idea, and I'll get to why it didn't work, but here's how it works.": 1,
    "There's two spheres.": 1,
    " And they're separated in distance.": 1,
    "One has a working fluid, water, and ammonia, and the other is a condenser.": 1,
    "You heat up one side, the hot side, the ammonia evaporates, and it recondenses in the other side.": 1,
    "You let it cool to room temperature.": 1,
    " and then as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side, it creates a powerful cooling effect.": 1,
    " So it was a great idea.": 1,
    "Didn't work at all.": 1,
    "They blew up.": 1,
    "Because of using ammonia, you get hugely high pressures if you did it, if you heated them wrong.": 1,
    "They topped 400 PSI.": 1,
    "The ammonia was toxic.": 1,
    "It sprayed everywhere.": 1,
    "But it's kind of an interesting thought.": 1,
    " So the great thing about 2006, there's a lot of really great computational work you can do.": 1,
    "So we got the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford involved, a lot of computational fluid dynamics.": 1,
    "We proved": 1,
    " that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong.": 1,
    "We found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures.": 1,
    " brought in a team from the UK, there's a lot of great refrigeration people that are down in the UK, and built a test rig and proved that in fact we could make a low-pressure, non-toxic refrigerator.": 1,
    "So this is the way it works.": 1,
    "You put it on a cooking fire.": 1,
    " Most people have cooking fires in the world, whether it's camel dung or wood.": 1,
    "It heats up for about 30 minutes, cools for an hour.": 1,
    " Put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hours.": 1,
    "It looks like this.": 1,
    "This is the fifth prototype.": 1,
    "It's not quite done.": 1,
    " weighs about eight pounds, and this is the way it works.": 1,
    "You put it into a 15-liter vessel, about three gallons, and it'll cool it down to just above freezing, three degrees above freezing.": 1,
    " for 24 hours in a 30-degree C environment.": 1,
    "It's really cheap.": 1,
    "We think we can build these in high volumes for about $25, in low volumes for about $40.": 1,
    "And we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
