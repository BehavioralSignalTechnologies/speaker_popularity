    " The moment I make it, it's fun.": 1,
    "I keep playing with it.": 1,
    "Children don't do it because someone tells them to do it.": 1,
    "It's not like the boss at work told them to do it.": 1,
    "No one told them to do it.": 1,
    "They do it.": 1,
    " There must have been a moment when you felt the joy of the original art when you were young.": 1,
    "When I asked the students at school to write about the happiest moment,": 1,
    " Many students talk about the original artistic experience they had when they were young.": 1,
    "First, they learned how to play the piano with their friends.": 1,
    "Then, they learned how to play some ridiculous piece of opera with their friends.": 1,
    " I think there will be moments like that.": 1,
    "Until now, art is happy, because it is not work.": 1,
    " It's not happy.": 1,

    " Even if you become an elementary school student, if you continue to paint the walls of your house, you will be greatly criticized by your mother.": 1,
    " Even though it's not always like that, as we get older, when we act like artists, we start to think that someone is watching us.": 1,

    " There were a lot of female middle school students there, but in a word, it was a shame.": 1,
    "My explanation did not work at all, and I was scolded a lot.": 1,
    " If he was an ideal teacher, as I said earlier, he would have said, I don't have the talent for drawing, but I have the talent for speaking, and he would have encouraged me, but he is very rare.": 1,
    " Later, when I went to the modern art museum in Europe and became a college student, I felt wronged.": 1,

    " Yes, this is a work by Pablo Picasso.": 1,
    "He put a handle on a bicycle seat and said it was a bull's head.": 1,
    " For example, if you look at Duchamp, who said, this is a ready-made Semi.": 1,

    "This is what modern art has done.": 1,
    " Picasso even said, I draw what I think, not what I see.": 1,
    "You don't have to draw it in case.": 1,

    "It appears in a negative direction.": 1,
    "It usually appears in the sense of timing.": 1,
    "There's this song.": 1,
    "I wish I could appear on television.": 1,
    "Why do you like it?": 1,
    " In television, there are many people who do things that we want to do but we can't do.": 1,
    "Not only singing, dancing, acting, but the more you do it, the more compliments you get.": 1,
    " So, we start to be madly jealous of them.": 1,
    "So, we start to curse them by being a dictator with a remote control.": 1,
    " We talk about whether it is acting or acting, whether it is singing, or whether it is a singer who can't sing.": 1,
    "It is not because we are evil, but because we have these young artists in our hearts.": 1,
    " I think it's a phenomenon that can only be seen on television.": 1,
    "Then what will happen?": 1,
    "Yes, that's right.": 1,
    "We need to start our own art right now.": 1,
    "We need to turn off television and internet connection.": 1,

    "School, army, even mental hospital.": 1,
    "I've seen it in the army.": 1,
    " So I saw people who enjoyed acting.": 1,
    "I also have this experience.": 1,
    "When I teach writing, I give assignments to students.": 1,
    "Students gather like this.": 1,
    " But there are many students who are not majoring in writing.": 1,
    "There are many art students and music students.": 1,
    "These students think that they can't write.": 1,
    "So I give them a blank paper and a topic.": 1,
    " For example, the topic is simple.": 1,
    "Write about the most unfortunate experience you had when you were young.": 1,
    "Instead, you have to write like crazy.": 1,
    "Like crazy.": 1,
    "When I go to work, my colleagues tell me to write quickly.": 1,
    "Like crazy, for two hours, two hours, one hour, or one hour.": 1,
    " The reason why I teach writing like crazy is because when you write slowly and have a lot of thoughts, the devil of the artist appears in our mind.": 1,
    " There are hundreds of reasons why you can't write.": 1,
    "While talking about hundreds of reasons why you can't write, others will laugh at you.": 1,

    "Look at the letters.": 1,
    "You have to listen to various things.": 1,
    " You have to run fast so that the devil can't catch up.": 1,
    "The really good writings I've seen in Hanhaejeong aren't from assignments that give enough time, but from the writings that students have written in front of me for 40 minutes or an hour.": 1,
    " So I found it.": 1,
    "Those students fall into some kind of trap.": 1,
    "In the next 30 to 40 minutes, they don't even know what they're writing.": 1,
    " But at that moment, the devil that interferes with us doesn't appear.": 1,
    "So I can say this.": 1,
    "There are hundreds of reasons why you can't become an artist.": 1,
    " The only reason you have to be an artist is to make someone an artist.": 1,
    "The reason you can't be an artist is not important.": 1,
    "That's how most artists became artists.": 1,
    " Now, when we try to seduce the devil in our hearts and try to start our own art, the enemies start to appear from outside.": 1,
    "Most of the time, they have the face of their parents.": 1,

    "They are people who have changed and come down to earth to become your artists.": 1,
    "I have a magic question for them.": 1,
    " What are you going to do with that?": 1,
    "It's a magical question.": 1,
    "What are you going to do with that?": 1,
    " But art is not about doing something.": 1,
    "Art is the ultimate ultimate purpose.": 1,
    "It is to save our souls and make us happy.": 1,
    "So that we can live happily without the help of alcohol and drugs.": 1,
    " self-expression.": 1,

    "The taxi is in the back seat.": 1,
    " There was something related to the play.": 1,
    "I asked him what it was, and he said it was his profile.": 1,
    "I asked him what he was, and he said he was an actor.": 1,
    "He was a taxi driver, but he acted in a play.": 1,
    "I asked him what role he played in the play, and he said he was the real king.": 1,
    " Oh, King Lear.": 1,
    "Who can I say who I am?": 1,
    "King Lear's wonderful lines.": 1,
    "That's the kind of world I dream of.": 1,

    "I asked him that in 1990.": 1,
    "Then he said,": 1,
    " Just do it.": 1,
    " Wow, that was very touching.": 1,
    "After saying these three words, you went straight to the entrance.": 1,
    "That's right.": 1,
    "What do we need right now?": 1,
    "Let's become artists.": 1,
