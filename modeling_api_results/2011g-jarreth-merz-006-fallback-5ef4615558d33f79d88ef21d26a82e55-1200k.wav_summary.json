    " I was born in Switzerland and raised in Ghana, West Africa.": 1,
    " Ghana felt safe to me as a child.": 1,
    "I was free, I was happy.": 1,
    " The early 70s marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in Ghana.": 1,
    "But then by the end of the decade, the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement.": 1,
    " In 1979 I witnessed my first military coup.": 1,
    " we the children had gathered at a friend's house and it was a dimly lit shack there was a beaten up black and white television flickering in the background and former head of state in general was being blindfolded": 1,
    " and tied to the pole, the firing squad aimed, fired, the general was dead.": 1,
    "Now this was being broadcast live and shortly after we left the country and we returned to Switzerland.": 1,
    " Now, Europe came as a shock to me and I think I started feeling the need to shed my skin in order to fit in.": 1,
    "I wanted to blend in like a chameleon.": 1,
    "I think it was the tactics of survival.": 1,
    "And it worked.": 1,
    " or so I believed.": 1,
    "So here I was in 2008, wondering where I was in my life.": 1,
    " And I felt that I was being typecast as an actor.": 1,
    "I was always playing the exotic African, I was playing the violent African, the African terrorist.": 1,
    " And I was thinking, how many terrorists could I possibly play before turning into one myself?": 1,
    "And I had become ashamed of the other, the African in me.": 1,
    " And fortunately I decided in 2008 to return to Ghana after 28 years of absence.": 1,
    "I wanted to document and film the 2008 presidential elections.": 1,
    " and there I started by searching for the footprints in my childhood and before I even knew it I was suddenly on a stage": 1,
    " surrounded by thousands of cheering people during a political rally.": 1,
    "And I realized that when I left the country, free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream.": 1,
    " And now that I returned, that dream had become reality, though a fragile reality.": 1,
    "And I was thinking, was Ghana searching for its identity like I was looking for my identity?": 1,
    "Was what was happening in Ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me?": 1,
    " And": 1,
    " It was as if, through the standards of my Western life, I hadn't lived up to my full potential.": 1,
    "I mean, nor had Ghana.": 1,
    " even though we have been trying very hard.": 1,
    "Now in 1957, Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to gain its independence.": 1,
    " In the late 50s, Ghana and Singapore had the same GDP.": 1,
    "I mean, today, Singapore is a first world country and Ghana is not.": 1,
    " But maybe it was time to prove to myself, yes, it's important to understand the past, it is important to look at it in a different light, but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture.": 1,
    " and build on those foundations in the present.": 1,
    "So here I was December 7th, 2008.": 1,
    " The polling stations open to the voters at 7am, but voters, eager to take their own political fate into their hands,": 1,
    " were starting to line up at 4 a.m.": 1,
    "in the morning.": 1,
    "And they had traveled from near, they had traveled from far because they wanted to make their voices heard.": 1,
    " And I asked one of the voters, I said, whom are you going to vote for?": 1,
    "And he said, I'm sorry, I can't tell you.": 1,
    "He said that his vote was in his heart.": 1,
    "And I understood this was their election.": 1,
    "And they weren't going to let anyone take it away from them.": 1,
    " Now, the first round of the voting didn't bring forth a clear winner, so nobody had achieved the absolute majority.": 1,
    "So voting went into a second round three weeks later.": 1,
    "The candidates were back on the road, they were campaigning.": 1,
    " The rhetoric of the candidates, of course, changed.": 1,
    "The heat was on.": 1,
    " The cliche came to haunt us.": 1,
    " There was claims of intimidation at the polling stations, of ballot boxes being stolen.": 1,
    " Inflated results started coming in.": 1,
    " And the mob was starting to get out of control.": 1,
    "We witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets.": 1,
    "People were being beaten brutally.": 1,
    "The army started firing their guns.": 1,
    "People were scrambling.": 1,
    "It was complete chaos.": 1,
    " And my heart sank because I thought, here we are again.": 1,
    "Here is another proof that the African is not capable of governing himself.": 1,
    "And not only that, I am documenting it, documenting my own cultural shortcomings.": 1,
    " So when the echo of the gunshots had lingered,": 1,
    " It was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob and I didn't believe what I was hearing.": 1,
    "They were chanting, we want peace.": 1,
    "We want peace.": 1,
    " And I realized it had to come from the people.": 1,
    "After all, they decide.": 1,
    " And they did.": 1,
    "So the sounds that were before distorted and loud were suddenly a melody.": 1,
    "The sounds of the voices were harmonious.": 1,
    " So it could happen.": 1,
    " a democracy could be upheld peacefully.": 1,
    "It could be by the will of the masses who are now urgently pressing with all their hearts and all their will for peace.": 1,
    " Now here's an interesting comparison.": 1,
    "We in the West, we preach the values, the golden light of democracy, that we are the shining example of how it's done.": 1,
    " But when it comes down to it, Ghana found itself in the same place in which the US election stalled in the 2000 presidential elections, Bush versus Gore.": 1,
    " But instead of the unwillingness of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide, Ghana honored democracy and its people.": 1,
    " It didn't leave it up to the Supreme Court to decide.": 1,
    "The people did.": 1,
    " Now,": 1,
    " The second round of voting did not bring forth a clear winner either.": 1,
    "I mean it was so incredibly close.": 1,
    "The Electoral Commissioner declared with the consent of the parties to run an unprecedented second rerun.": 1,
    " So the people went back to the polls to determine their own president, not the legal system.": 1,
    " And guess what?": 1,
    "It worked.": 1,
    " the defeated candidate gave up power and made way for Ghana to move into a new democratic cycle.": 1,
    "I mean at the absolute time, for the absolute need of democracy, they did not abuse their power.": 1,
    " The belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep, proving that the African is capable of governing himself.": 1,
    "Now, the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africa is not over.": 1,
    " But I have proof that the other side of democracy exists and that we must not take it for granted.": 1,
    " Now, I have learned that my place is not just in the West or in Africa, and I'm still searching for my identity.": 1,
    " But I saw Ghana create democracy better.": 1,
    "Ghana taught me to look at people differently and to look at myself differently.": 1,
    " And yes, we Africans can.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
