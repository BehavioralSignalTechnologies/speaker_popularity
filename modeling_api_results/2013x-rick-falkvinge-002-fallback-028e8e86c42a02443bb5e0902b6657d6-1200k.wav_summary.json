    " Do you want to be that person?": 2,
    " thank you all this is going to be a motivational speech": 1,
    " Imagine my motivation standing between this strong, healthy crowd and lunch.": 1,
    " So.": 1,
    " I'm Falkvinge on Twitter.": 1,
    "Feel free to quote me if I say something memorable, stupid, funny, whatever.": 1,
    "I love seeing my name on Twitter.": 1,
    "So, hi.": 1,
    "I'm Rick.": 1,
    "I'm a politician.": 1,
    "I'm sorry.": 1,
    " How many in here have heard of the Swedish Pirate Party before?": 1,
    "Let's see a show of hands.": 1,
    " Okay, that's practically everybody.": 1,
    "Probably due to that we're Sweden's neighbor.": 1,
    "I frequently ask how many have heard of any other political party and there's always just scattered hands in the audience compared to...": 1,
    " this first question, which is one-half to two-thirds.": 1,
    "This is actually the first time ever that does not match.": 1,
    "It was practically everybody.": 1,
    "So...": 1,
    " For those who haven't heard of us, of the Pirate Party, we love the net.": 1,
    " We love copying and sharing, and we love civil liberties.": 1,
    " For that, some people call us pirates.": 1,
    " probably an attempt to make us bow our head and feel shame.": 1,
    "That didn't work very well.": 1,
    "We decided to stand tall about it instead and so in 2006 I founded a new political party.": 1,
    "I led it for its first five years and": 1,
    " In the European elections, last European elections, we became the largest party in the most coveted youth demographic, sub-30.": 1,
    "And what's interesting is that we did that on less than 1%.": 1,
    " of the competition's budget.": 1,
    " We had a campaign budget total of 50,000 euros.": 1,
    "They had 6 million between them.": 1,
    "And we beat them.": 1,
    " That gave us a cost efficiency advantage of over two orders of magnitude.": 1,
    " And I'm going to share the secret recipe of how we did that.": 1,
    " We developed swarm methodologies.": 1,
    " and they can be applied to any business or social cause.": 1,
    " Well, almost any.": 1,
    "There's a small asterisk by the any.": 1,
    "And I'll get to that in just a minute.": 1,
    "But applying these, and we've done this dozens of times, we know that this works.": 1,
    " We've put two people in the European Parliament.": 1,
    "We have 45 people in various German state parliaments.": 1,
    "We're in the Icelandic Parliament, the Czech Senate, many, many, many more local councils, and as said, we've spread to 70 countries.": 1,
    " And that's not bad for a political movement that hasn't even been around for a decade.": 1,
    " so today we're going to talk a bit about": 1,
    " how people are motivated to be part of change, to be part of something bigger than themselves.": 1,
    " and how you can channel this into an organization that harnesses this great power of wanting to make the world a better place.": 1,
    " and in the end, come out a little on the better.": 1,
    " When I speak to business people, I frequently make them very upset when I contradict them and say that, no, your employees is not your most valuable asset.": 1,
    " Your most valuable asset is the thousands of people who want to work for you for free, and you don't let them.": 1,
    " They get very upset about that.": 1,
    " A swarm is a congregation of tens of thousands of volunteers that have chosen, of their own will, to converge on a common goal.": 1,
    "There is this Futurama quote.": 1,
    " When push comes to shove, you gotta do what you love.": 1,
    " even if it's not a good idea.": 1,
    " I mean, seriously, what kind of idiot thinks they can change the world by starting a political party?": 1,
    " This kind of idea apparently.": 1,
    "But it works.": 1,
    " What you need to do is to put a stake in the ground.": 1,
    "You need to announce your goal.": 1,
    "Just say, I want to accomplish this.": 1,
    "I'm going to do this.": 1,
    " And it doesn't need to be very costly.": 1,
    "My announcement was just two lines in a chat channel.": 1,
    " Hey, look, the Pirate Party has its website up now after New Year's and the address.": 1,
    "That was all the advertising I ever did.": 1,
    "The next time, I had several hundred activists wanting to work with us.": 1,
    " When you provide such a focus point, a swarm intelligence emerges when people can rally to a flag.": 1,
    "And that's what gives you this two orders of magnitude of cost efficiency.": 1,
    " It's a huge advantage.": 1,
    "You're running circles around all the legacy organizations.": 1,
    " And there are four goals that need to be fulfilled in your goal in order for this to work.": 1,
    " These four criteria are that your goal must be tangible, credible, inclusive and epic.": 1,
    " Let's take a look at them.": 1,
    "It needs to be tangible.": 1,
    "A lot of people say, you know, we should make the world a better place.": 1,
    "Or like, yeah, we should all like feel good, man.": 1,
    " Not going to work.": 1,
    " You need a binary.": 1,
    "Are we there yet or are we not there yet?": 1,
    "It needs to be credible.": 1,
    "Somebody seeing the project plan that you're posting needs to see that, yes, this project plan will take us from where we are to where we want to be.": 1,
    " You need to break it down into sub-goals that each by themselves are seen as doable, and when you add the sub-goals together,": 1,
    " we've gone to where we want.": 1,
    "And this is where it gets exciting in terms of working swarm-wise.": 1,
    "It needs to be inclusive.": 1,
    "Anybody who sees this project plan needs to immediately see, I want to do this.": 1,
    " And there's my spot.": 1,
    " And they will be able to jump right into the project and start working on it without asking anybody's permission.": 1,
    "And that is exactly what will happen.": 1,
    " And last but not least, it needs to be epic.": 1,
    " It needs to energize people.": 1,
    "It needs to electrify people.": 1,
    "Shoot for the moon.": 1,
    " On second thought, don't shoot for the moon.": 1,
    "We've already been there.": 1,
    "Shoot for Mars.": 1,
    " In contrast, you will never be able to get a volunteer swarm forming around making the most correct tax audit ever.": 1,
    " doesn't electrify people.": 1,
    "Go to Mars!": 1,
    " A lot of people kind of bark at the obstacles, going to climb a huge mountain.": 1,
    "So how do you motivate people to do that?": 1,
    "Well, it turns out that obstacles are not the problem.": 1,
    " Not knowing the obstacles are the problem.": 1,
    "If you know how the mountain is, you know exactly what it takes to scale it.": 1,
    "We know exactly how far away Mars is and what it takes to get there.": 1,
    "If you can plan it like a project,": 1,
    " You can plan what resources you need and you can execute it exactly like a project.": 1,
    "Let's see, we're going to Mars.": 1,
    "We need two dozen volunteer rocket scientists, one dozen volunteer metallurgists,": 1,
    " some crazy dude who will mix rocket fuel in his backyard, and so on.": 1,
    " When you can list the resources, you know what you need to get there.": 1,
    "When you know what you need to get there, you can go there.": 1,
    " And the next thing is to encourage this development of a swarm intelligence, which is where the cost efficiency comes in.": 1,
    "There is a TED talk": 1,
    " on motivation that debunks that we work for money.": 1,
    " And it presents science on how we're really motivated by three things in terms of larger creative tasks when we work for something bigger than ourselves.": 1,
    "We work for autonomy, mastery, and purpose.": 1,
    " We've covered purpose already, as in working for something bigger, tangible, credible, inclusive, and epic.": 1,
    " So, where that talk ends, that motivation talk ends, and what it doesn't answer is, how do you build an organization that harnesses this motivational power?": 1,
    " And this is where working swarm-wise comes in.": 1,
    "This is where swarm intelligence comes in.": 1,
    "Turns out that there are three factors that you optimize for.": 1,
    "And each of these are in complete opposite to what you learn at a business school.": 1,
    " But it works.": 1,
    "We know it works.": 1,
    "We have people in many, many parliaments to prove it.": 1,
    "Those three factors are speed, trust and scalability.": 1,
    " We optimize for speed by cutting bottlenecks out of the loop, cutting them out of the decision loop.": 1,
    "That means cutting yourself out of the decision loop.": 1,
    " which can be hard but you gotta communicate your vision so passionately so strongly that everybody knows what the goal is": 1,
    " and can find something, some step, that takes the movement just a little closer to that goal.": 1,
    "And when tens of thousands of people do that on a weekly basis,": 1,
    " you become an unstoppable force.": 1,
    " We had a three-person rule in our organization saying that if three self-identified volunteers in the movement were in agreement that something was good for the movement,": 1,
    " that they had the green light from the highest office to go ahead and act in the name of the organization, including spending resources.": 1,
    " When you talk about this kind of empowerment to traditional business people, they think you belong in a zoo.": 1,
    " But you know what?": 1,
    "I led this organization for five years.": 1,
    "There were 50,000 registered members and many, many more anonymous activists.": 1,
    "It was not abused once.": 1,
    " Everybody had the key to the treasure chest.": 1,
    "It was not abused one single time Turns out when you give people the keys to the castle and say look them in the eye I say and say I trust you": 1,
    " they step up to the plate.": 1,
    " And that's a beautiful thing to see happen.": 1,
    " Obviously not everything went according to plan.": 1,
    "That's a different thing.": 1,
    "We made mistakes.": 1,
    "We should expect mistakes.": 1,
    "If you're pioneering something, that means you must, by definition, venture into the unknown.": 1,
    " When you're trying the unknown, some things won't go as planned.": 1,
    "That's part of the definition of venturing into the unknown.": 1,
    "To find the great, you must allow mistakes to happen.": 1,
    " So you must communicate that we expect some things to go wrong to create a risk positive environment.": 1,
    " Therefore, we optimize for iteration speed, meaning that we try, we fail, we try again, we fail faster, we fail better, we try again, we fail better again.": 1,
    " Maybe after we've tried 15 times, we've mastered some specific subject, so you want to minimize the time it takes to try those 15 times.": 1,
    " You optimize your trust, you encourage diversity.": 1,
    "You need to communicate your vision so strongly so that everybody can translate it into their own context.": 1,
    " because language is an incredibly strong inclusionary and exclusionary marker, social marker.": 1,
    " This one brand fits all message.": 1,
    "Forget it.": 1,
    "That's what they teach at business school.": 1,
    "It doesn't work.": 1,
    "Or at least it doesn't give you the cost efficiency advantage of working swarm-wise.": 1,
    " This leads to a lot of different approaches tried in parallel in different social groups who try out different methods of working toward the goal.": 1,
    "Some of them will work.": 1,
    " But in order to find the great ones, you need this diversity.": 1,
    "And you need to communicate that we need the diversity.": 1,
    "If somebody on this side does not understand what those guys are doing,": 1,
    " That's okay, because we all trust each other to work for the better of the movement.": 1,
    "And it's okay that I don't understand their social context.": 1,
    "I'm not expected to.": 1,
    "I understand my social context.": 1,
    "I contribute with something I know.": 1,
    " Make people aware of this diversity.": 1,
    "Finally, scalability.": 1,
    "Get feet on the ground.": 1,
    "Again, in business school they teach you to use a lean organization.": 1,
    "Forget that.": 1,
    " Just scale up the organization from the get-go.": 1,
    "Start with 10,000 empty boxes in an org chart covering down to every minor city.": 1,
    " When you have lots and lots of small responsibilities and such a scaffolding that supports the swarm, supports the activists, you'll find that these boxes in the org charts are getting filled in": 1,
    " quite rapidly and they start to be filled in beyond your horizon with people you've never heard of.": 1,
    " And so this swarm keeps growing, keeps growing to tens of thousands of people, each taking on something, something small with very, very decentralized mandate to act on the organization.": 1,
    " And this is when a swarm intelligence emerges.": 1,
    "This is when you have this beehive logic where everybody knows what's to be done.": 1,
    "Everybody is taking their own small steps towards it.": 1,
    " So the swarm starts to act as a coherent organism, and it's amazing to watch.": 1,
    "This is when you're rewarded by the cost-efficiency advantage over your competitors.": 1,
    " by two orders of magnitude.": 1,
    "Two orders of magnitude.": 1,
    "This is not just a silver bullet.": 1,
    " So, we've been talking a lot about the big picture today.": 1,
    "You can use these swarm methods for a lot of stuff.": 1,
    "Do you want to change the world?": 1,
    " Do you want to bring clean water to a billion people, teach three billion people to read?": 1,
    "Maybe you're into social change, you want to introduce an unconditional basic income.": 1,
    "Or maybe you want to take humanity to Mars.": 1,
    "You can do this using these methods.": 1,
    " You can't do this.": 1,
    "It's about leadership.": 1,
    "It's about deciding what you want to do and telling it to the world.": 1,
    "Because no matter whether you think you can or cannot change the world,": 1,
    " no matter whether you think you can or cannot change the world.": 1,
    " You are probably right.": 1,
    " So one question I want everybody here to ask themselves today is the observation that change doesn't just happen.": 1,
    "Somebody makes it happen.": 1,
    " And then one last thing.": 1,
    " There's one component more that's required to work swarm-wise that I haven't mentioned yet.": 1,
    "And that is fun.": 1,
    " This goes beyond just enjoying your job.": 1,
    "This goes beyond having a pinball machine in the office.": 1,
    " because this is actually required to succeed.": 1,
    " in a swarm-wise scenario, this is required to succeed to get that cost-efficiency advantage of two orders of magnitude for the reason you need to attract volunteers.": 1,
    " And people in this aspect are rather predictable.": 1,
    " people will go to other people who are having fun.": 1,
    " In contrast, they will walk an extra mile to avoid people who are not having fun.": 1,
    " So having fun is more than just having a pinball machine in the office.": 1,
    "It's an absolute and unavoidable requirement.": 1,
    " for organisational and operational success when you're working swarm-wise.": 1,
    "So, in summary,": 1,
    " A recipe for a swarm organization using these motivational methods to a huge competitive advantage.": 1,
    " Your goal needs to be tangible, credible, inclusive, and epic.": 1,
    " Your organization needs to be optimized for speed, trust and scalability.": 1,
    " You need to enjoy yourselves.": 1,
    " And that will reward you with two orders of magnitude of cost efficiency advantage.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
