    " Guatemala is recovering from a 36-year-old conflict, a conflict that was fought during the Cold War.": 1,
    "It was really just a small leftist insurgency and a devastating response by the state.": 1,
    " What we have as a result is 200,000 civilian victims, 160,000 of those killed in the communities, small children, men, women, the elderly even.": 1,
    " And then we have about 40,000 others, the missing, the ones we're still looking for today.": 1,
    "We call them the desaparecidos.": 1,
    " Now, 83 percent of the victims are Mayan victims, victims that are the descendants of the original inhabitants of Central America, and only about 17 percent are of European descent.": 1,
    " The most important thing here is that the very people who are supposed to defend us, the police, the military, are the ones that committed most of the crimes.": 1,
    " Now the families, they want information.": 1,
    "They want to know what happened.": 1,
    "They want the bodies of their loved ones.": 1,
    "But most of all, what they want is they want you, they want everyone to know that their loved ones did nothing wrong.": 1,
    " Now my case was that my father received death threats.": 1,
    " in 1980, and we left.": 1,
    "We left Guatemala.": 1,
    "We came here.": 1,
    "So I grew up in New York.": 1,
    "I grew up in Brooklyn, as a matter of fact, and I went to New York Tech High School, and I graduated from Brooklyn College.": 1,
    " The only thing was that I really didn't know what was happening in Guatemala.": 1,
    "I didn't care for it.": 1,
    "It was too painful.": 1,
    "But it wasn't until 1995 that I decided to do something about it.": 1,
    "So I went back.": 1,
    "I went back to Guatemala.": 1,
    " to look for the bodies, to understand what happened, and to look for part of myself as well.": 1,
    " The way we work is that we give people information.": 1,
    "We talk to the family members and we let them choose.": 1,
    "We let them decide to tell us the stories, to tell us what they saw, to tell us about their loved ones.": 1,
    " And even more important, we let them choose to give them a piece of themselves, a piece, an essence of who they are.": 1,
    "And that DNA is what we're going to compare to the DNA that comes from the skeletons.": 1,
    " While we're doing that though, we're looking for the bodies.": 1,
    "And these are skeletons by now.": 1,
    "Most of these crimes happened 32 years ago.": 1,
    " When we find the grave, we take out the dirt and eventually clean the body, document it, and exhume it.": 1,
    "We literally bring the skeleton out of the ground.": 1,
    " Once we have those bodies, though, we take them back to the city, to our lab, and we'll begin a process of trying to understand mainly two things.": 1,
    "One is how people died.": 1,
    "So here you see a gunshot wound to the back of the head, or machete wounds, for example.": 1,
    " The other thing we want to understand, though, is who they are, whether it's a baby.": 1,
    " or an adult, whether it's a woman or a man.": 1,
    "But when we're done with that analysis, what we'll do is we'll take a small fragment bone and we'll extract DNA from it.": 1,
    " We'll take that DNA and then we'll compare it with the DNA of the families, of course.": 1,
    " The best way to explain this to you is by showing you two cases.": 1,
    "The first is the case of the military diary.": 1,
    "Now this is a document that was smuggled out of somewhere in 1999.": 1,
    " And what you see there is the state following individuals, people that, like you, wanted to change their country.": 1,
    " And they jot everything down.": 1,
    "And one of the things that they wrote down is when they executed them.": 1,
    "So inside that yellow rectangle, you'll see a code.": 1,
    "It's a secret code, 300.": 1,
    " and then you see a date.": 1,
    "The 300 means executed and the date means when they were executed.": 1,
    "Now that's going to come into play in a second.": 1,
    " What we did is we conducted an exhumation in 2003 where we exhumed 220 bodies from 53 graves in a military base.": 1,
    " Grave 9, though, matched the family of Sergio Salmon-Linares.": 1,
    "Now, Sergio was a professor at the university.": 1,
    "He graduated from Iowa State University and went back to Guatemala to change his country.": 1,
    " And he was captured on February 23, 1984.": 1,
    "And if you can see there, he was executed on March 29, 1984.": 1,
    " which was incredible.": 1,
    "We had the body, we had the family's information and the DNA, and now we have documented, told us exactly what happened.": 1,
    " But most important is about two weeks later, we got another hit, another match from the same grave to Amancio Viatoro.": 1,
    " The DNA of that body also matched the DNA of that family.": 1,
    "And then we noticed that he was also in the diary.": 1,
    "But it was amazing to see that he was also executed on March 29th, 1984.": 1,
    "So that led us to think, hmm.": 1,
    " How many bodies were in the grave?": 1,
    "Six.": 1,
    "So we said, how many people were executed on March 29th, 1984?": 1,
    " That's right, six as well.": 1,
    "So we have Juan de Dios, Hugo, Moises and Solo.": 1,
    " All of them executed on the same date, all captured at different locations and different moments, all put in that grave.": 1,
    "The only thing we needed now was the DNA of those four families.": 1,
    "So we went and we looked for them.": 1,
    " And we found them and we identified all six bodies and gave them back to the families.": 1,
    "The other case I want to tell you about.": 1,
    " is that of a military base called Creon Paz.": 1,
    " Regional Command Center for Peacekeeping Operations, and this is where the Guatemalan military trains peacekeepers from other countries.": 1,
    " the ones that serve with the UN and go to countries like Haiti and the Congo?": 1,
    "Well, we had testimony that said that within this military base there was bodies, there was graves.": 1,
    " So we went in there with a search warrant, and about two hours after we went in, we found the first of 84 graves.": 1,
    " a total of 533 bodies.": 1,
    "Now if you think about that, peacekeepers being trained on top of bodies.": 1,
    "It's very ironic.": 1,
    " But the bodies, face down most of them, hands tied behind their backs, blindfolded, all types of trauma.": 1,
    "These are people that were defenseless, that were being executed.": 1,
    "People that 533 families are looking for.": 1,
    " And so we're going to focus on grade 15.": 1,
    "Grade 15, when we noticed, was a grade full of women and children, 63 of them.": 1,
    "And that immediately made us think.": 1,
    " My goodness, where's a case like this?": 1,
    "When I got to Guatemala in 1995, I heard of a case of a massacre that happened on May 14th.": 1,
    " 1982, where the Army came in, killed the men, and took the women and children in helicopters to an unknown location.": 1,
    " Well, guess what?": 1,
    "The clothing from this grave matched the clothing from the region where these people were taken from, where these women and children were taken from.": 1,
    " So we conducted some DNA analysis and guess what?": 1,
    "We identified Martina Rojas and Manuel Chen.": 1,
    "Both of them disappeared in that case.": 1,
    "So now we could prove it.": 1,
    "We have physical evidence that proves that this happened and that those people were taken to this base.": 1,
    " Now, Manuel Chen was three years old.": 1,
    "His mother went to the river to wash clothes and she left him with a neighbor.": 1,
    " That's when the army came and that's when he was taken away in a helicopter, never seen again, till we found him in grade 15.": 1,
    " So now with science, with archaeology, with anthropology, with genetics, what we're doing is we're giving a voice to the voiceless.": 1,
    " But we're doing more than that.": 1,
    "We're actually providing evidence for trials, like the genocide trial that happened last year in Guatemala, where General Rios Montt was found guilty of genocide and sentenced to 80 years.": 1,
    " So I come here to tell you today that this is happening everywhere.": 1,
    "It's happening in Mexico right in front of us today, and we can't let it go on anymore.": 1,
    "We have to now": 1,
    " come together and decide that we are not going to have any more missing.": 1,
    "So no more missing, guys, okay?": 1,
    "No more missing.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
