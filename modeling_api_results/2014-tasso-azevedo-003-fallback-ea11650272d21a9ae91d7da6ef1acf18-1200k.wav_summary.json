    " When the Portuguese arrived in Latin America about 500 years ago, they obviously found this amazing tropical forest.": 1,
    " And among all this biodiversity that they have never seen before, they found one species that called the attention very quickly.": 1,
    " The species, when you cut the bark, you'll find a very dark red resin that was very good to paint and dye fabric to make clothes.": 1,
    " The indigenous people call this species Pau-Brasil and that's the reason why this land became land of Brazil and later on Brazil.": 1,
    "That's the only country in the world that has a name of a tree.": 1,
    " So you can imagine that it's very cool to be a forester in Brazil, among other reasons.": 1,
    " Forest products are all around us.": 1,
    "Apart from all those products, forest is very important for climate regulation.": 1,
    " In Brazil, almost 70% of the evaporation that makes rain actually come from the forest.": 1,
    "Just the Amazon bonds to the atmosphere.": 1,
    " 20 billion tons of water every day.": 1,
    "This is more than what the Amazon rivers": 1,
    " which is the largest river in the world, puts in the sea per day, which is 17 billion tons.": 1,
    "If we have to boil water to get the same effect in evapotranspiration, we would need six months": 1,
    " of the entire power generation capacity of the world.": 1,
    " So it's a hell of a service for all of us.": 1,
    " We have in the world about four billion hectares of forest.": 1,
    "This is more or less China, US, Canada, and Brazil all together in terms of size, to have an idea.": 1,
    " Three quarters of that are in the temperate zone.": 1,
    " And just one quarter is on the tropics.": 1,
    "But this one quarter, one billion hectares, holds most of the biodiversity, and very important, 50% of the living biomass, the carbon.": 1,
    " Now, we used to have like 6 billion actors of forest, 50% more than what we have 2,000 years ago.": 1,
    "We actually lose 2 billion actors in the last 2,000 years.": 1,
    " But in the last 100 years, we lose half of that.": 1,
    "That was when we shift from deforestation of temperate forests to deforestation of tropical forests.": 1,
    " So think of this.": 1,
    "In 100 years, we lose the same amount of forests in the tropics that we lose in 2,000 years in temperate forests.": 1,
    "That's the speed of the destruction that we are having.": 1,
    " Now, Brazil is an important piece of this puzzle.": 1,
    "We have the second largest forest in the world just after Russia.": 1,
    "It makes 12% of all the world's forests are in Brazil.": 1,
    " Most of that in the Amazon.": 1,
    "It's the large piece of forest we have.": 1,
    "It's a very big, large area.": 1,
    "I can see that you could feed many of the European countries there.": 1,
    " We still have 80% of the forest cover.": 1,
    "That's the good news.": 1,
    "But we lost 15% in just 30 years.": 1,
    " So if we go on this speed, very soon we will lose this powerful pump that we have in the Amazon that regulates our climate.": 1,
    "Deforestation was growing fast and accelerating in the end of the 90s and beginning of 2000.": 1,
    " 27,000 square kilometers in one year.": 1,
    "This is 2.7 million hectares.": 1,
    "It's almost like half of Costa Rica every year.": 1,
    " So at this moment, this 2003, 2004,": 1,
    " I've come to work in the government and together with another team mates on the National Forest Department, we were assigned a task to join a team": 1,
    " and find out the cause of deforestation and make a plan to combat that at national level involving the local governments, the civil society, the business, local communities, on an effort that could tackle those costs.": 1,
    " So we come up with this plan with 144 actions in different areas.": 1,
    "Now I will go to all of them one by one.": 1,
    "No.": 1,
    "Just give us some examples of what we have been done in the next years.": 1,
    " So the first thing, we set up a system with the National Spatial Agency that could actually see where deforestation has happened almost in real time.": 1,
    " So we know in Brazil we have this system where every month or every two months we got information where deforestation is happening.": 1,
    "So we can actually act when it's happening.": 1,
    " And all the information is full transparent so others can replicate that in independent systems.": 1,
    "This allows us, between other things, to apprehend 1.4 million cubic meters of logs that were illegally taken.": 1,
    " Part of that we saw and sell and all the revenue become a fund that now funds conservation projects of local communities.": 1,
    " as an endowment fund.": 1,
    "This also allows us to make big operations to seize corruption and illegal activities that end up on having 700 people in prison, including a lot of public servants.": 1,
    " Then we make the connection that areas that have been working on illegal deforestation should not receive any type of credit or finance.": 1,
    "So we cut this through the bank system.": 1,
    " And then link this to the end users, so supermarkets, the slaughterhouses and so on, that buy products from illegal clear-cut areas, they also can be liable for the deforestation.": 1,
    "So making all these connections to help to push the problem down.": 1,
    " And also, we work a lot on land tenure issues.": 1,
    "It's very important for conflicts.": 1,
    "50 million actors of protected areas were created, which is an area the size of probably something like the size of Spain.": 1,
    " And from those, 8 million were indigenous lands.": 1,
    "Now, we start to see results.": 1,
    " So in the last 10 years, deforestation has come down in Brazil 75%.": 1,
    " So if we compare with the average deforestation that we have on the last decade, we saved 8.7 million hectares, which is the size of Austria.": 1,
    " But more important, it avoids the emission of 3 billion tons of CO2 in the atmosphere.": 1,
    "This is by far the largest contribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions until today as a positive action.": 1,
    " One may think that when you do this type of actions to decrease, to push down deforestation, you will have an economic impact.": 1,
    " than because you're not having economic activities or something like that.": 1,
    "But it's interesting to know that it's quite the opposite.": 1,
    "In fact,": 1,
    " On the period that we have the deepest decline on deforestation, the economy grows in average double than on the previous decade when deforestation was actually going up.": 1,
    " So it's a good lesson for us.": 1,
    "Maybe this is completely disconnected and we just learn by having the first station come down.": 1,
    " Now these are all good news and it's quite an achievement and we obviously should be very proud about that.": 1,
    "But it's not even close to sufficient.": 1,
    " In fact, if you think about the deforestation in the Amazon in 2013, that was over half a million actors.": 1,
    "It means that every minute": 1,
    " an area the size of two soccer fields has been cut in the Amazon last year, just last year.": 1,
    " If we sum up the deforestation that we have in the other biomas in Brazil, we are talking about still the largest deforestation rate in the world.": 1,
    " It's more or less like we are forest heroes, but still deforestation champions.": 1,
    " So we can't be satisfied, not even close to satisfied.": 1,
    "So the next step, I think, is to fight to have zero loss of forest cover in Brazil.": 1,
    " and to have that as a goal for 2020.": 1,
    "That's our next step.": 1,
    "Now, I've always been interested in the relationship of climate change and forests.": 1,
    "First, because": 1,
    " 15% of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation, so it's a big part of the problem.": 1,
    "But also, forests can be a big part of the solution, since that's the best way we know to sink": 1,
    " capture and store carbon.": 1,
    "Now, there is another relationship of climate and forest that really struck me in 2008 and made me change my career from forest to working with climate change.": 1,
    " I went to visit Canada and British Columbia together with the chiefs of forest services of other countries that we have a kind of alliance of them, like Canada, Russia, India, China, US.": 1,
    " And while we were there, we learned about this pine beetle that is literally eating the forest in Canada.": 1,
    "What we see here, those brown trees, these are really dead trees.": 1,
    " standing dead trees because of the larva of this beetle.": 1,
    "What happens is that this beetle is controlled by the cold weather in the winter.": 1,
    " But for many years now, they don't have the sufficient cold weather to actually control the population of this beetle and it became a disease that is really killing billions of trees.": 1,
    " So I came back with this notion that forest is actually one of the earliest and most affected victims of climate change.": 1,
    " So I was thinking, if I succeed in working with all my colleagues to actually help to stop deforestation, maybe we will lose the battle later on for climate change.": 1,
    " I think by floods, heat, fires, and so on.": 1,
    "So I decided to leave the forest service and start to work directly on climate change.": 1,
    "Find ways to think, understand the challenge, and go for them.": 1,
    " Now, so the challenge of climate change is pretty straightforward.": 1,
    "The goal is very clear.": 1,
    "We want to limit the increase of the average temperature in the planet in two degrees.": 1,
    " There are several reasons for that, I will not get into that now.": 1,
    "But in order to get to this limit of two degrees, which was possible for us to survive,": 1,
    " The IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, defines that we have a budget of emissions of 1,000 billion tons of CO2 from now to the end of the century.": 1,
    " So if we divide this by the number of years, what we have is an average budget of 11 billion tons of CO2 per year.": 1,
    " Now, what is one ton of CO2?": 1,
    "It's more or less what one small car running 20 kilometers a day will emit in one year.": 1,
    " or it's one flight, one way from S\u00e3o Paulo to Johannesburg or to London.": 1,
    "One way.": 1,
    "Two ways, two tons.": 1,
    "So 11 billion tons is twice that.": 1,
    "Now,": 1,
    " The emissions today are 50 billion tons, and it's growing.": 1,
    "It's growing, and maybe we'll be on 61 by 2020.": 1,
    "Now, we need to go down to 10 by 2050.": 1,
    " And while this happens, the population will grow from 7 to 9 billion people.": 1,
    "The economy will grow from $60 trillion in 2010 to $200 trillion.": 1,
    " And so what we need to do is to be much more efficient in a way that we can go from seven tons of carbon per capita per person per year into something like one.": 1,
    "You have to choose.": 1,
    " You take the airplane or you have a car.": 1,
    " So the question is, can we make it?": 1,
    "And that's exactly the same question I got when I was developing the plan to combat deforestation.": 1,
    "It's got so big problem, so complex, can we really do it?": 1,
    " I think so.": 1,
    "Think of this.": 1,
    "Deforestation means 60% of the greenhouse gas emissions in Brazil in the last decade.": 1,
    "Now it's a little bit less than 30%.": 1,
    "In the world, 60% is energy.": 1,
    " So if we can tackle directly the energy the same way we could tackle deforestation, maybe we can have a chance.": 1,
    " So there are five things that I think we should do.": 1,
    "First, we need to disconnect development from carbon emissions.": 1,
    "We don't need to clear cut all the forests.": 1,
    " to actually get more jobs in agriculture and have more economy.": 1,
    "That's what we prove when we decrease deforestation, the economy continues to grow.": 1,
    "Same things could happen in the energy sector.": 1,
    " Second, we have to move the incentives to the right place.": 1,
    "Today, $500 billion a year goes into subsidies to fossil fuels.": 1,
    " Why don't we put a price on carbon and transfer this to the renewable energy?": 1,
    "Third, we need to measure and make it transparent where, when and who is emitting greenhouse gases.": 1,
    " so we can have actions specific to each one of those opportunities.": 1,
    "Fourth, we need to leapfrog the roots of development.": 1,
    " which means you don't need to go to a land-wide telephone before you get to the mobile phones.": 1,
    "Same way, we don't need to go to fossil fuels to the 1 billion people that don't have access to energy before we get to the clean energy.": 1,
    " And fifth and last, we need to share responsibilities between governments, business and civil society.": 1,
    "There are work to do for everybody and we need to have everybody on board.": 1,
    "So to finalize, I think...": 1,
    " You know, future is not like a fate that you have just to go as business as usual goes.": 1,
    "We need to have the courage to actually change the route.": 1,
    " testing something new.": 1,
    "Think that we can actually change the route.": 1,
    "I think we are doing this with deforestation in Brazil, and I hope we can do it also with climate change in the world.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
