    " I've spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation, hopefully for a good cause, which is self-improvement.": 1,
    " I've done this in three parts.": 1,
    "So first I started with the mind and I decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica": 1,
    " from A to Z, or more precisely from Aak to Zibi\u010d.": 1,
    "And here's a little image of that.": 1,
    "And this was an amazing year.": 1,
    "It was really a fascinating journey.": 1,
    " It was painful at times, especially for those around me.": 1,
    "My wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation.": 1,
    " It had its downsides.": 1,
    "But after that...": 1,
    " I decided to work on the spirit.": 1,
    "As I mentioned last year, I grew up with no religion at all.": 1,
    "I'm Jewish, but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.": 1,
    " Not really, but I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it.": 1,
    " So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible and from the Ten Commandments to growing my beard because Leviticus says you cannot shave.": 1,
    "So this is what I looked like by the end.": 1,
    " Thank you for that reaction.": 1,
    "Yeah, I look a little like Moses or Ted Kaczynski.": 1,
    "I got them.": 1,
    "I got both of them.": 1,
    " So there's the the topiary there and yeah there's the sheep.": 1,
    "Now the final part of the trilogy was I wanted to focus on the body.": 1,
    " and try to be the healthiest person I could be, the healthiest person alive.": 1,
    "So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years, and I just finished a couple of months ago, and I have to say thank God, because living so healthily was killing me.": 1,
    " It was so overwhelming because the amount of things you have to do, it's just mind-boggling.": 1,
    "I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisors and they were telling me,": 1,
    " All the things I had to do, I had to eat, ride, exercise, meditate, pet dogs, because that lowers the blood pressure.": 1,
    "I wrote the book on a treadmill.": 1,
    "It took me about a thousand miles to write the book.": 1,
    " I had to put on sunscreen.": 1,
    "This was no small feat because if you listen to dermatologists, they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen and you have to reapply it every two to four hours.": 1,
    "So I think half of my book advance": 1,
    " went into sunscreen.": 1,
    "I was like a glazed donut for most of the year.": 1,
    "There was the washing of hands.": 1,
    "I had to do that properly.": 1,
    "And my immunologist told me that I should also, I have to wipe down": 1,
    " all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house because those are just orgies of germs.": 1,
    "So that took a lot of time.": 1,
    " I also tried to be the safest person I could be because that's a part of health.": 1,
    "I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council.": 1,
    "They started a public campaign that says a walking helmet is a good helmet.": 1,
    " So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking, but also for walking around.": 1,
    "And you can see.": 1,
    " You can see they're shopping with their helmets.": 1,
    "So yeah, I tried that.": 1,
    " Now, it's a little extreme, I admit, but if you think about this, this is actually the Freakonomics authors wrote about this, that more people die on a per-mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving.": 1,
    " So something to think about tonight if you've had a couple.": 1,
    " So I finished, and it was a success in a sense.": 1,
    "All of the markers went in the right direction.": 1,
    "I lost, my cholesterol went down, I lost weight, my wife started, stop.": 1,
    " telling me that I looked pregnant so that was nice and it was successful over": 1,
    " all but I also learned that I was too healthy and that was unhealthy.": 1,
    "I was so focused on doing all these things that I was neglecting my friends and family and and as Dan Buettner can tell you": 1,
    " Having a strong social network is so crucial to our health.": 1,
    "So I finished and I kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over.": 1,
    "I went to the dark side.": 1,
    " and I just indulged myself.": 1,
    "It was like something out of Caligula.": 1,
    " Without the sex part, because I have three young kids, so that wasn't happening.": 1,
    " But the overeating and the over drinking, definitely.": 1,
    "And I finally have stabilized.": 1,
    "So now I'm back to adopting many of, not all, I don't wear a helmet anymore, but": 1,
    " a lot of the dozens of the healthy behaviors that I adopted during my year.": 1,
    "It was really a life-changing project and I of course don't have time to go into": 1,
    " All of them, let me just tell you two really quickly.": 1,
    "The first is, and this was surprising to me, I didn't expect this to come out, but I live a much quieter life now.": 1,
    " Because we live in such a noisy world, you know, it's so noisy.": 1,
    "There's trains and planes and cars and Bill O'Reilly, he's very noisy.": 1,
    " And this is a real underestimated, underappreciated health hazard, not just because it harms our hearing, which it obviously does, but it actually": 1,
    " initiates the fight or flight response.": 1,
    "A loud noise will get your fight or flight response going and this over the years.": 1,
    " can cause real damage, cardiovascular damage.": 1,
    "The World Health Organization just did a big study that they published this year, and it said it was done in Europe, and they estimated that 1.6 million years": 1,
    " of healthy living are lost every year in Europe because of noise pollution, so they think it's actually very deadly.": 1,
    " So, I have\u2014and by the way, it's also terrible for your brain.": 1,
    "You know, it really impairs cognition.": 1,
    "And our founding fathers knew about this.": 1,
    "When they wrote the Constitution, they put": 1,
    " a dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate, so without noise reduction technology.": 1,
    " our country would not exist.": 1,
    "So as a patriot, I felt, you know, it was important to, I wear all the earplugs and the earphones, and it's really improved my life in a surprising and unexpected way.": 1,
    " And the second point I want to make, the final point is that, and it's actually been a theme of TED Med, that joy is so important to your health.": 1,
    " that none of these behaviors, very few of these behaviors, will stick with me unless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them.": 1,
    " And just to give you one instance of this, food.": 1,
    " Junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what's the most pleasurable.": 1,
    "But I think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food.": 1,
    " To give just one example, we love crunchiness, mouthfeel, so I basically have tried to": 1,
    " incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes, throw in some sunflower seeds, and you can almost trick yourself into thinking you're eating Doritos.": 1,
    " It has made me a healthier person.": 1,
    "So that is it.": 1,
    "The book about it comes out in April.": 1,
    "It's called Drop Dead Healthy.": 1,
    "And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour.": 1,
    "That's my greatest hope.": 1,
    "So thank you very much.": 1
