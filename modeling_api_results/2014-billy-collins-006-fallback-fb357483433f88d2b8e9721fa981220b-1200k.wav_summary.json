    " Thank you.": 2,
    " I don't know if you've noticed, but there's been a spate of books that have come out lately contemplating or speculating on the cognition and emotional life of dogs.": 1,
    " Do they think?": 1,
    "Do they feel?": 1,
    "And if so, how?": 1,
    "So this afternoon, in my limited time, I wanted to take the guesswork out of a lot of that by introducing you to two dogs, both of whom have taken the command, speak,": 1,
    " Quite literally.": 1,
    " The first dog is the first to go, and he is contemplating an aspect of his relationship to his owner, and the title is A Dog on His Master.": 1,
    " As young as I look, I am growing older faster than he.": 1,
    "Seven to one is the ratio they tend to say.": 1,
    " Whatever the number, I will pass him one day and take the lead the way I do on our walks in the woods.": 1,
    "And if this ever manages to cross his mind,": 1,
    " it would be the sweetest shadow I have ever cast on snow or grass.": 1,
    " And our next dog.": 1,
    " speaks in something called the revenant, which means a spirit that comes back to visit you.": 1,
    " I am the dog you put to sleep, as you like to call the needle of oblivion.": 1,
    "Come back to tell you this simple thing.": 1,
    "I never liked you.": 1,
    " When I licked your face, I thought of biting off your nose.": 1,
    "When I watched you toweling yourself dry, I wanted to leap and unmanned you with a snap.": 1,
    " I resented the way you moved, your lack of animal grace, the way you would sit in a chair to eat, a napkin on your lap, a knife in your hand.": 1,
    " I would have run away, but I was too weak.": 1,
    "A trick you taught me while I was learning to sit and heal, and greatest of insults, shake hands without a hand.": 1,
    " I admit the sight of the leash would excite me, but only because it meant I was about to smell things you had never touched.": 1,
    " You do not want to believe this, but I have no reason to lie.": 1,
    "I hated the car, hated the rubber toys, disliked your friends and, worse, your relatives.": 1,

    "You always scratched me in the wrong place.": 1,
    " All I ever wanted from you is food and water in my bowls.": 1,
    "While you slept, I watched you breathe as the moon rose in the sky.": 1,
    "It took all of my strength not to raise my head and howl.": 1,
    " Now I am free of the collar, free of the yellow raincoat, monogram sweater, the absurdity of your lawn.": 1,
    " And that is all you need to know about this place, except what you already supposed and are glad it did not happen sooner.": 1,
    " that everyone here can read and write.": 1,
    "The dogs in poetry, the cats and all the others in prose.": 1
