    " So the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one.": 1,
    "Although of course now we don't have to change a plug.": 1,
    "Now we've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric.": 1,
    "Fantastic, you know, and it inspires us.": 1,

    "But you do meet some fantastic people and people who look at the world in a totally different way.": 1,
    "Yesterday David Deutsch, another one who covered most of what I was going to say.": 1,

    "I mean, you must walk in and they will say, would you like a macchiato or a latte or an Americano or a cappuccino?": 1,
    " and he'll say, you're offering me things that are infinitely variable.": 1,

    "Fantastic, really good.": 1,
    "Her talk about the aquatic ape and the link, of course, the link between Darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this, but not her suit and we can swim rather well.": 1,
    " She said, you know, she's 90 she's running out of time.": 1,
    "She said and she's desperate to find more evidence for the link And I think I'm sitting next to Lewis pew": 1,
    " This man has swum around the North Pole.": 1,
    "What more evidence do you want?": 1,
    " And there he is.": 1,
    "That's how Ted brings these connections together.": 1,

    " I'm so sorry.": 1,
    "I'm so sorry.": 1,

    " the large coal-fired power station we're building at Kings North, and of course the exciting news that only today, only this week,": 1,

    " British jobs for Scottish people.": 1,
    " Christian principles, Christian values, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.": 1,

    " Yeah, all right, come on.": 1,
    "All right, Gordon, come on.": 1,
    "Can I just say a few things about, you know, firstly about Sheree, because she's a wonderful lady, you know.": 1,
    " and my wife with a wonderful smile.": 1,
    "That reminds me, I must post that letter.": 1,
    " I just think, you know, what people forget, you know, Gordon and I, we always got on perfectly well.": 1,
    "All right, it's never exactly broke that mountain, but...": 1,
    " You know, I wrote to him just before I left office.": 1,
    "I said, you know, can I rely on your support for the next month?": 1,
    "And he wrote back.": 1,
    "He said, no, you can't.": 1,
    "Which kind of surprised me because I'd never seen can't spelt that way before.": 1,
    " Another thing Gordon of course could have mentioned in his speech to the Mansion House in 2002 that was the building the people weren't listening but the people went talking about the financial industry he said": 1,
    " What you as a city of London have done for financial services, we as a government hope to do for the economy as a whole.": 1,
    " When you think what's happened to financial services and you see what's happened to the economy, you think, well there's a man who delivers on his promises.": 1,
    " But we're in a new world now.": 1,
    "We're in a completely new world.": 1,
    "This is the first time that I can remember where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan, you don't know if you're borrowing money from him or he's borrowing money from you.": 1,
    "Am I right?": 1,
    "These extraordinary things.": 1,
    "Icelandic internet accounts.": 1,
    "Did anyone here have an Icelandic internet account?": 1,

    "Asking for all your bank details.": 1,
    "And, you know, Iceland, it was never going to cut it.": 1,
    "It didn't have that kind of collateral.": 1,
    "What does it have?": 1,
    "It has fish.": 1,
    " That's all.": 1,
    "That's why the Prime Minister went on television.": 1,
    "He said, this has left us all with a very big headache.": 1,
    " A lot of what I do, I have to try and make sense of things before I can make nonsense of them.": 1,
    "And making sense of the financial crisis is very, very difficult.": 1,

    "He summed it up, really, in a dinner.": 1,
    "He was speaking at a dinner.": 1,
    "He said, Wall Street got drunk.": 1,
    " And now it's got a hangover.": 1,
    " And that's something, you know.": 1,
    " That's...": 1,
    " That's something we can relate to.": 1,
    "Something he can relate to.": 1,
    " And the other one, of course, is Donald Rumsfeld, who said, you know, there are the known knowns, the things we know we know.": 1,
    "And then you got the known unknowns, the things we know we don't know.": 1,
    " And then you got the unknown, unknown.": 1,
    "So those are the things we don't know, we don't know.": 1,
    "And you know, being English, when I first heard that, I thought, what a lot of cock.": 1,
    "And then...": 1,
    " You now, you realize, well actually, you know, that's what this is about.": 1,
    "This whole, what Ben Bernanke has said, the chaotic unwinding of the world's financial system.": 1,
    " It's about, they don't know, they didn't know what they were doing.": 1,
    "In 2006 the American, the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said, quote,": 1,
    " As we can clearly see, no seismic occurrence is about to overwhelm the US economy.": 1,
    "Now there's a man on top of his job.": 1,
    " And when the crisis was happening, the head of quantitative equities at Lehman Brothers said, events which models predicted would happen once every 10,000 years happened every day for three days.": 1,
    " So it's extraordinary.": 1,
    "It's a new world.": 1,
    "It's very, very difficult to make sense of.": 1,
    "But we have new hope.": 1,
    "We have a new man.": 1,
    "America has now elected its first openly black president.": 1,
    " Wonderful news.": 1,
    "Not only that, he's left-handed, have you noticed this?": 1,
    "How many people here are left-handed?": 1,
    " You see, a lot of the people that I most admire, they're great artists, great designers, great thinkers, they're left-handed.": 1,
    "And somebody said to me last night, yeah, being left-handed, you have to learn to write without smudging the ink.": 1,
    " And somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday, and I thought, what a wonderful metaphor, isn't it?": 1,
    "An American president who has to write without smudging the ink.": 1,
    "You like that one?": 1,
    " as opposed to, you can see, George Bush, where, well, what's the metaphor there?": 1,
    "I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing, wouldn't it?": 1,
    "Well, you know, I'm sorry about that.": 1,
    "I'm right-handed, but I seem to have smudged that ink as well.": 1,
    " But you know, he's gone.": 1,
    "Now he's gone.": 1,
    "That's eight years of American history, eight minutes of my act, just gone like that.": 1,
    "You know, it's the end of an era.": 1,
    "I happen to believe it was a great era.": 1,
    " I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the United States, but we proved them wrong in Iraq.": 1,
    "They said there was no link between Iraq and Al-Qaeda.": 1,
    " There is now.": 1,
    " But I have a message for the suicide bombers, for those people who have blown themselves up.": 1,
    " We're going to find you.": 1,
    " We're going to make sure you don't do it again.": 1,
    "But now he's gone.": 1,

    "You were there maybe on the night of his victory and he spoke to the crowd in Chicago.": 1,
    "He said,": 1,
    " if there is anyone out there.": 1,
    " who still doubts.": 1,
    " that America is a place.": 1,
    " where all things are possible.": 1,
    " I can't do the whole thing because it would take too long, it really would.": 1,
    "And then it goes to the inauguration and he and the Chief Justice, they trip over each other, they get the words wrong and they screw the thing up.": 1,
    "And there's George Bush sitting there going, ha ha ha ha.": 1,
    " Not so easy, is it?": 1,
    " But the interesting thing is, Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero, who said that people would listen to her speech and they'd say, great speech, and then they'd listen to Demosthenes and they'd say, let's march.": 1,
    " And the great thing, we all want to believe in President Obama.": 1,
    "It's rather like that line in the film, as good as it gets.": 1,
    "You remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson, and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson, what do you see in me?": 1,
    "And Jack Nicholson just says,": 1,
    " You make me want to be a better man.": 1,
    " And you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen, right?": 1,
    "But at the moment, it's the Cicero thing.": 1,
    "We like what Barack Obama says, but we don't do anything about it.": 1,

    "Absolutely not.": 1,
    "Nothing happens.": 1,
    "He goes to Strasbourg.": 1,
    "He says, we need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan.": 1,
    " And everyone goes, great idea.": 1,
    "He leaves.": 1,
    "People go, no, no, no, we're not going to do that.": 1,

    "No, no, we're not going to do that.": 1,
    "He goes to Prague.": 1,
    "He says, we believe in a nuclear free world.": 1,
    "And it's great to have an American president who could say the word nuclear.": 1,
    "Let's just point that out first.": 1,
    " Remember that George, a nuclear, a nuclear.": 1,
    " No, could you say, could you say avancular?": 1,
    "Avanclear.": 1,
    " thank you very much but he says we want a nuclear free world and that day North Korea that very day North Korea is just seeing if it can just get one over Japan and": 1,
    " So where do we look for inspiration?": 1,
    "We still got Bill Clinton who travels the world.": 1,
    " I believe, I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said,": 1,

    " somebody's glad hand.": 1,
    " make this world a better place, if you can.": 1,
    "I just think that's important.": 1,
    "I really do.": 1,
    "And I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House because she'd have been out of our home for four years and I, you know...": 1,

    "I mean it's so important.": 1,
    "All we can do.": 1,
