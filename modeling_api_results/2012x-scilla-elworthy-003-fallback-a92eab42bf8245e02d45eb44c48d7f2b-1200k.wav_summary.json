    " In half a century of trying to help prevent wars, there's one question that never leaves me.": 1,
    "How do we deal with extreme violence without using force in return?": 1,
    " When you're faced with brutality, whether it's a child facing a bully in the playground or domestic violence, or on the streets of Syria today facing tanks and shrapnel, what's the most effective thing to do?": 1,
    " Fight back.": 1,
    "Give in.": 1,
    " Use more force.": 1,
    " This question, how do I deal with the bully without becoming a thug in return, has been with me ever since I was a child.": 1,
    "I remember I was about 13, glued": 1,
    " to grainy black and white television in my parents' living room as Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest.": 1,
    " and kids not much older than me were throwing themselves at the tanks and getting moaned down.": 1,
    " And I rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase and my mother came up and said, what on earth are you doing?": 1,
    "And I said, I'm going to Budapest.": 1,
    " And she said, what on earth for?": 1,
    "And I said, kids are getting killed.": 1,
    "There's something terrible happening.": 1,
    "And she said, don't be so silly.": 1,
    " And I started to cry.": 1,
    "And she got it.": 1,
    "She said, OK, I see it's serious.": 1,
    "You're much too young to help.": 1,
    "You need training.": 1,
    "I'll help you, but just unpack your suitcase.": 1,
    " And so I got some training and went and worked in Africa during most of my twenties.": 1,
    "But I realized that what I really needed to know I couldn't get from training courses.": 1,
    " I wanted to understand how violence, how oppression works.": 1,
    "And what I've discovered since is this.": 1,
    " Bullies use violence in three ways.": 1,
    " They use political violence to intimidate.": 1,
    " Physical violence to terrorise.": 1,
    " and mental or emotional violence to undermine.": 1,
    " And only very rarely, in very few cases, does it work to use more violence.": 1,
    "Nelson Mandela went to jail believing in violence.": 1,
    " And 27 years later, he and his colleagues had slowly and carefully honed the skills": 1,
    " the incredible skills that they needed to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known into a democracy.": 1,
    "And they did it in a total devotion to nonviolence.": 1,
    " They realized that using force against force doesn't work.": 1,
    " So what does work?": 1,
    "Over time, I've collected about half a dozen methods that do work.": 1,
    "Of course, there are many more that do work and that are effective.": 1,
    " And the first is that the change that has to take place has to take place here inside me.": 1,
    "It's my response, my attitude to oppression.": 1,
    " that I've got control over, that I can do something about.": 1,
    "And what I need to develop is self-knowledge to do that.": 1,
    "That means I need to know how I tick, when I collapse, where my": 1,
    " formidable points are and where my weaker points are.": 1,
    "When do I give in?": 1,
    "What will I stand up for?": 1,
    " And meditation or self-inspection is one of the ways of gaining, it's not the only one, one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power.": 1,
    " And my heroine here, like Satish, is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma.": 1,
    " She was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of Rangoon.": 1,
    "They came round a corner, faced with a row of machine guns.": 1,
    " And she realized straight away that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers were more scared than the student protesters behind her.": 1,
    "But she told the students to sit down.": 1,
    " and she walked forward with such calm and such clarity and such total lack of fear.": 1,
    " that she could walk right up to the first gun, put her hand on it and lower it.": 1,
    " and no one got killed.": 1,
    " So that's what the mastery of fear can do.": 1,
    "Not only faced with machine guns, but if you meet a knife fight in the streets.": 1,
    " that we have to practice.": 1,
    "So what about our fear?": 1,
    " I have a little mantra.": 1,
    " My fear grows fat on the energy I feed it.": 1,
    "And if it grows very big, it probably happens.": 1,
    " So we all know the three o'clock in the morning syndrome, when something you've been worrying about wakes you up.": 1,
    "I see a lot of people.": 1,
    " And for an hour you toss and turn, it gets worse and worse, and by four o'clock you're pinned to the pillow by a monster this big.": 1,
    " The only thing to do is to get up, make a cup of tea and sit down with the fear like a child beside you.": 1,
    " You're the adult.": 1,
    "The fear is the child.": 1,
    "And you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants, what it needs.": 1,
    "How can this be made better?": 1,
    "How can the child feel stronger?": 1,
    " And you make a plan and you say, okay, now we're going back to sleep, half past seven we're getting up and that's what we're going to do.": 1,
    " I had one of these 3 a.m.": 1,
    "episodes on Sunday, paralyzed with fear of coming to talk to you.": 1,
    " So I did the thing, I got up, made the cup of tea, sat down with it digital, and I'm here.": 1,
    "Still partly paralysed, but I'm here.": 1,
    " So that's fear.": 1,
    "What about anger?": 1,
    "Wherever there's injustice, there's anger.": 1,
    "But anger is like gasoline.": 1,
    "And if you spray it around and somebody lights a match, you've got an inferno.": 1,
    " But anger as an engine, in an engine, is powerful.": 1,
    "If we can put our anger inside an engine, it can drive us forward, it can get us through the dreadful moments.": 1,
    " and it can give us real inner power.": 1,
    "And I learned this in my work with nuclear weapon policy makers because at the beginning I was so outraged at the dangers they were exposing us to.": 1,
    " that I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong.": 1,
    " totally ineffective.": 1,
    "In order to develop a dialogue for change, we have to deal with our anger.": 1,
    " angry with the thing, the nuclear weapons in this case, but it is hopeless to be angry with the people.": 1,
    " They are human beings just like us.": 1,
    "They're doing what they think is best and that's the basis on which we have to talk with them.": 1,
    " So that's the third one, anger.": 1,
    "And it brings me to the crux of what's going on, or what I perceive is going on in the world today, which is that.": 1,
    " Last century was top-down power.": 1,
    "There were still governments telling people what to do.": 1,
    "This century there's a shift.": 1,
    " It's bottom-up or grassroots power.": 1,
    "It's like mushrooms coming through concrete.": 1,
    " It's people joining up with people, as Bundy just said, miles away to bring about change.": 1,
    " And Peace Direct spotted quite early on that local people in areas of very hot conflict": 1,
    " know what to do.": 1,
    "They know best what to do.": 1,
    "So Pistarek gets behind them to do that.": 1,
    " And the kind of thing they're doing is demobilizing militias, rebuilding economies, resettling refugees,": 1,
    " even liberating child soldiers.": 1,
    "And they have to risk their lives almost every day to do this.": 1,
    " and um...": 1,
    " What they realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less humane, but it's less effective.": 1,
    " than using methods that connect people with people, that rebuild.": 1,
    " And I think that the US military is finally beginning to get this.": 1,
    "Up to now, their counter-terrorism policy": 1,
    " has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost.": 1,
    "And if civilians get in the way, that's written as collateral damage.": 1,
    " And this is so infuriating and humiliating for the population of Afghanistan.": 1,
    " that it makes recruitment for al-Qaeda very easy when people are so disgusted by, for example, the burning of the Quran.": 1,
    " So the training of the troops has to change.": 1,
    "And I think there are signs that it is beginning to change.": 1,
    " The British military have always been much better at this.": 1,
    "But there's one magnificent example for them to take their cue from and that's a brilliant US Lieutenant Colonel called Chris Hughes.": 1,
    " and he was leading his men down the streets of Najaf in Iraq actually.": 1,
    " And suddenly people were pouring out of the houses on either side of the road, screaming, yelling, furiously angry, and surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified.": 1,
    " didn't know what was going on, couldn't speak Arabic.": 1,
    "And Chris Hughes strode into the middle of the throne with his weapon above his head, pointing at the ground, and he said,": 1,
    " and these huge soldiers with their backpacks and their body armour wobbled to the ground.": 1,
    " and complete silence fell.": 1,
    " And after about two minutes, everybody moved aside and went home.": 1,
    " Now, that to me is wisdom in action.": 1,
    " in the moment.": 1,
    "That's what he did.": 1,
    " And it's happening everywhere now.": 1,
    " You don't believe me?": 1,
    "Have you asked yourselves?": 1,
    " why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed over the last 30 years.": 1,
    " dictatorships in": 1,
    " Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Mali, Madagascar,": 1,
    " Poland, the Philippines, Serbia, Slovenia.": 1,
    "I could go on.": 1,
    "And now Tunisia and Egypt.": 1,
    " And this hasn't just happened, you know.": 1,
    " A lot of it is due to a book written by an 80-year-old man in Boston, Gene Sharp.": 1,
    " He wrote a book called From Dictatorship to Democracy with 81 methodologies for non-violent resistance.": 1,
    " and it's been translated into 26 languages, it's flown around the world and it's being used by young people and older people everywhere.": 1,
    " because it works and it's effective.": 1,
    " So this is what gives me hope, not just hope, this is what makes me feel very positive right now because finally human beings are getting it.": 1,
    "We're getting": 1,
    " We're getting practical, doable methodologies to answer my question.": 1,
    "How do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug?": 1,
    " We're using the kind of skills that I've outlined.": 1,
    " inner power, development of inner power through self-knowledge, recognizing and working with our fear, using anger as a fuel, cooperating with others,": 1,
    " banding together with others, courage.": 1,
    " and most importantly, commitment to active non-violence.": 1,
    " I don't just believe in non-violence.": 1,
    "I don't have to believe in it.": 1,
    "I see evidence everywhere of how it works.": 1,
    "And I see that we...": 1,
    " Ordinary people can do what Aung San Suu Kyi and Gandhi and Mandela did.": 1,
    " we can bring to an end the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known.": 1,
    " and we can organize to overcome oppression": 1,
    " by opening our hearts as well as...": 1,
    " strengthening this incredible resolve.": 1,
    "And this open-heartedness is exactly what I've experienced in the entire organization of this gathering since I got here yesterday.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
