    " Back in New York, I am the head of development for a nonprofit called Robin Hood.": 1,
    "When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.": 1,
    " Now, in our town where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff, you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action.": 1,
    " I remember my first fire.": 1,
    "I was the second volunteer on the scene, so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.": 1,
    "But still, it was a real foot race against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be.": 1,
    " When I found the captain, he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.": 1,
    "Here it was the middle of the night.": 1,
    "She was standing outside in the pouring rain.": 1,
    " under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot while her house was in flames.": 1,
    " The other volunteer who had arrived just before me, let's call him Lex Luther.": 1,
    " got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog.": 1,
    "The dog!": 1,
    " I was stunned with jealousy.": 1,
    "Here was some lawyer or money manager who for the rest of his life gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature.": 1,
    "Just because he beat me by five seconds.": 1,
    "Well, I was next.": 1,
    " The captain waved me over.": 1,
    "I said, Bezos, I need you to go into the house.": 1,
    "I need you to go upstairs, past the fire, and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes.": 1,
    " I swear.": 1,
    " So...": 1,
    " Not exactly what I was hoping for, but off I went.": 1,
    " up the stairs, down the hall, past the real firefighters who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point, into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes.": 1,
    "Now, I know what you're thinking.": 1,
    " but I'm no hero.": 1,
    " I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door.": 1,
    " We took our treasures outside to the homeowner where, not surprisingly, his received much more attention than that did mine.": 1,
    "A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home.": 1,
    " the act of kindness she noted above all others.": 1,
    " Someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes.": 1,
    " You know, in both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter, I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale.": 1,
    "But I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis.": 1,
    " And you know what I've learned?": 1,
    "They all matter.": 1,
    " So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved or are on their way to achieving remarkable levels of success, I would offer this reminder.": 1,
    " Don't wait.": 1,
    " Don't wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody's life.": 1,
    "If you have something to give, give it now.": 1,
    " serve food in a soup kitchen, clean up a neighborhood park, be a mentor.": 1,
    " Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody's life, but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one.": 1,
    "So get in the game.": 1,
    "Save the shoes.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
