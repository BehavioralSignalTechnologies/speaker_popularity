    "We had done it.": 2,
    " Let's go south.": 1,
    " All of you.": 1,
    " are actually going south.": 1,
    "This is the direction of south.": 1,
    "This way.": 1,
    " And if you go 8,000 kilometers out of the back of this room, you will come to as far south as you can go anywhere on earth, the pole itself.": 1,
    "Now I am not": 1,
    " an explorer.": 1,
    " I'm not an environmentalist.": 1,
    "I'm actually just a survivor.": 1,
    " And these photographs that I'm showing you here are dangerous.": 1,
    "They are the ice melt of the South and North Poles.": 1,
    " Ladies and gentlemen, we need to listen to what these places are telling us.": 1,
    " And if we don't, we will end up with our own survival situation here on planet Earth.": 1,
    " I have faced...": 1,
    " head on these places and to walk across a melting ocean of ice is without doubt the most frightening thing that's ever happened to me.": 1,
    " Antarctica is such a hopeful place.": 1,
    "It is protected by the Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959.": 1,
    " In 1991, a 50-year agreement was entered into that stops any exploitation in Antarctica.": 1,
    " And this agreement could be altered, changed, modified, or even abandoned starting in the year 2041.": 1,
    " Ladies and gentlemen,": 1,
    " People already far up north from here in the Arctic are already taking advantage of this ice melt.": 1,
    " taking out resources from areas already": 1,
    " that have been covered in ice for the last 10, 20, 30 thousand, 100 thousand years.": 1,
    "Can they not join the dots?": 1,
    " and think, why is the ice actually melting?": 1,
    " This is such an amazing place, the Antarctic.": 1,
    "And I have worked hard for the last 23 years": 1,
    " on this mission to make sure that what's happening up here in the north does never happen, cannot happen in the south.": 1,
    " Where did this all begin?": 1,
    "It began for me at the age of 11.": 1,
    "Check out that haircut.": 1,
    "It's a bit odd.": 1,
    " And at the age of 11, I was inspired by the real explorers to want to try and be the first to walk to both poles.": 1,
    "I found it incredibly inspiring.": 1,
    " that the idea of becoming a polar traveller went down pretty well with girls at parties when I was at university.": 1,
    "That was a bit more inspiring.": 1,
    " And after years, seven years of fundraising, seven years of being told no, seven years of being told by my family to seek counselling and psychiatric help,": 1,
    " Eventually, three of us found ourselves marching to the South Geographic Pole on the longest unassisted march ever made anywhere on earth in history in this photograph.": 1,
    " We are standing in an area the size of the United States of America.": 1,
    "And we're on our own.": 1,
    "We have no radio communications, no backup.": 1,
    "Beneath our feet.": 1,
    " 90% of all the world's ice, 70% of all the world's fresh water, we're standing on it.": 1,
    "This is the power.": 1,
    " of Antarctica.": 1,
    "On this journey we faced the danger of crevasses, intense cold, so cold": 1,
    " that sweat turns to ice inside your clothing, your teeth can crack, water can freeze in your eyes.": 1,
    "Let's just say it's a bit chilly.": 1,
    " And after 70 desperate days, we arrive at the South Pole.": 1,
    "But something happened to me on that 70-day journey in 1986 that brought me here.": 1,
    " and it hurt.": 1,
    "My eyes changed colour.": 1,
    "In 70 days through damage, our faces blistered out, the skin ripped off, and we wondered why.": 1,
    " And when we got home we were told by NASA that a hole in the ozone had been discovered above the South Pole and we'd walked underneath it the same year it had been discovered.": 1,
    " Ultraviolet rays down, hit the ice, bounced back, fried out the eyes, ripped off our faces.": 1,
    " It was a bit of a shock.": 1,
    " And it started me thinking.": 1,
    "In 1989, we now head north.": 1,
    "60 days.": 1,
    " every step away from the safety of land across a frozen ocean.": 1,
    "It was desperately cold again.": 1,
    "Here's me coming in from washing naked at minus 60 Celsius.": 1,
    " And if anybody ever says to you, I am cold, if they look like this, they are cold.": 1,
    "Definitely.": 1,
    " A thousand kilometres, a thousand kilometres away from the safety of land, disaster strikes.": 1,
    " The Arctic Ocean melts beneath our feet, four months before it ever had in history, and we're a thousand kilometres from safety.": 1,
    "The ice is crashing round us, grinding, and I'm thinking,": 1,
    " Are we going to die?": 1,
    "But something clicked in my head on this day is I realized we as a world are in a survival situation.": 1,
    " And that feeling has never gone away for 25 long years.": 1,
    "Back then, we had to march": 1,
    " or die.": 1,
    "And we're not some TV survivor program.": 1,
    "When things go wrong for us, it's life or death.": 1,
    "And our brave African American, Daryl,": 1,
    " who would become the first American to walk to the North Pole, his heel dropped off from frostbite, 200 clicks out.": 1,
    "He must keep going.": 1,
    "He does.": 1,
    "And after 60 days on the ice,": 1,
    " We stood at the North Pole.": 1,
    "Yes, I became the first person in history, stupid enough to walk to both poles, but it was our success.": 1,
    " And sadly, on return home, it was not all fun.": 1,
    " I became very low to succeed at some things, often harder than actually making it happen.": 1,
    "I was empty, lonely, financially destroyed.": 1,
    "I was without hope.": 1,
    " But hope came in the form of the great Jacques Cousteau, and he inspired me to take on the 2041 mission.": 1,
    "Being Jacques, he gave me clear instructions, engaged the world leaders,": 1,
    " Talk to industry and business, and above all, Rob, inspire young people because they will choose the future of the preservation of Antarctica.": 1,
    " We've been to every Earth World Summit, all three of them, with our brave yacht, 2041.": 1,
    "Twice to Rio, once in 92, once in 2012.": 1,
    " And for the Earth Summit in Johannesburg, we made the longest overland voyage ever made with a yacht.": 1,
    " 13,000 kilometres round the whole of Southern Africa, doing our best to inspire over a million young people in person.": 1,
    " about 2041 and about their environment.": 1,
    "For the last 11 years,": 1,
    " We have taken over a thousand people, people from industry and business, women and men from companies, students from all over the world down to Antarctica.": 1,
    " And during those missions, we've managed to pull out over 1,500 tons of twisted metal left in Antarctica.": 1,
    "That took eight years.": 1,
    "And I'm so proud of it because...": 1,
    " We recycled all of it back here in South America.": 1,
    "I have been inspired ever since I could walk to recycle by my mum.": 1,
    "Here she is.": 1,
    "And my mum...": 1,
    " My mom is still recycling and she is in her 100th year.": 1,
    "Isn't that fantastic?": 1,
    " I love my mom.": 1,
    " But when mum was born, when mum was born, the population of our planet...": 1,
    " was only 1.8 billion people.": 1,
    "And talking in terms of billions, we have taken young people from industry and business from India,": 1,
    " from China.": 1,
    "These are game-changing nations and will be hugely important in the decision about the preservation of the Antarctic.": 1,
    " Unbelievably, we've engaged and inspired women to come from the Middle East, often for the first time they've represented their nations in Antarctica.": 1,
    " Fantastic people, so inspired to look after Antarctica.": 1,
    " You've got to first engage people with this extraordinary place.": 1,
    "Form a relationship.": 1,
    "Form a bond.": 1,
    "Form some love.": 1,
    " It is such a privilege to go to Antarctica, I can't tell you.": 1,
    "I feel so lucky.": 1,
    "And I've been 35 times in my life.": 1,
    "And all those people who come with us,": 1,
    " return home as great champions, not only for Antarctica, but for local issues back in their own nations.": 1,
    "Let's go back to where we began.": 1,
    " the ice melt of the North and South Poles, and it's not good news.": 1,
    " NASA informed us six months ago.": 1,
    " that the Western Antarctic ice shelf is now disintegrating.": 1,
    "Huge areas of ice.": 1,
    "Look how big Antarctica is even compared to here.": 1,
    " Huge areas of ice are breaking off from Antarctica, the size of small nations.": 1,
    " And NASA have calculated that the sea level will rise.": 1,
    "It is definite by one meter.": 1,
    " in the next hundred years, the same time that my mum has been on planet Earth.": 1,
    "It's going to happen.": 1,
    "And I've realised that the preservation of Antarctica": 1,
    " and our survival here on earth are linked.": 1,
    " And there is a very simple solution.": 1,
    "If we are using more renewable energy in the real world, if we are being more efficient with the energy here,": 1,
    " running our energy mix in a cleaner way, there will be no financial reason to go and exploit Antarctica.": 1,
    "It won't make financial sense.": 1,
    "And if we manage our energy better,": 1,
    " We also may be able to slow down, maybe even stop, this great ice melt that threatens us.": 1,
    "It's a big challenge, and what is our response to it?": 1,
    " We've got to go back one last time.": 1,
    "And at the end of next year, we will go back to the South Geographic Pole.": 1,
    " where we arrived 30 years ago on foot and retrace our steps of 1,600 kilometres.": 1,
    " but this time only using renewable energy to survive.": 1,
    "We will walk across those ice caps, which far down below are melting.": 1,
    " hopefully inspiring some solutions on that issue.": 1,
    "This is my son, Barney.": 1,
    "He is coming with me.": 1,
    " He's committed to walking side by side with his father and what he will do is to translate these messages.": 1,
    " and inspire these messages to the minds of future young leaders.": 1,
    "I'm extremely proud of him.": 1,
    "Good on him, Barney.": 1,
    " Ladies and gentlemen.": 1,
    " A survivor, and I'm good.": 1,
    " A survivor sees a problem": 1,
    " and doesn't go whatever.": 1,
    "A survivor sees a problem and deals with that problem before it becomes a threat.": 1,
    "We have 27 years": 1,
    " to preserve the Antarctic.": 1,
    "We all own it.": 1,
    " We all have responsibility.": 1,
    "The fact that nobody owns it maybe means that we can succeed.": 1,
    "Antarctica is a moral line in the snow.": 1,
    " And on one side of that line, we should fight, fight hard for this one beautiful, pristine place left alone on earth.": 1,
    "I know it's possible.": 1,
    "We are going to do it.": 1,
    " And I leave you with these words from Goethe.": 1,
    " I've tried to live by them.": 1,
    " if you can do.": 1,
    " or dream you can.": 1,
    " Begin it now.": 1,
    "For boldness has genius, power, and magic in it.": 1,
    "Good luck to you all.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
