    "Why?": 2,
    " Hello.": 1,
    "If you have been following the news in the last few weeks, you may have heard about a crisis between China and the US.": 1,
    " on the issue of computer attacks, whose American Google company would have been the victims.": 1,
    "We talked a lot about this, we talked about CYBARGARE, which is probably just a scourge operation and a relatively bad evidence.": 1,
    " Nevertheless, this episode reveals the growing anxiety in the Western world in the face of the emergence of these cybernetic weapons.": 1,
    " But these weapons are dangerous, they are of a new nature, and they risk to drag the world into an electronic conflict that could turn into an armed confrontation.": 1,
    "Because these virtual weapons also destroy the physical world.": 1,
    " In 1992, at the heart of the Cold War, in the Soviet Siberia,": 1,
    " A pipeline explodes with a detonation of 3 kilotons, equivalent to a quarter of the Hiroshima bomb.": 1,
    "As we know today, this has been revealed by former US Air Force Secretary Ronald Reagan and Thomas Reed.": 1,
    " This explosion is actually the result of the CIA's sabotage operation, which had at the time managed to infiltrate the management systems of this pipeline.": 1,
    "More recently,": 1,
    " The American government revealed that in September 2008, more than 3 million inhabitants of the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil, were plunged into darkness, victims of cyber-piracy.": 1,
    " Well, even more worrying for Americans, in December 2008, the SADESA, the computer system of CENCOM, the command center that today pilot wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which would have been infiltrated by hackers,": 1,
    " SEQR would have used this, the simple key to solve the traps.": 1,
    "And thanks to these keys, you would have been able to introduce yourself in these computer systems, to see everything, all at the same time to trap some of these systems.": 1,
    " So the Americans take the stress very seriously.": 1,
    "I quote here General James Cartwright who is Vice Chairman of the United States General Staff and who says in a report to Congress that cyber attacks could be as powerful as weapons of massive destruction.": 1,
    " Besides, the Americans have decided to spend more than 30 billion dollars in the next 5 years to build their cyberwar capacity.": 1,
    " And around the world, we are today in a kind of cyber race with the units of cyber wars which are built by countries like North Korea or even Iran.": 1,
    " But what you will never hear from the MPs of the French Ministry of Defense is that the problem is not necessarily who is the opponent, but rather the nature itself of these weapons.": 1,
    " And to understand it, we have to see how, over the years, military technologies have managed to make or break the peace of the world.": 1,
    " For example, if we had the chance to have Tedx Paris 350 years ago, we would have talked about the military innovation of the moment, namely the massive fortification of Steve Boban.": 1,
    " and we could have predicted an era of stability in the world or in Europe, which was the case between 1650 and 1750.": 1,
    " Likewise, if we had held this conference 30 or 40 years ago, we could have seen how the advent of nuclear weapons and the threat of the mutual destruction ensured by them prevents a direct conflict between the two superpowers.": 1,
    " However, if we had had this conference 60 years ago, we would have been able to see how the emergence of armed forces and air forces, which give the advantage to the offensive,": 1,
    " makes the doctrine of the blitzkrieg and therefore the possibility of a war in Europe credible.": 1,
    "So military technologies are able to influence the course of the world, to make, to break the peace of the world.": 1,
    "And there is the problem with cyber weapons.": 1,
    " First problem, imagine that a potential opponent announces that he is building a new cyber war capacity, but only for the defense of his country.": 1,
    "Very well, but what distinguishes him from a unit to attack?": 1,
    " And the problem is even more acute when the doctrine of utilization becomes very fluid.": 1,
    " Three years ago, the United States and France both said that they were investing militarily in the cyberspace only for the defense of their computer systems.": 1,
    "But today, these two countries both say that the best defense": 1,
    " It's the attack.": 1,
    "And in this way, they only make us join China, which has been a doctrine of use for 15 years now, both defensive and offensive.": 1,
    " Second problem.": 1,
    "Your country could be attacked by a cyber attack from entire regions plunged into complete darkness.": 1,
    " it is possible that you ignore the same identity of the aggressor.": 1,
    "And cyber weapons will be particular that they can be used without leaving a trace.": 1,
    " And this gives a considerable advantage to the attack, because the part that defends it does not know how to repost.": 1,
    "And if it reposts against the bad opponent, well, it risks becoming an additional enemy and being diplomatically isolated.": 1,
    " is not a theoretical problem.": 1,
    "In May 2007, Estonia was victim of cyberattacks that damaged its communication system and banking system.": 1,
    "Estonia accused Russia.": 1,
    " But time, who defended Estonia, showed itself very carefully.": 1,
    "Because time could not be 100% sure that behind these attacks, the Kremlin's hand was actually hiding.": 1,
    " So to summarize, on the one hand, when a potential opponent announces that he is developing a cyberguard unit, we don't know if it's to prepare the attack or if it's to defend ourselves, and on the other hand, we know that these weapons give the advantage of the attack.": 1,
    " In an important paper from 1978, Professor Robert Jarvis from Columbia University, New York, had created a model to understand how conflicts could emerge.": 1,
    " Or in an environment where we don't know if the potential enemy prepares the defense or the attack.": 1,
    " And if weapons give the advantage to the attack, then this environment is the most likely to trigger a conflict.": 1,
    "And it is the environment that is being created today by cyber weapons and historically": 1,
    " It is the environment of Europe at the eve of the First World War.": 1,
    " Cyberjams, as such, by their nature, are dangerous, but in addition, they emerge in an environment today much more unstable.": 1,
    " If you remember the Cold War, it was a very hard game, but a relatively simple game because there are two players and you can have a form of coordination between the two great ones.": 1,
    " Today we enter a multipolar world, coordination becomes much more complicated, we have seen it with Copenhagen.": 1,
    " And this coordination may become even more difficult to implement with the introduction of cyberweapons.": 1,
    "Because simply, a nation will not know for sure if the neighbor is on the corner or not to attack it.": 1,
    " And nations are at risk of living under the threat of what the Nobel prize of economist Thomas Schelling called the reciprocal fear of surprise attack.": 1,
    "As I do not know if my neighbor is on the point where we attack me, and maybe he will never know,": 1,
    " Well, maybe I'll take the front and be the first to attack.": 1,
    " Not later than this week, in an article dated January 26, 2010 by the New York Times, it was revealed for the first time that officials of the National Security Agency were thinking about the possibility of a preemptive attack": 1,
    " in case America is about to be attacked by a super attack.": 1,
    " and these preemptive attacks and reposts may not remain strictly in the field of cyberspace.": 1,
    " In May 2009, General Kevin Chilton, Commander of the American nuclear forces,": 1,
    " announced that in case of an electronic attack against America, all options were on the table.": 1,
    "Cyber-armament does not make the conventional armament or nuclear armament disappear, it is only added": 1,
    " to the terror device already existing, but in doing so, it adds its own risk of conflict, a very important risk as we see it, and a risk that we may have to face with a collective security solution": 1,
    " Including all of us, of course, the European allies, members of NATO, with our allies and American allies, with our other Western allies, and maybe by forcing them a little bit, our Russian partners and our Chinese partners.": 1,
    " Because the technologies of information, as Joel Dernet said, and which are historically in military research, are now on the verge of developing an offensive capacity for destruction, which could tomorrow, if we take care of it,": 1,
    " to put down and destroy the world.": 1
