    " So I kind of believe that we're in the cave painting era of computer interfaces.": 1,
    "They don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be.": 1,
    "And I like to change all that.": 1,
    "Hit me.": 1,
    " Okay.": 1,
    "So, I mean, this is the kind of status quo interface, right?": 1,
    "It's very flat, kind of rigid.": 1,
    "And, okay, so you could sex it up and, like, go to a much more lickable Mac, you know.": 1,
    "But really, it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last, you know, 30 years.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " I mean, I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers.": 1,
    "I mean, it's point and click.": 1,
    "It's like the menus, icons.": 1,
    "It's all the kind of same thing.": 1,
    "And so one kind of information space that I kind of take inspiration from is my real desk.": 1,
    " It's so much more subtle, so much more kind of visceral, you know, what's visible, what's not.": 1,
    "And I like to kind of bring that experience to the desktop, so I kind of have a... This is bump top.": 1,
    " It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing.": 1,
    "So you can bump things.": 1,
    "They're all kind of physically, you know, manipulable and stuff.": 1,
    " And instead of that point and click, it's like a push and pull.": 1,
    "Things collide as you'd expect them.": 1,
    "Just like on my real desk, I can turn things into piles instead of just the folders that we have.": 1,
    " And once things are in a pile, I can browse them by throwing them into a grid or flip through them like a book.": 1,
    " Or I can lay them out like a deck of cards.": 1,
    "When they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things.": 1,
    " Or just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right?": 1,
    "And then it's all kind of smoothly animated instead of these sort of jarring changes you see in today's interfaces.": 1,
    " Also, if I want to add something to a pile, how do I do that?": 1,
    "I just toss it to the pile and it's added right to the top.": 1,
    "It's kind of a nice way.": 1,
    " Also, some of the stuff we can do is for these individual icons.": 1,
    "We thought, I mean, how can we kind of play with the idea of icon and push that further?": 1,
    " One of the things I can do is make it bigger if I want to kind of emphasize it and make it more important.": 1,
    "But what's really cool is that since there's a kind of physics simulation running under this, it's actually heavier.": 1,
    "So the lighter stuff doesn't really, you know...": 1,
    " It doesn't really move, but I throw it at the lighter guys.": 1,
    " So it's Cuber's also like a subtle channel of conveying information, right?": 1,
    " heavy, so it feels more important.": 1,
    "So it's kind of cool.": 1,
    "Despite computers everywhere, paper really hasn't disappeared because it has a lot of, I think, valuable properties.": 1,
    "And some of those we wanted to kind of transfer to the icons in our system.": 1,
    " And so one of the things you can do to our icons, just like paper, is crease them and fold them, just like paper, remember, you know, something for later.": 1,
    "Or if you want to be destructive, you can just crumple it up and, you know, toss it to the corner.": 1,
    " Also, just like paper around our workspace, we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later.": 1,
    "And I can do the same thing here.": 1,
    "And you'll see posts and things like that around people's offices.": 1,
    "And I can pull them off when I want to work with them.": 1,
    " So one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that, you know, okay, well, my real desk is really messy.": 1,
    "I don't want that mess on my computer.": 1,
    "So one thing we have for that is kind of like a grid-aligned kind of": 1,
    " So you get that more traditional desktop, things are kind of grid-aligned, more boring, but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping and you can still do fun things like make shells on your desktop.": 1,
    " Let's just break the shelf.": 1,
    "Okay, that shelf broke.": 1,
    " I think beyond the icons, I think another really cool domain for this software, I think it applies to more than just icons in your desktop, but browsing photographs.": 1,
    "I think it could really enrich": 1,
    " the way we kind of browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoe box of photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing.": 1,
    "I can toss these things around.": 1,
    "They're so much more tangible and touchable and I can double click on something to take a look at it.": 1,
    " And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before.": 1,
    "So I can pile things up.": 1,
    "I can flip through it.": 1,
    "I can, you know, OK, let's move this photo to the back.": 1,
    "Let's delete this guy here.": 1,
    "And I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information.": 1,
    " And that's Bumptop.": 1,
    "Thanks.": 1
