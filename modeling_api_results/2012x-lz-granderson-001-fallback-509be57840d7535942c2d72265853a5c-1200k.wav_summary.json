    " When I was about 16 years old, I can remember flipping through channels at home during summer vacation looking for a movie to watch on HBO.": 1,
    " And how many of you remember Ferris Bueller's Day Off?": 1,
    "Oh yeah, great movie, right?": 1,
    "Well, I saw Matthew Broderick on the screen, and so I thought, sweet, Ferris Bueller, I'll watch this.": 1,
    " wasn't Ferris Bueller.": 1,
    "And forgive me Matthew Broderick, I know you've done other movies besides Ferris Bueller, but that's how I remember you, you're Ferris.": 1,
    "But you weren't doing Ferris-y things at the time, you were doing gay things at the time.": 1,
    " He was in a movie called Torch Song Trilogy.": 1,
    "And Torch Song Trilogy was based on a play about this drag queen who essentially was looking for love.": 1,
    "Love and respect.": 1,
    "That's what the whole film was about.": 1,
    " And as I'm watching, I'm realizing that they're talking about me.": 1,
    "Not the drag queen part.": 1,
    "I'm not shaving my hair for anyone.": 1,
    "But the gay part.": 1,
    "The finding love and respect.": 1,
    "The part about trying to find your place in the world.": 1,
    " So as I'm watching this, I see this powerful scene that brought me to tears and it stuck with me for the past 25 years.": 1,
    "And it's this quote that the main character, Arnold, tells his mother.": 1,
    " as they're fighting about who he is and the life that he lives.": 1,
    " There's one thing more, there's just one more thing you better understand.": 1,
    "I've taught myself to sew, cook, fix plumbing, build furniture.": 1,
    "I can even pat myself in the back when necessary.": 1,
    " Also, I don't have to ask anyone for anything.": 1,
    "There's nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect.": 1,
    "Anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life.": 1,
    " I remember that scene like he was yesterday.": 1,
    "I was 16, I was in tears, I was in the closet, and I'm looking at these two people, Ferris Bueller and some guy I've never seen before, fighting for love.": 1,
    " When I finally got to a place in my life where I came out and accepted who I was and was really quite happy to tell you the truth, I was happily gay and I guess that's supposed to be right because gay means happy too.": 1,
    " I realized that a lot of people weren't as gay as I was.": 1,
    "Gay being happy, not gay being attracted to the same sex.": 1,
    " In fact, I heard that there was a lot of hate and a lot of anger and a lot of frustration and a lot of fear about who I was and the gay lifestyle.": 1,
    " Now, I'm sitting here trying to figure out the gay lifestyle, the gay lifestyle.": 1,
    "And I keep hearing this word over and over and over again, lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle.": 1,
    "I've even heard politicians say that the gay lifestyle is a greater threat to civilization than terrorism.": 1,
    " That's when I got scared.": 1,
    " Because I'm thinking, if I'm gay and I'm doing something that's going to destroy civilization, I need to figure out what this stuff is and I need to stop doing it right now.": 1,
    " So I took a look at my life, a hard look at my life, and I saw some things very disturbing.": 1,
    " And I want to begin sharing these evil things that I've been doing with you, starting with my mornings.": 1,
    " I drink coffee.": 1,
    " Not only do I drink coffee, I know other gay people who drink coffee.": 1,
    " I get stuck in traffic.": 1,
    " Evil, evil traffic.": 1,
    "Sometimes I get stuck in lines at airports.": 1,
    " I look around and I go, my God, look at all these gay people.": 1,
    "We're all trapped in these lines, these long lines trying to get on an airplane.": 1,
    "My God, this lifestyle that I'm living is so freaking evil.": 1,
    " I clean up.": 1,
    " This is not an actual photograph of my son's room.": 1,
    "Here's his mess here.": 1,
    " And because I have a 15-year-old, all I do is cook and cook and cook.": 1,
    "Any parents out there of teenagers?": 1,
    "All we do is cook for these people.": 1,
    "They eat two, three, four dinners a night.": 1,
    "It's ridiculous.": 1,
    " This is the gay lifestyle.": 1,
    " And after I'm done cooking and cleaning and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic.": 1,
    " My partner and I, we get together.": 1,
    " and we decide that we're gonna go and have some wild and crazy fun.": 1,
    " We're usually in bed before we find out who's eliminated on American Idol.": 1,
    " We have to wake up and find out the next day who's still on because we're too freaking tired.": 1,
    " to hear who stays on.": 1,
    "This is the super duper evil gay lifestyle.": 1,
    "Run for your heterosexual lives, people.": 1,
    " When my partner Steve and I first started dating, he told me the story about penguins.": 1,
    " And I didn't know where he was going with it at first.": 1,
    "He was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me.": 1,
    "But he told me that when a penguin finds a mate that they want to spend the rest of their life with, they present them with a pebble, the perfect pebble.": 1,
    " And then he reaches into his pocket and he brings this out to me.": 1,
    " And I looked at it and I was like, this is really cool.": 1,
    "And he says, I want to spend the rest of my life with you.": 1,
    " So I wear this whenever I have to do something that makes me a little nervous, like, I don't know, a TEDx talk.": 1,
    "I wear this when I am apart from him for a long period of time.": 1,
    "And sometimes I just wear it just because.": 1,
    " How many people out there are in love?": 1,
    "Anyone in love out there?": 1,
    " You might be gay.": 1,
    " because I too am in love and apparently that's part of the gay lifestyle that I warned you about.": 1,
    " You may want to tell your spouse.": 1,
    " who, if they're in love, might be Gizwell.": 1,
    "How many of you are single?": 1,
    " Any single people out there, you too might be gay.": 1,
    "Because I know some gay people who are also single.": 1,
    " It's really scary, this gay lifestyle thing.": 1,
    "It's super duper evil and there's no end to it.": 1,
    "It goes and goes and engulfs.": 1,
    " It's really quite silly, isn't it?": 1,
    " That's why I'm so happy to finally hear President Obama come out and say,": 1,
    " that he supports": 1,
    " that he supports marriage equality.": 1,
    " It's a wonderful day in our country's history.": 1,
    "It's a wonderful day in the globe's history to be able to have an actual sitting president say enough of this, first to himself and then to the rest of the world.": 1,
    "It's wonderful.": 1,
    " But there's something that's been disturbing me since he made that remark just a short time ago.": 1,
    "And that is apparently this is just another move by": 1,
    " the gay activists that's on the gay agenda.": 1,
    " And I'm disturbed by this because I've been openly gay now for quite some time.": 1,
    "I've been to all of the functions, I've been to fundraisers, I've written about the topic, and I have yet to receive my copy of this gay agenda.": 1,
    " I paid my dues on time.": 1,
    " I've marched in gay pride flags, parades in the whole nine, and I have yet to see a copy of the gay agenda.": 1,
    "It was very, very frustrating.": 1,
    "I was feeling left out, like I wasn't quite gay enough.": 1,
    " But then something wonderful happened.": 1,
    "I was out shopping, as I tend to do, and I came across a bootleg copy of the official gay agenda.": 1,
    " And I said to myself, Elsie, for so long you have been denied this.": 1,
    "When you get in front of this crowd, you're going to share the news.": 1,
    "You're going to spread the gay agenda so no one else has to wonder": 1,
    " What exactly is in the gay agenda?": 1,
    "What are these gays up to?": 1,
    " What do they want?": 1,
    "So without further ado, I will present to you, ladies and gentlemen, and be careful because it's evil.": 1,
    " a copy, the official copy of the gay agenda.": 1,
    " The End": 1,
    " The end": 1,
    " Agenda people": 1,
    " There it is.": 1,
    " They just soak it all in the gay agenda.": 1,
    "Some of you may be calling it the Constitution of the United States.": 1,
    "Is that what you call it, too?": 1,
    " The U.S.": 1,
    "Constitution is the gay agenda.": 1,
    "These gays, people like me, want to be treated like full citizens.": 1,
    "And it's all written down in plain sight.": 1,
    " I was blown away when I saw it.": 1,
    "I was like, wait, this is the gay agenda?": 1,
    "Why didn't you just call it the Constitution so I knew what you were talking about?": 1,
    " I wouldn't have been so confused.": 1,
    "I wouldn't have been so upset.": 1,
    " But there it is, the gay agenda.": 1,
    "Run for your heterosexual lives.": 1,
    " Did you know that in all the states where there is no shading that": 1,
    " People who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender can be kicked out of their apartments for being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.": 1,
    " That's the only reason that a landlord needs to have them removed because there is no protection from discrimination of GLBT people.": 1,
    " Did you know in the states where there's no shading that you can be fired for being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered?": 1,
    " not based upon the quality of your work.": 1,
    " How long you've been there, if you stink.": 1,
    " just if you're gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.": 1,
    " All of which flies in the face of the gay agenda, also known as the US Constitution.": 1,
    "Specifically, this little amendment right here.": 1,
    " No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.": 1,
    " I'm looking at you, North Carolina.": 1,
    " But you're not looking at the U.S.": 1,
    "Constitution.": 1,
    " This is the gay agenda, equality, not special rights, but the rights that are already written by these people, these elitists, if you will.": 1,
    " educated, well dressed.": 1,
    " Some would dare say questionably dressed.": 1,
    " Nonetheless, our forefathers, right, the people that we say knew what they were doing when they wrote the Constitution, the gay agenda, if you will.": 1,
    " All that flies in the face of what they did.": 1,
    " That is the reason why I felt it was imperative that I presented you with this copy of The Gay Agenda.": 1,
    " because I figured if I made it funny you wouldn't be as threatened.": 1,
    "I figured if I was a bit irreverent you wouldn't find it serious.": 1,
    "But when you see the map": 1,
    " and you see our state of Michigan.": 1,
    " It's legal.": 1,
    " to fire someone for being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered.": 1,
    "That is legal to remove someone from their home because they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered.": 1,
    " Then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality, it's not about stripping someone's rights away.": 1,
    "It's about granting them the rights that have already been stated.": 1,
    " And we're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated, that we've already agreed upon.": 1,
    " There are people living in fear.": 1,
    " of losing their jobs.": 1,
    " so they don't show anyone who they really are.": 1,
    " right here at home.": 1,
    "This isn't just about North Carolina.": 1,
    "All of those states that were clear, it's legal.": 1,
    " If I could brag for a second.": 1,
    " I have a 15 year old son.": 1,
    " from my marriage.": 1,
    " He has a 4.0.": 1,
    " He is starting a new club at school, policy debate.": 1,
    " He's a budding track star.": 1,
    " He has almost every single record in middle school for every event that he competed in.": 1,
    " He volunteers.": 1,
    " He prays before he eats.": 1,
    " I would like to think as his father, and he lives with me primarily,": 1,
    " that I had a little something to do with all of that.": 1,
    " I would like to think that he's a good boy, a respectful young man.": 1,
    " all right to think that I've proven to be a capable father.": 1,
    " But if I were to go to the state of Michigan today,": 1,
    " and try to adopt a young person who is in an orphanage, I will be disqualified for only one reason.": 1,
    " because I'm gay.": 1,
    " Doesn't matter what I've already proven, what I can do with my heart.": 1,
    " It's because of what the state of Michigan says that I am, that I am disqualified for any sort of adoption.": 1,
    " And that's not just about me.": 1,
    " That's about so many other Michiganders, US citizens who don't understand why what they are is so much more significant than who they are.": 1,
    " This story just keeps playing over and over and over again in our country's history.": 1,
    " There was a time in which, I don't know, people who were black couldn't have the same rights.": 1,
    "People who happened to be women didn't have the same rights, couldn't vote.": 1,
    " There was a point in our history in which if you were considered disabled, that an employer could just fire you before the Americans with Disabilities Act.": 1,
    " We keep doing this over and over again.": 1,
    "And so here we are.": 1,
    " 2012.": 1,
    " Gay agenda, gay lifestyle, and I'm not a good dad, and people don't deserve to be able to protect their families because of what they are, not who they are.": 1,
    " So when you hear the words gay lifestyle and gay agenda in the future, I encourage you to do two things.": 1,
    "One.": 1,
    " Remember the US Constitution.": 1,
    " And then two, if you wouldn't mind looking to your left, please.": 1,
    " Look to your right.": 1,
    " That person next to you is a brother, is a sister, and they should be treated with love and respect.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
