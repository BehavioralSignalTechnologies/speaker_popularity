    " So my name is Kate Hartman.": 1,
    " And I like to make devices that play with the ways that we relate and communicate.": 1,
    "So I'm specifically interested in how we as humans relate to ourselves, each other, and the world around us.": 1,
    " So just to give you a bit of context, as June said, I'm an artist, a technologist, and an educator.": 1,
    "I teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics.": 1,
    "And much of what I do is either wearable or somehow relates to the human form.": 1,
    " And so anytime I talk about what I do, I like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter.": 1,
    "And it's pretty simple.": 1,
    " Everybody's got one.": 1,
    "All of you.": 1,
    "I can guarantee everyone in this room, all of you over there, the people in the cushy seats, the people up top with the laptops, we all have bodies.": 1,
    " Don't be ashamed.": 1,
    "And it's something that we have in common, and they act as our sort of primary interfaces for the world.": 1,
    "And so when working as an interaction designer or as an artist who deals with participation,": 1,
    " Creating things that live on in or around the human form, it's really a powerful space to work within.": 1,
    " So within my own work, I use a broad range of materials and tools.": 1,
    "So I communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing.": 1,
    "And to tell you a bit about the things that I make, the easiest place to start the story is with...": 1,
    " A hat.": 1,
    "And so it all started several years ago late one night when I was sitting on the subway riding home, and I was thinking.": 1,
    "And I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too much.": 1,
    " too little, and so I was thinking about how it might be great if I could just take all these noises, like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head, if I could just sort of physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that I could share them with somebody else.": 1,
    " And so I went home and I made a prototype of this hat.": 1,
    "And I called it the muttering hat because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you, but you could detach them and share them with somebody else.": 1,
    " So I make other hats as well.": 1,
    "This one is called the talk to yourself hat.": 1,
    " Fairly self-explanatory, it physically carves out conversation space for one, and when you speak out loud, the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears.": 1,
    " And so when I make these things, it's really not so much about the object itself, but rather the negative space around the object.": 1,
    " So what happens when a person puts this thing on?": 1,
    "What kind of experience do they have?": 1,
    "And how are they kind of transformed by wearing it?": 1,
    " So many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves.": 1,
    "So this particular device is called the Gut Listener.": 1,
    "And it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards.": 1,
    " And so some of these things are actually more geared towards expression and communication.": 1,
    "And so the inflatable heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves.": 1,
    " inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions so they can express everything from admiration and lust to anxiety and angst.": 1,
    " And some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences.": 1,
    "So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments.": 1,
    " And so it actually allows for an intense emotional exchange but it serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered.": 1,
    " And in the end, some of these things just act as invitations.": 1,
    "So the ear bender literally puts something out there so that someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say.": 1,
    " So even though I'm really interested in the relationship between people, I also consider the ways in which we relate to the world around us.": 1,
    "And so when I was first living in New York City a few years back, I was thinking a lot about": 1,
    " you know, the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how I would like to better relate to them.": 1,
    "And I thought, well, hey, you know, maybe if I want to better relate to walls, maybe I need to be more wall-like myself.": 1,
    "So I made a wearable wall.": 1,
    " that I could wear as a backpack.": 1,
    "So I would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that I could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me.": 1,
    " And so sort of jumping off of that, you know, thinking beyond the built environment and into the natural world, I have this ongoing project called Botana Calls, which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols.": 1,
    " So when a plant is thirsty, it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like Twitter.": 1,
    "And so this really shifts the human plant's dynamic because...": 1,
    " A single houseplant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time.": 1,
    " And so thinking about scale, my most recent obsession is actually with glaciers, of course.": 1,
    " And so glaciers are these magnificent beings, and there's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them.": 1,
    "But what I'm particularly interested in is in human glacier relations.": 1,
    " Because there seems to be an issue.": 1,
    "The glaciers are actually leaving us.": 1,
    "They're both shrinking and retreating, and some of them have disappeared altogether.": 1,
    " And so I actually live in Canada now, so I've been visiting one of my local glaciers.": 1,
    "And this one's particularly interesting because of all the glaciers in North America, it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year.": 1,
    " They actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral marine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier.": 1,
    "And this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter.": 1,
    "When I made a glacier for the very first time,": 1,
    " What do I do?": 1,
    "There's no kind of social protocol for this.": 1,
    "I really just don't even know how to say hello.": 1,
    " Do I carve a message in the snow or perhaps I can assemble one out of dot and dash ice cubes?": 1,
    " Or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool, you know, like an icy megaphone that I can use to amplify my voice when I direct it at the ice.": 1,
    " But really the most satisfying experience I've had is the act of listening, which is what we need in any good relationship.": 1,
    "And I was really struck by how much it affected me to just this very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier.": 1,
    " And so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days, I actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit.": 1,
    " And so this is constructed out of a heat-reflective material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice.": 1,
    "And once again, it's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and...": 1,
    " give it a hug.": 1,
    "So, yeah, so this is actually just the beginning.": 1,
    "These are initial musings for this project.": 1,
    "And just as with the wall, how I wanted to be more wall-like, with this project, I'd actually like to take more of a glacial pace.": 1,
    " And so my intent is to actually just take the next ten years and go on a series of collaborative projects where I work with people from different disciplines, artists, technologists, scientists,": 1,
    " to work on this project of how we can improve human-glacial relations.": 1,
    " So beyond that, in closing, I'd just like to say that we're in this era of communications and device proliferation, and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy.": 1,
    " But I think what's really important is thinking about how we can kind of simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world.": 1,
    "Thanks.": 1
