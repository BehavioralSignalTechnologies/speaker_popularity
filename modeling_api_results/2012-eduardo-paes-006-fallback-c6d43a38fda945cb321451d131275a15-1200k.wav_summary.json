    " It's a great honor to be here.": 1,
    "It's a great honor to be here talking about cities, talking about the future of cities.": 1,
    "It's great to be here as a mayor.": 1,
    "I really do believe that mayors": 1,
    " I have the political position to really change people's lives.": 1,
    "That's the place to be.": 1,
    "And it's great to be here as the mayor of Rio.": 1,
    " beautiful city, a vibrant place, special place.": 1,
    "Actually, you look into a guy that has the best job in the world and I really wanted to share you a very special moment of my life and the history of the city of Rio.": 1,
    " And now ladies and gentlemen, the envelope contains the result.": 1,
    "I have the honor to announce that the games of the 31st Olympiad are awarded to the city of": 1,
    " Rio de Janeiro!": 1,
    " Okay, that's very touching, very emotional, but it was not easy to get there.": 1,
    "Actually it was a very hard challenge.": 1,
    "We had to beat the European monarchy.": 1,
    "This is Rey Juan Carlos, King of Spain.": 1,
    " We had to beat the powerful Japanese with all their technology.": 1,
    "We had to beat the most powerful man in the world, defending his own city, so it was not easy at all.": 1,
    " This last guy here said a phrase a few years ago that I think fits perfectly to the situation of winning the Olympic bid.": 1,
    "I mean, we really showed that yes, we can.": 1,
    " And really, this is the reason I came here tonight.": 1,
    "I came here tonight to tell you that things can be done, that you don't have always to be rich or powerful to get things on the way.": 1,
    " that cities are a great challenge, it's a difficult task to deal with cities, but with some original ways of getting things done, with some basic commandments,": 1,
    " you can really get cities to be a great, great place to live.": 1,
    " I want you all to imagine Rio.": 1,
    "I mean, you probably will think about a city full of energy, a vibrant city full of green, and nobody showed that better than Carlos Saldana in last year's Rio.": 1,
    " Wow!": 1,
    "This is incredible!": 1,
    " Oh": 1,
    " Okay, some parts of Rio are pretty much like that, but it's not like that everywhere.": 1,
    "We like every big city in the world.": 1,
    "We got lots of people.": 1,
    " pollution, cars, concrete, lots of concrete.": 1,
    "These pictures I'm showing here, they are some pictures from Madureira.": 1,
    "It's like the heart of the suburb in Rio.": 1,
    " And I want to use an example of Rio that we're doing in Madureira in this region to see what we should think is our first commandment.": 1,
    "So every time you see a concrete jungle like that, what you've got to do is": 1,
    " find open spaces.": 1,
    "If you don't have open spaces, you've got to go there, open spaces.": 1,
    "So go inside this open spaces and make that people can get inside, can use that spaces.": 1,
    " This is going to be the third largest park in Rio, in June this year.": 1,
    "It's going to be a place where people can meet, where you can put nature.": 1,
    "The temperature is going to drop two, three degrees centigrade.": 1,
    " The first commandment I want to leave here tonight is the city of the future has to be environmentally friendly.": 1,
    "Every time you think of a city, you've got to think green, you've got to think green and green.": 1,
    " So moving to our second commandment that I wanted to show you.": 1,
    "Let's think that cities are made of people.": 1,
    "I mean lots of people together.": 1,
    "Cities are packed with people.": 1,
    "So how do you move these people around when you have 3.5 billion people?": 1,
    " Living in cities by 2050 is going to be 60 million people So every time you think about moving these people around you think about high-capacity transportation, but": 1,
    " there is a problem.": 1,
    "High capacity transportation means spending lots and lots of money.": 1,
    " So what I'm going to show here is something that was already presented in TED by the former mayor of Curitiba.": 1,
    "He created that, a city in Brazil, Jaime Lerner, and it's something that we're doing again lots in Rio.": 1,
    " It's the BRT, the Bus Rapid Transit.": 1,
    "So you get a bus.": 1,
    "It's a simple bus that everybody knows.": 1,
    "You transform it inside as a train car.": 1,
    " You separate lanes, dedicated lanes.": 1,
    "The contractors, they don't like that.": 1,
    "You don't have to dig deep down on the ground.": 1,
    " You can build nice stations.": 1,
    "This is actually a station that we do in Rio.": 1,
    "Again, you don't have to dig deep down on the ground to make a station like that.": 1,
    "The stations have the same comfort, the same features.": 1,
    " As a subway station, the kilometer of this costs a tenth of a subway.": 1,
    "So spending much less money and doing it much faster, you can really change the way people move.": 1,
    "This is a map of Rio.": 1,
    " All the lines, the color lines you see there, it's our high capacity transportation network.": 1,
    "In this present time today we only carry 18% of our population in high capacity transportation.": 1,
    " With the BRTs we're doing, again, cheapest and fastest way, we're going to move to 63% of the population being carried by high capacity transportation.": 1,
    "So remember what I said.": 1,
    " You don't always have to be rich or powerful to get things done.": 1,
    "You can find original ways to get things done.": 1,
    "So the second commandment I want to leave here tonight is a city of the future has to deal with mobility and integration.": 1,
    " of its people.": 1,
    " Moving to the third commandment, and this is the most controversial one.": 1,
    "It has to do with the favelas, the slums, whatever you call it.": 1,
    "There are different names.": 1,
    " all over the world.": 1,
    "But the point we want to make here tonight is favelas are not always a problem.": 1,
    "I mean favelas can sometimes really be": 1,
    " a solution if you deal with them, if you put public policy inside the favelas.": 1,
    "Let me just show a map of Rio again.": 1,
    "Rio has 6.3 million inhabitants.": 1,
    " More than 20%, 1.4 million live in the favelas.": 1,
    "All these red spots are favelas.": 1,
    "So you see they are spread all over the city.": 1,
    "This is a typical view of a favela in Rio.": 1,
    "I mean, you see the contrast between the rich and poor.": 1,
    " So I want to make two points here tonight about favelas.": 1,
    "The first one is you can change from what I call a visual circle to a virtual circle.": 1,
    "But what you got to do to get that?": 1,
    " You've got to go inside the favelas, bring in the basic services, mainly education and health, with high quality.": 1,
    "I'm going to give a fast example here.": 1,
    "This was an old building in a favela in Rio, Colonia Juliano Moreira.": 1,
    " that we just transformed into a primary school.": 1,
    "I mean, with high quality.": 1,
    "This is a primary assistant in health that we built inside of Favela.": 1,
    "Again, with high quality.": 1,
    "We call it a family clinic.": 1,
    "So the first point is that": 1,
    " Bring basic services inside the favelas with high quality.": 1,
    "The second point I want to make about the favelas is you got to open spaces in the favela.": 1,
    "Bring infrastructure to the favelas, to the slums, wherever you are.": 1,
    " I mean Rio has the aim by 2020 to have all its favelas completely urbanized.": 1,
    "Another example, this was completely packed with house and then we built this what we call a knowledge square.": 1,
    "This is a place with high technology.": 1,
    " where the kids that live in a poor house next to this place can go inside and have access to all technology.": 1,
    "We even built a theater there, 3D movie.": 1,
    " And this is the kind of change you can get for that.": 1,
    "So then by the end of the day, you get something better than a tad prize, which is this great laugh from a kid that lived in the favela.": 1,
    " So the third commandment I want to live here tonight is a city of the future has to be socially integrated.": 1,
    "You cannot deal with a city if it's not socially integrated.": 1,
    "But moving to our fourth commandment.": 1,
    " I really wouldn't be here tonight.": 1,
    "I mean, between November and May, it was completely packed.": 1,
    "We just had last week's carnival.": 1,
    "It was great.": 1,
    "It was lots of fun.": 1,
    " We have New Year's Eve.": 1,
    "It's like two million people in Copacabana Beach.": 1,
    "We have problems.": 1,
    "I mean, we find floods, tropical rains at this time of the year.": 1,
    "You can imagine how people get happy with me watching these kind of scenes.": 1,
    " We have problems with the tropical rains.": 1,
    "Almost every year we have these landslides, which are terrible.": 1,
    " But the reason I could come here is because of that.": 1,
    "This was something that we did with IBM that's a little bit more than a year old.": 1,
    "It's what we call the Operation Center of Rio.": 1,
    " And I wanted to show that I can govern my city using technology from here, from Long Beach.": 1,
    "So I got here last night and I know everything.": 1,
    "We're going to speak now to the operations center.": 1,
    "This is Osorio.": 1,
    "He's our secretary of urban affairs.": 1,
    " So Azario, good to be there with you.": 1,
    "I've already told the people that we have tropical rain this time of the year, so how's the weather in Rio now?": 1,
    " Weather is fine.": 1,
    "We had a fair weather today.": 1,
    "Let me get you our weather satellite radar.": 1,
    "You see just a little bit of moisture around the city.": 1,
    "Absolutely no problem in the city in terms of weather today and in the next few days.": 1,
    " Okay, how's the traffic?": 1,
    "I mean, we this time of year get lots of traffic jam.": 1,
    "People get mad at the mayor, so how's the traffic tonight?": 1,
    " Well, traffic tonight is fine.": 1,
    "Let me get you one of our buses, one of our 8,000 buses, a live transmission in downtown Rio for you, Mr. Mayor.": 1,
    "You see the streets are clear.": 1,
    "Now it's 11 p.m.": 1,
    "in Rio.": 1,
    " nothing of concern in terms of traffic.": 1,
    "I'll get to you now the incidents of the day.": 1,
    "We had heavy traffic early in the morning and in the rush hour in the afternoon, but nothing of big concern.": 1,
    "We are the low average in terms of": 1,
    " traffic incidents in the city okay so you're showing out some public services these are the cars": 1,
    " Absolutely, Mr. Mayor.": 1,
    "Let me get you the fleet of our waste collection trucks.": 1,
    "This is live transmission.": 1,
    "We have DPSs in all of our trucks.": 1,
    " and you can see them working in all parts of the CT Waves Correction on time.": 1,
    "Public service is working well.": 1,
    "OK, Ozadio, thank you very much.": 1,
    "It was great to have you here.": 1,
    "We're going to move so that I can make a conclusion.": 1,
    " Okay, so.": 1,
    " No files displaced, no paperwork, no distance, 24-7 working.": 1,
    "So the fourth commandment I want to share you here tonight is...": 1,
    " The city of the future has to use technology to be present.": 1,
    "I don't need to be there anymore to know and to administrate the city.": 1,
    "But everything that I said here tonight, the commandments, are means, are ways for us": 1,
    " to govern cities.": 1,
    "I mean, invest in infrastructure, invest in the green, open parks, open spaces, integrate socially, use technology.": 1,
    "But by the end of the day, when we talk about cities, we talk about gathering of people.": 1,
    " And we cannot see that as a problem.": 1,
    "That is fantastic.": 1,
    "If there's 3.5 billion now, it's going to be 6 billion, then it's going to be 10 billion.": 1,
    " That is great.": 1,
    "That means that we're going to have 10 billion minds working together, 10 billion talents together, so a city of the future.": 1,
    " I really do believe that it's a city that cares about its citizens, integrates socially its citizens.": 1,
    "A city of the future is a city that can never let anyone out of this great party which are cities.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
