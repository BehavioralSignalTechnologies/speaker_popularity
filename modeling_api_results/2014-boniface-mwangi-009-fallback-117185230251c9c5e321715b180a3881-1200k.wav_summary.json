    "Thank you.": 2,
    " People back home call me a heckler, a troublemaker, an irritant, a rebel, an activist, the voice of the people.": 1,
    "But that wasn't always me.": 1,
    " Growing up with a nickname, they used to call me Softee.": 1,
    " meaning the soft, harmless boy, like every other human being, I avoided trouble.": 1,
    "In my childhood, they taught me silence.": 1,
    "Don't argue, do as they told.": 1,
    "In Sunday school, they taught me don't confront, don't argue, even if you're right,": 1,
    " than the other cheek.": 1,
    "This was reinforced by the political climate of the time.": 1,
    " Kenya is a country where you are guilty until proven rich.": 1,
    " Kenya's poor are five times more likely to be shot dead by the police who are meant to protect them than by criminals.": 1,
    "This was reinforced by the political climate of the day.": 1,
    "We had President Moi, who was a dictator.": 1,
    " He ruled the country with an iron fist, and anyone who dared question his authority was arrested, tortured, jailed, or even killed.": 1,
    " That meant that people are told to be smart cowards instead of trouble.": 1,
    "Being a coward was not an insult.": 1,
    "Being a coward was a compliment.": 1,
    "We used to be told that a coward goes home to his mother.": 1,
    "Well, that meant that if you stay out of trouble, you're going to stay alive.": 1,
    " I used to question this advice, and eight years ago we had an election in Kenya, and the results were violently disputed.": 1,
    "What followed that election was tribal violence, rape, and the killing of over 1,000 people.": 1,
    " My work was to document the violence.": 1,
    "As a photographer, I took thousands of images": 1,
    " And after two months, the two politicians came together, had a cup of tea.": 1,
    " sign a peace agreement and the country moved on.": 1,
    " I was a very disturbed man because I saw the violence firsthand.": 1,
    "I saw the killings.": 1,
    "I saw the displacement.": 1,
    "I met women who had been raped, and it disturbed me.": 1,
    " But the country never spoke about it.": 1,
    "We pretended.": 1,
    "We all became smart cowards.": 1,
    "We decided to stay out of trouble and not talk about it.": 1,
    " Ten months later, I quit my job.": 1,
    "I said I could not stand it anymore.": 1,
    "After quitting my job, I decided to organize my friends to speak about the violence in the country, speak about the state of the nation.": 1,
    " And first June 2009 was the day that we were meant to go to the stadium and try and get the president's attention.": 1,
    "It's a national holiday.": 1,
    "It's broadcast across the country.": 1,
    "And I showed up at the stadium.": 1,
    " My friends didn't show up.": 1,
    "I found myself alone.": 1,
    " And I didn't know what to do.": 1,
    "I was scared.": 1,
    "But I knew very well that that particular day I had to make a decision.": 1,
    "Was I going to live as a coward like everyone else?": 1,
    "Was I going to make a stand?": 1,
    " And when the president stood up to speak, I found myself on my feet, shouting at the president, telling him to remember the post-election violence victims, to stop the corruption.": 1,
    " And suddenly, out of nowhere, the police pounced on me like hungry lions.": 1,
    "They held my mouth and dragged me to the stadium where they thoroughly beat me up and locked me up in jail.": 1,
    " I spent that night in a cold.": 1,
    " cement floor in the jail.": 1,
    " and that got me thinking.": 1,
    " What was making me feel this way?": 1,
    "My friends and family thought I was crazy because of what I did.": 1,
    "And the images that I took were disturbing my life.": 1,
    " The images that I took was just a number to many Kenyans.": 1,
    "Most Kenyans did not see the violence.": 1,
    "It was a story to them.": 1,
    " And so I decided to actually start a street exhibition to show the images of the violence across the country and get people talking about it.": 1,
    "We travel the country and show the images.": 1,
    "And this was a journey that started me to the activist path.": 1,
    " where it's said to become silent no more.": 1,
    "Let's talk about those things.": 1,
    " We traveled, and a journey that started from a street exhibit became": 1,
    " say doing political graffiti, about the situation in the country, talking about corruption, about leadership.": 1,
    " We have even done symbolic burials.": 1,
    " We have delivered live pigs to Kenya's parliament as a symbol of our politicians' greed.": 1,
    "It has been done in Uganda and other countries.": 1,
    "And what is most powerful is that the message has been picked by the media and amplified across the country, across the continent.": 1,
    " where I used to stand up alone seven years ago.": 1,
    "Now I belong to a community of many people who stand up with me.": 1,
    "I am no longer alone when I stand up to speak about these things.": 1,
    " I belong to a group of young people who are passionate about the country, want to bring about change, and they're no longer afraid, and they're no longer smart cowards.": 1,
    " So that was my story.": 1,
    " that in the stadium.": 1,
    " I stood up as a smart coward.": 1,
    "By that one action, I said goodbye to 24 years living as a coward.": 1,
    "There are two most powerful days in your life.": 1,
    "The day you're born.": 1,
    " and the day we discover why.": 1,
    "That day standing up in that stadium, shooting at the president, I discovered why I was truly born.": 1,
    "That I will no longer be silent in the face of injustice.": 1,
    " Do you know why you were born?": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " It's an amazing story.": 1,
    "I just want to ask you a couple quick questions.": 1,
    "So, Powah254, you've created a studio, a place where": 1,
    " young people can go and harness the power of digital media to do some of this action.": 1,
    "What's happening now with power?": 1,
    " So we have this community of filmmakers, graffiti artists, musicians.": 1,
    "When there's an issue in the country, we come together, we brainstorm, and take up on that issue.": 1,
    "So our most powerful tool is art.": 1,
    " because we live in a very busy world where people are so busy with their life and they don't have time to read.": 1,
    "So we package our activism and we package our message in art.": 1,
    "So from the music, the graffiti, the art, that's what you do.": 1,
    " Can I say one more thing?": 1,
    "Yeah, of course.": 1,
    " In spite of being arrested, beaten up, threatened, the moment I discovered my voice, that I could actually stand up for what I really believe in, I'm no longer afraid.": 1,
    "I always used to be called softy, but I'm no longer softy because I discovered who I really am, as in that's what I want to do.": 1,
    " And there's such beauty in doing that.": 1,
    "There's nothing as powerful as that, knowing that I'm meant to do this.": 1,
    "Because you don't get scared, you just continue living your life.": 1
