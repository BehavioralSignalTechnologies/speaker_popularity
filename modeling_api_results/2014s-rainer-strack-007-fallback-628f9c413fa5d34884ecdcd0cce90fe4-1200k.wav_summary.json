    " 2014 is a very special year for me.": 1,
    "20 years as a consultant, 20 years of marriage, and I'm turning 50 in one month.": 1,
    " That means I was born in 1964 in a small town in Germany.": 1,
    "It was a grey November day and I was over two.": 1,
    " The hospital's maternity ward was really stressed out because a lot of babies were born on this gray November day.": 1,
    " As a matter of fact, 1964 was the year with the highest birthrate ever in Germany, more than 1.3 million.": 1,
    "Last year, we just hit over 600,000, so half of my number.": 1,
    " What you can see here is the German age pyramid.": 1,
    "And there, this small black point at the top, that's me.": 1,
    " In red, you can see the potential working age population.": 1,
    "So people over 15 and under 65.": 1,
    "And I'm actually only interested in the straight area.": 1,
    " Now let's do a simple simulation of how this age structure will develop over the next couple of years.": 1,
    "As you can see, the peak is moving to the right.": 1,
    " And I, with many other baby boomers, will retire in 2030.": 1,
    "By the way, I don't need any forecasts of birthrates for predicting this rate area.": 1,
    " The rate area, so the potential working age population in 2030, is already set in stone today, except for much higher migration rates.": 1,
    "And if you compare this rate area in 2030,": 1,
    " With red area in 2014, it is much, much smaller.": 1,
    " So before I show you the rest of the world, what does this mean for Germany?": 1,
    "So what we know from this picture is that labor supply, so people who provide labor, will go down in Germany and will go down significantly.": 1,
    " Now, what about labor demand?": 1,
    "That's where it gets tricky.": 1,
    "As you might know, the consultant's favorite answer to any question is, it depends.": 1,
    " So I would say it depends.": 1,
    "We didn't want to forecast the future.": 1,
    "Highly speculative.": 1,
    "We did something else.": 1,
    " We looked at the GDP and productivity growth of Germany over the last 20 years and calculated the following scenario.": 1,
    " If Germany wants to continue this GDP and productivity growth, we could directly calculate how many people Germany would need to support this growth.": 1,
    "And this is the green line \u2013 labour demand.": 1,
    " So Germany will run into a major talent shortage very quickly.": 1,
    "8 million people are missing, which is more than 20% of our current workforce.": 1,
    "So big numbers.": 1,
    " really big numbers and we calculated several scenarios and the picture always looked like this.": 1,
    " Now, to close the gap, Germany has to significantly increase migration, get many more women in the workforce, increase retirement age.": 1,
    "By the way, we just lowered it this year, and all these measures at once.": 1,
    " If Germany fails here, Germany will stagnate.": 1,
    "We won't grow anymore.": 1,
    "Why?": 1,
    "Because the workers are not there who can generate this growth.": 1,
    "And companies will look for talents somewhere else.": 1,
    " But where?": 1,
    " Now, we simulated labor supply and labor demand for the largest 15 economies in the world, representing more than 70% of world GDP.": 1,
    "And the overall picture looks like this by 2020.": 1,
    " Blue indicates a labor surplus.": 1,
    "Red indicates a labor shortfall.": 1,
    "And gray are those countries which are borderline.": 1,
    " So by 2020, we still see a labor surplus in some countries, like Italy, France, the US.": 1,
    "But this picture will change dramatically by 2030.": 1,
    " By 2030, we will face a global workforce crisis in most of our largest economies.": 1,
    " Including three out of the four big countries China with its former one child policy will be hit as well as Brazil and Russia": 1,
    " Now, to tell the truth,": 1,
    " In reality, the situation will be even more challenging.": 1,
    "What you can see here are average numbers.": 1,
    " We de-averaged them and broke them down to different skill levels.": 1,
    "And what we found were even higher shortfalls for high skilled people and a partial surplus for low skilled workers.": 1,
    " So on top of an overall labor shortage, we will face a big skill mismatch in the future.": 1,
    "And this means huge challenges in terms of education, qualification, upskilling for governments and companies.": 1,
    " Now, the next thing we looked into was robots, automation, technology.": 1,
    "Will technology change this picture and boost productivity?": 1,
    " Now, a short answer would be that our numbers already include a significant growth in productivity driven by technology.": 1,
    " A long answer would go like this.": 1,
    " Let's take Germany again.": 1,
    "The Germans have a certain reputation in the world when it comes to productivity.": 1,
    "In the 90s, I worked in our Boston office for almost two years.": 1,
    " And when I left, an old senior partner told me literally, send me more of these Germans, they work like machines.": 1,
    " That was 1998.": 1,
    "16 years later, he would probably say the opposite.": 1,
    "Send me more of these machines, they work like Germans.": 1,
    " Technology will replace a lot of jobs, regular jobs, not only in the production industry, but even office workers are in jeopardy and might be replaced by robots, artificial intelligence, big data or automation.": 1,
    " So the key question is not if technology replaces some of these jobs, but when, how fast and to what extent.": 1,
    "Or in other words, will technology help us to solve this global workforce crisis?": 1,
    " Yes and no.": 1,
    "This is a more sophisticated version of it depends.": 1,
    "Let's take the automotive industry as an example.": 1,
    " because there more than 40% of industrial robots are already working and automation has already taken place.": 1,
    " In 1980, less than 10% of the production cost of a car was caused by electronic parts.": 1,
    " Today, this number is more than 30% and it will grow to more than 50% by 2030.": 1,
    " And these new electronic parts and applications require new skills and have created a lot of new jobs, like the cognitive systems engineer.": 1,
    " who optimises the interaction between driver and electronic system.": 1,
    " In 1980, no one had the slightest clue that such a job would ever exist.": 1,
    " As a matter of fact, the overall number of people involved in the production of a car has only slouched slightly in the last decades, despite of robots and automation.": 1,
    "So what does this mean?": 1,
    " Yes, technology will replace a lot of jobs.": 1,
    "But we will also see a lot of new jobs and new skills on the horizon.": 1,
    " And that means technology will worsen our overall skill mismatch.": 1,
    "And this kind of de-averaging reveals the crucial challenge for governments and businesses.": 1,
    " So people, high skilled people, talents will be the big thing in the next decade.": 1,
    "If they are the scarce resource, we have to understand them much better.": 1,
    " Are they actually willing to work abroad?": 1,
    "What are their job preferences?": 1,
    " To find out, this year we conducted a global survey among more than 200,000 job seekers from 189 countries.": 1,
    " Migration is certainly one, let's say, key measure to close a gap, at least in the short term.": 1,
    "So we asked about mobility.": 1,
    " More than 60% of these 200,000 shop seekers are willing to work abroad.": 1,
    "For me, a surprisingly high number.": 1,
    "If you look at the employees aged 21 to 30,": 1,
    " this number is even higher.": 1,
    "If you split this number up by country, yes, the world is mobile.": 1,
    " but only partly.": 1,
    "The least mobile countries are Russia, Germany and the US.": 1,
    " Now where do these people like to move to?": 1,
    "Number seven is Australia where 28% could imagine moving to.": 1,
    " Then France, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, UK, and top choice worldwide is the US.": 1,
    "Now, what are the job preferences of these 200,000 people?": 1,
    "So what are they looking for?": 1,
    " Out of a list of 26 topics, celery is only number 8.": 1,
    " The top four topics are all around culture.": 1,
    "Number four, having a great relationship with the boss.": 1,
    "Three, enjoying a great work-life balance.": 1,
    " Two, having a great relationship with colleagues and top priority worldwide is being appreciated for your work.": 1,
    "So do I get a thank you?": 1,
    " not only once a year with the annual bonus payment, but every day.": 1,
    "And now our global workforce crisis becomes very personal.": 1,
    " People are looking for recognition.": 1,
    "Aren't we all looking for recognition in our jobs?": 1,
    " Now, let me connect the dots.": 1,
    "We will face a global workforce crisis, which consists of an overall labour shortage, plus a huge skill mismatch, plus a big cultural challenge.": 1,
    " And this global workforce crisis is approaching very fast.": 1,
    "Right now we are just at the turning point.": 1,
    "So what can we, what can governments, what can companies do?": 1,
    " Every company but also every country needs a people strategy and act on it immediately.": 1,
    "And such a people strategy consists out of four parts.": 1,
    " Number one, a plan for how to forecast supply and demand for different jobs and different skills.": 1,
    "Workforce planning will become more important than financial planning.": 1,
    " Two, a plan for how to attract trade people.": 1,
    "Generation Y, women, but also retirees.": 1,
    " Three, a plan for how to educate and upskill them.": 1,
    "There's a huge upskilling challenge ahead of us.": 1,
    " and for how to retain the best people, or in other words, how to realize an appreciation and relationship culture.": 1,
    " However, one crucial underlying factor is to change our attitudes.": 1,
    " Employees are resources, are assets, not costs, not headcounts, not machines, not even the Germans.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
