    " So I grew up in East Los Angeles, not even realizing I was poor.": 1,
    "My dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets.": 1,
    "Everyone knew who I was, so I thought it was a pretty big deal.": 1,
    "And I was protected.": 1,
    " And even though my dad spent most of my life in and out of jail, I had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent.": 1,
    "She worked at the local high school as a secretary in the dean's office.": 1,
    " So she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class for whatever reason who were waiting to be disciplined.": 1,
    "Man, her office was packed.": 1,
    " So see, kids like us, we have a lot of things to deal with outside of school.": 1,
    "And sometimes we're just not ready to focus.": 1,
    "But that doesn't mean that we can't.": 1,
    "It just takes a little bit more.": 1,
    " Like I remember one day I found my dad convulsing, foaming at the mouth, ODing on the bathroom floor.": 1,
    "Really, do you think that doing my homework that night was at the top of my priority list?": 1,
    " Not so much.": 1,
    "But I really needed a support network, a group of people who were going to help me make sure that I wasn't going to be a victim of my own circumstance.": 1,
    " that they were going to push me beyond what I even thought I could do.": 1,
    "I needed teachers in the classroom every day who were going to say, you can move beyond that.": 1,
    " And unfortunately, the local junior high was not going to offer that.": 1,
    "It was gang infested, huge teacher turnover rate.": 1,
    " So my mom said, you're going on a bus an hour and a half away from where we live every day.": 1,
    "So the next two years, that's what I did.": 1,
    "I took a school bus to the fancy side of town.": 1,
    " And eventually, I ended up at a school where there was a mixture.": 1,
    "There were some people who were really gang affiliated, and then there was those of us really trying to make it to high school.": 1,
    " Well, trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable.": 1,
    "You had to survive.": 1,
    "You just had to do things sometimes.": 1,
    "So there were a lot of teachers who were like, she's never going to make it.": 1,
    "She has an issue with authority.": 1,
    "She's not going to go anywhere.": 1,
    " Some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause.": 1,
    " But then, they were very surprised when I graduated from high school.": 1,
    "I was accepted to Pepperdine University.": 1,
    " and I came back to the same school that I attended to be a special ed assistant, and then I told them, I want to be a teacher.": 1,
    " And boy, they were like, what?": 1,
    "Why?": 1,
    "Why do you want to do that?": 1,
    "So I began my teaching career at the exact same middle school that I attended.": 1,
    " And I really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me.": 1,
    " And so every year I share my background with my kids because they need to know that everyone has a story, everyone has a struggle, and everyone needs help along the way.": 1,
    " and I am going to be their help along the way.": 1,
    " So as a rookie teacher.": 1,
    " I created opportunity.": 1,
    " I had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before.": 1,
    " I was like, you need to go to a hospital, the school nurse, something.": 1,
    "He's like, no miss, I'm not going.": 1,
    "I need to be in class because I need to graduate.": 1,
    " So he knew that I was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance, but we were going to push forward and keep moving on.": 1,
    " and this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids, and getting to know exactly what they're going through, getting to know their families.": 1,
    "I wanted that.": 1,
    " But I couldn't do it in a school with 1,600 kids and teachers turning over year after year after year.": 1,
    "How do you get to build those relationships?": 1,
    " So we created a new school.": 1,
    "And we created the San Fernando Institute for Applied Media.": 1,
    " And we made sure that we were still attached to our school district for funding for support.": 1,
    " But with that, we were going to gain freedom.": 1,
    "Freedom to hire the teachers that we knew were going to be effective.": 1,
    " freedom to control the curriculum so that we're not doing lesson 1.2 on page five, no.": 1,
    " and freedom to control a budget, to spend money where it matters, not how a district or a state says you have to do it.": 1,
    " We wanted those freedoms.": 1,
    "But now shifting an entire paradigm, it hasn't been an easy journey, nor is it even complete.": 1,
    " But we had to do it.": 1,
    "Our community deserved a new way of doing things.": 1,
    "And as the very first pilot middle school in all of Los Angeles Unified School District,": 1,
    " You better believe there was some opposition.": 1,
    "And it was out of fear.": 1,
    "Fear of, well, what if they get it wrong?": 1,
    "Yeah, what if we get it wrong?": 1,
    "But what if we get it right?": 1,
    " And we did.": 1,
    "So even though teachers were against it because we employ one-year contracts, you can't teach or you don't want to teach, you don't get to be at my school with my kids.": 1,
    " So in our third year, how did we do it?": 1,
    "Well, we're making school worth coming to every day.": 1,
    "We make our kids feel like they matter to us.": 1,
    " We make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them.": 1,
    "And they use all the technology that they're used to.": 1,
    "Laptops, computers, tablets, you name it, they have it.": 1,
    "Animation, software, movie-making software, they have it all.": 1,
    " And because we connect it to what they're doing, for example, they made public service announcements for the cancer society.": 1,
    "These were played in the local trolley system.": 1,
    " Teaching elements of persuasion?": 1,
    "It doesn't get any more real than that.": 1,
    " Our state test scores have gone up more than 80 points since we've become our own school.": 1,
    "But it's taken all stakeholders working together, teachers and principals on one-year contracts, working": 1,
    " over and above beyond their contract hours without compensation.": 1,
    " And it takes a school board member who's going to lobby for you and say, no, the district is trying to impose this, but you have the freedom to do otherwise.": 1,
    " And it takes an active parent center who is not only there showing a presence every day, but who is part of our governance, making decisions for their kids, our kids.": 1,
    " Because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live?": 1,
    " They deserve a quality school in their neighborhood, a school that they can be proud to say they attend, and a school that the community can be proud of as well.": 1,
    " And they need teachers to fight for them every day and empower them to move beyond their circumstances.": 1,
    " Because it's time that kids like me stop being the exception and we become the norm.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
