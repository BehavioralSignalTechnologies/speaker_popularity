    " Have you ever experienced a moment in your life that was so painful and confusing that all you wanted to do was learn as much as you could to make sense of it all?": 1,
    " When I was 13, a close family friend, who was like an uncle to me, passed away from pancreatic cancer.": 1,
    " When the disease hit so close to home, I knew I needed to learn more, so I went online to find answers.": 1,
    "Using the internet, I found a variety of statistics on pancreatic cancer, and what I had found shocked me.": 1,
    " Over 85% of all pancreatic cancers are diagnosed late, when someone has less than a 2% chance of survival.": 1,
    " Why are we so bad at detecting pancreatic cancer?": 1,
    "The reason?": 1,
    "Today's current modern medicine is a 60-year-old technique that's older than my dad.": 1,
    " But also, it's extremely expensive, costing $800 per test.": 1,
    "And it's grossly inaccurate, missing 30% of all pancreatic cancers.": 1,
    " your doctor would have to be ridiculously suspicious that you have the cancer in order to give you this test.": 1,
    " Learning this, I knew there had to be a better way.": 1,
    "So I set up a scientific criteria as to what a sensor would have to look like in order to effectively diagnose pancreatic cancer.": 1,
    " the sensor would have to be inexpensive, rapid, simple, sensitive, selective, and minimally invasive.": 1,
    " Now, there's a reason why this test hasn't been updated in over six decades, and that's because when we're looking for pancreatic cancer,": 1,
    " We're looking at your bloodstream, which is already abundant, all these tons and tons of protein.": 1,
    "And you're looking for this minuscule difference in this tiny amount of protein, just this one protein.": 1,
    "That's next to impossible.": 1,
    " However, undeterred due to my teenage optimism,": 1,
    " I went online to a teenager's two best friends, Google and Wikipedia, got everything from my homework from those two sources.": 1,
    " And what I had found was an article that listed a database of over 8,000 different proteins that are found when you have pancreatic cancer.": 1,
    " So I decided to go and make it my new mission to go through all these proteins and see which ones could serve as a biomarker for pancreatic cancer.": 1,
    " And to make it a bit simpler for myself, I decided to map out scientific criteria.": 1,
    "And here it is.": 1,
    "Essentially, first, the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers.": 1,
    " at high levels in the bloodstream, in the earliest stages, but also only in cancer.": 1,
    "And so I'm just plugging and chugging through this gargantuan task, and finally,": 1,
    " On the 4,000th try, when I'm close to losing my sanity, I find a protein.": 1,
    "And the name of the protein I located was called mesothion.": 1,
    "And it's just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill type protein.": 1,
    " Unless, of course, you have pancreatic, ovarian, and lung cancer, in which case it's found at these very high levels in your bloodstream.": 1,
    "But also, the key is that it's found in the earliest stages of the disease, when someone has close to 100% chance of survival.": 1,
    " So now that I found a reliable protein I could detect, I then shifted my focus to actually detecting that protein and thus pancreatic cancer.": 1,
    " Now, my breakthrough came in a very unlikely place, possibly the most unlikely place for innovation.": 1,
    "My high school biology class, the absolute stifler of innovation.": 1,
    " And I had snuck in this article on these things called carbon nanotubes.": 1,
    "And that's just a long, thin pipe of carbon that's an atom thick and 150,000 the diameter of your hair.": 1,
    " And despite their extremely small sizes, they have these incredible properties.": 1,
    "They're kind of like the superheroes of material science.": 1,
    "And while I was sneakily reading this article under my desk in my biology class, we are supposed to be paying attention to these other kind of cool molecules": 1,
    " called antibodies.": 1,
    "And these are pretty cool because they only react with one specific protein, but they're not nearly as interesting as carbon nanotubes.": 1,
    " And so then I was sitting in class, and suddenly it hit me.": 1,
    "I could combine what I was reading about, carbon nanotubes, with what I was supposed to be thinking about, antibodies.": 1,
    " Essentially, I could weave a bunch of these antibodies into a network of carbon nanotubes, such that you have a network that only reacts with one protein, but also, due to the properties of these nanotubes,": 1,
    " it will change its electrical properties based on the amount of protein present.": 1,
    " However, there's a catch.": 1,
    "These networks of carbon narrow tubes are extremely flimsy.": 1,
    "And since they're so delicate, they need to be supported.": 1,
    "So that's why I chose to use paper.": 1,
    " Making a cancer sensor out of paper is about as simple as making chocolate chip cookies, which I love.": 1,
    " You start with some water, pour in some nanotubes, add antibodies, mix it up, take some paper, dip it, dry it, and you can detect cancer.": 1,
    " Then suddenly a thought occurred that kind of put a blemish on my amazing plan here.": 1,
    "I can't really do cancer research on my kitchen countertop.": 1,
    "My mom wouldn't really like that.": 1,
    " So instead, I decided to go for a lab.": 1,
    "So I typed up a budget, a materials list, a timeline, and a procedure, and I emailed it to 200 different professors at Johns Hopkins University and the National Institutes of Health.": 1,
    " essentially anyone that had anything to do with pancreatic cancer.": 1,
    "They sat back waiting for these positive emails to be pouring in saying, you're a genius, you're going to save us all.": 1,
    " Then reality took hold, and over the course of a month, I got 199 rejections out of those 200 emails.": 1,
    "One professor even went through my entire procedure painstakingly.": 1,
    "I'm not really sure where he got all this time.": 1,
    " And he went through and said why each and every step was like the worst mistake I could ever make.": 1,
    "Clearly the professors did not have as high of an opinion of my work as I did.": 1,
    " However, there was a silver lining.": 1,
    "One professor said, maybe I might be able to help you, kid.": 1,
    "So I went in that direction.": 1,
    " as you can never say no to a kid.": 1,
    " And so then, three months later, I finally nailed down a harsh deadline with this guy.": 1,
    "I get into his lab.": 1,
    "I get all excited.": 1,
    "I sit down.": 1,
    "I start opening my mouth and talking.": 1,
    "And five seconds later, he calls in another PhD.": 1,
    " PhDs just like flock into this little room and they're just firing these questions at me.": 1,
    "And by the end, I kind of felt like I was in a clown car.": 1,
    "There are 20 PhDs plus me and the professor.": 1,
    " crammed into this tiny office space, with them firing these rapid fire questions at me, trying to sync my procedure.": 1,
    "How unlikely is that?": 1,
    "I mean...": 1,
    " However, subjecting myself to that interrogation, I answered all of their questions, and I guessed on quite a few, but I got them right, and I finally landed the lab space I needed.": 1,
    " But it was shortly afterwards that I discovered my once brilliant procedure had something like a million holes in it.": 1,
    "And over the course of seven months, I painstakingly filled each and every one of those holes.": 1,
    "The result?": 1,
    " one small paper sensor that costs three cents and takes five minutes to run.": 1,
    "This makes it 168 times faster, over 26,000 times less expensive, and over 400 times more sensitive": 1,
    " that are current standards for pancreatic cancer detection.": 1,
    " One of the best parts of the sensor, though, is that it has close to 100% accuracy and can detect the cancer in the earliest stages when someone has close to 100% chance of survival.": 1,
    " And so in the next two to five years, this sensor could potentially lift the pancreatic cancer survival rates from a dismal 5.5% to close to 100%, and it would do similar for ovarian and lung cancer.": 1,
    " But it wouldn't stop there.": 1,
    "By switching out that antibody, you can look at a different protein, thus a different disease, potentially any disease in the entire world.": 1,
    " So that ranges from heart disease to malaria, HIV, AIDS, as well as other forms of cancer, anything.": 1,
    " And so hopefully one day, we can all have that one extra uncle, that one mother, that one brother, sister.": 1,
    "We can have that one more family member to love.": 1,
    " and that our hearts will be rid of that one disease burden that comes from pancreatic ovarian and lung cancer and potentially any disease.": 1,
    " that through the internet, anything is possible.": 1,
    "Theories can be shared, and you don't have to be a professor with multiple degrees to have your ideas valued.": 1,
    " is a neutral space, where what you look like, age or gender, it doesn't matter.": 1,
    "It's just your ideas that count.": 1,
    " For me, it's all about looking at the Internet in an entirely new way, to realize that there's so much more to it than just posting duck-faced pictures of yourself online.": 1,
    " You could be changing the world.": 1,
    " So if a 15-year-old who didn't even know what a pancreas was,": 1,
    " could find a new way to detect pancreatic cancer.": 1,
    "Just imagine what you could do.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
