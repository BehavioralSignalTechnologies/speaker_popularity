    " It's okay.": 2,
    "That means...": 2,
    "Like that.": 2,
    " You will understand nothing with my type of English.": 1,
    "It's good for you because you can have a break after all these fantastic people.": 1,
    " After, I must tell you I'm very like that, not very comfortable, because usually in life I think my job is absolutely useless.": 1,
    "It means I feel useless.": 1,
    " Now, after Caroline and all the other guys, I feel like shit.": 1,
    " Andrew.": 1,
    " And definitively, I don't know why I am here, but that looks like, you know, the nightmare you can have that, like you are an imposter.": 1,
    "You arrive at the opera and they push you and say, you must sing.": 1,
    "I don't know, dude.": 1,
    " Soon.": 1,
    " So we, because I have nothing to show.": 1,
    " nothing to say, we shall try to speak about something else.": 1,
    "We can start, if you want, by understanding, just to start, it's not interesting.": 1,
    " How I work.": 1,
    "When somebody come to me and ask for what I am known, means, yes, lemon squeezer, toilet brush.": 1,
    " Toothpick.": 1,
    "Beautiful toilet seats.": 1,
    "And why not a toothbrush?": 1,
    "I don't try to design the toothbrush.": 1,
    "I don't try to say, oh, that will be a beautiful object and things like that.": 1,
    " that don't interest me because there is different type of design.": 1,
    "The one we can call that the cynical design.": 1,
    "That means the design invented by Raymond Loew in the 50s.": 1,
    " who said what is ugly is a bad sale, which is terrible.": 1,
    "That means the design must be just a weapon for marketing.": 1,
    " for producer to make product more sexy like that, they sell more.": 1,
    "It's a shit.": 1,
    "It's obsolete.": 1,
    "It's ridiculous.": 1,
    "After, there is the, I call that the cynical design.": 1,
    " After, there is the narcissistic designer.": 1,
    "It's a fantastic designer.": 1,
    "We design only for other fantastic designers.": 1,
    " After there is people like me who try to deserve to exist and who are so ashamed to make this useless job, who try to do it in a": 1,
    " other way, and they try, I try, to not make the object for the object, but for the result, for the profit for the human being, the person who will use it.": 1,
    "If we take the toothbrush,": 1,
    " If I don't think about it, I think what will be the effect of the brush in the mouth.": 1,
    " To understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth, I must imagine who owns this mouth.": 1,
    " What is the life of the owner of this mouse?": 1,
    "In what society does this guy live?": 1,
    "What civilization creates this society?": 1,
    " what animal species create this civilization.": 1,
    "When I arrive, that takes one minute, I am not so intelligent.": 1,
    " When I arrive at the level of animal species, that becomes really interesting.": 1,
    "Me, I have strictly no power to change anything.": 1,
    "But when I come back, I can understand why I shall not": 1,
    " do it, because today we do not do it, it's more positive than do it, or how I shall do it.": 1,
    " But to come back where I am at the animal species, there are things to see.": 1,
    "There are things to see.": 1,
    "There is the big challenge.": 1,
    "The big challenge in front of us.": 1,
    " Because there is not a human production which exists": 1,
    " out of what I call the big image.": 1,
    "The big image is our story, our poetry, our romanticism.": 1,
    "Our poetry is our mutation, our life.": 1,
    " We must remember, and we can see that in any book of my son of ten years old, that the life appeared four billion years ago, around four billion point two.": 1,
    " Yes, point five, okay, okay, okay.": 1,
    " I'm a designer, that's all, of Christmas gift.": 1,
    "And before there was this soup called soup primordial.": 1,
    "This first soup.": 1,
    " Sort of dirty mud, no life, nothing.": 1,
    "And suddenly, lightning arrives, make life.": 1,
    " Some million years after, wake up.": 1,
    "At the end, finally, that succeeded and life appeared.": 1,
    "We were so": 1,
    " So stupid.": 1,
    "The most stupid bacteria.": 1,
    "Even, I think, we copy our way to reproduce, you know what I mean, on something of crystal... No, forget.": 1,
    " After we become a fish, after we become a frog, after we become a monkey, after we become what we are today, a super monkey,": 1,
    " And the fun is, the super monkey we are today is at half of the story.": 1,
    " Can you imagine, from these stupid bacteria to us, with a microphone, with a computer, with a iPod, four billion years?": 1,
    " And we know, and especially Caroline, know that when the sun will implode,": 1,
    " the earth will burn, explode, I don't know what, and this is scheduled for four billion years.": 1,
    " Yes, she said something like that.": 1,
    "Okay.": 1,
    "That means we are at half of the story.": 1,
    "Fantastic.": 1,
    "It's a beauty.": 1,
    "Can you imagine?": 1,
    "It's very symbolic.": 1,
    "Because the bacteria we was": 1,
    " had no idea of what we are today.": 1,
    "And today, we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years.": 1,
    " And this territory is fantastic.": 1,
    "That is our poetry.": 1,
    "That is our beautiful story.": 1,
    "It's our romanticism.": 1,
    "Mutation.": 1,
    "We are mutant.": 1,
    " And if we don't deeply understand, if we don't integrate that we are mutant, we completely miss the story.": 1,
    " Because every generation thinks we are the final one.": 1,
    "We have a way to look at us like that, you know.": 1,
    "I am the man.": 1,
    " the final man.": 1,
    "You know, we mute during four billion years before, but now, because it's me, we stop.": 1,
    " For the end, for eternity, it is one.": 1,
    "With a red jacket and things like that.": 1,
    " I am not sure of that.": 1,
    " Because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that.": 1,
    "There is so many things to do.": 1,
    "It's so fresh.": 1,
    "And there is something.": 1,
    " Nobody is obliged to be a genius, but everybody is obliged to participate.": 1,
    "And to participate for mutants, there is a minimum of exercise.": 1,
    " minimum of sport, we can say.": 1,
    "The first, if you want, there is so many, but one which is very easy to do is the duty of vision.": 1,
    "I can explain you.": 1,
    "I shall try.": 1,
    " If...": 1,
    "You can walk.": 1,
    "But perhaps because you walk with the eyes like that, you will not see.": 1,
    "There is a hole.": 1,
    "And you will fall and you will die.": 1,
    "Dangerous.": 1,
    "That's why perhaps you will try to": 1,
    " have this angle of vision.": 1,
    "Okay, I can see if there is something.": 1,
    " And I continue, up, up, up, up, up, up.": 1,
    "Arise the angle of vision.": 1,
    "But it's still very selfish.": 1,
    "Selfish, egoist, yes, selfish.": 1,
    "You survive, it's okay.": 1,
    " If you raise the level of your eyes a little more, I see you.": 1,
    "Oh my God, you are here.": 1,
    "How are you?": 1,
    "I can help you.": 1,
    "I can design for you a new toothbrush, a new toilet brush, and things like that.": 1,
    " I live in society, I live in community, it's okay.": 1,
    "You start to be in the territory of intelligence, we can say that.": 1,
    "From this level,": 1,
    " And more you will rise this angle of view, more you will be important for the society.": 1,
    " More you will rise, more you will be important for the civilization.": 1,
    "More you will rise to see": 1,
    " far and high like that, more you will be important for the story of our mutation.": 1,
    "That means intelligent people are in this angle, that is intelligence.": 1,
    " From this to here, that it's a genius.": 1,
    "Ptolemy, Eratosthenes, Einstein, things like that.": 1,
    "Nobody's obliged to be a genius.": 1,
    "It's better, but nobody.": 1,
    " Take care.": 1,
    "In this training, to be a good mutant, there is some danger, there is some trap.": 1,
    "One trap is a vertical.": 1,
    " Because at the vertical of us, if you look like that, oh my God, there is God.": 1,
    "God, God is a trap.": 1,
    "God is the answer when we don't know the answer.": 1,
    " When your brain is not enough big, when you don't understand, oh my God, it's God.": 1,
    "It's God.": 1,
    "That is ridiculous.": 1,
    "That's why jump, this.": 1,
    " and come back like that.": 1,
    "No, not jump.": 1,
    "Come back.": 1,
    "Because after there is another trap.": 1,
    "If you look like that, you look to the past.": 1,
    "Or you look inside if you are very flexible.": 1,
    "Inside yourself.": 1,
    "It's called schizophrenia.": 1,
    "And you are dead also.": 1,
    " That's why every morning now, because you are good mutant, you will raise your angle of view.": 1,
    " out more of the horizontal, you are in intelligence.": 1,
    "Never forget.": 1,
    "It's very, very, very important.": 1,
    " What else we can say about that?": 1,
    "Why do that?": 1,
    "It's because we...": 1,
    " If we look from far, we see our line of evolution.": 1,
    " this line of evolution is clearly positive.": 1,
    "From far, this line looks very smooth like that.": 1,
    "But if you take a length like that, this line is": 1,
    " Like that.": 1,
    "It's made of light and shadow.": 1,
    "We can say light is civilization, shadow is barbaria.": 1,
    " And it's very important to know where we are.": 1,
    "Because some cycle, there is part in the cycle and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle.": 1,
    "That means": 1,
    " That means we can imagine, I don't say it was fantastic, but in the 80s there was not too much war.": 1,
    " like that.": 1,
    "It was we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized.": 1,
    "In this case, people like me": 1,
    " are acceptable.": 1,
    "We can say it's a luxurious time.": 1,
    "We have time to think, we have time to, I don't know what, speak about art and things like that.": 1,
    "It's okay.": 1,
    "We are in the light.": 1,
    "But sometimes, like today,": 1,
    " BWAH!": 1,
    " We fall, we fall so fast, so fast with shadow.": 1,
    "We fall so fast to barbaria.": 1,
    " So with many many many many faiths of barbaria, because it's not as a barbaria we have today, it's not perhaps not the barbaria we think, there is different type of barbaria.": 1,
    " That's why we must adapt.": 1,
    " That means when Barbaria is back, forget the beautiful chairs, forget the beautiful hotel, forget design, even, I'm sorry to say, forget art, forget all that.": 1,
    "There is priority.": 1,
    "There is urgency.": 1,
    " You must go back to politics.": 1,
    "You must go back to radicalization.": 1,
    "I'm sorry if it's not very English.": 1,
    "You must go back to fight, to battle.": 1,
    "That's why today I'm so ashamed to make this job.": 1,
    " That's why I am here to try to do it the best possible.": 1,
    "But I know that even I do it the best possible, that's why I'm the best, it's nothing.": 1,
    "Because it's not the right time.": 1,
    "That's why I say that.": 1,
    " That because, I repeat, nothing exists if it's not in the good rhythm, the rhythm of our beautiful dream of this civilization.": 1,
    " and because we must all work to finish this story.": 1,
    "Because the scenario of this civilization": 1,
    " about love, progress, and things like that, it's okay.": 1,
    "But there are so many different other sceneries of other civilizations.": 1,
    " This scenario of this civilization was about becoming powerful, intelligent, like this idea we have invented, this concept of God.": 1,
    " We are God now.": 1,
    "We are.": 1,
    "It's almost done.": 1,
    "We have just to finish the story.": 1,
    "That is very, very important.": 1,
    "And when you don't understand really what's happened,": 1,
    " You cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that.": 1,
    "You go to the future back like that and you can fall and it's very dangerous.": 1,
    "No, you must really": 1,
    " understand that.": 1,
    "Because we have almost finished, I repeat this story, and the beauty of this, in perhaps 50 years, 60 years, we can finish completely": 1,
    " this civilization and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story, a new poetry, a new romanticism.": 1,
    " With billions of people who have born, work, live and die before us, these people have worked so much.": 1,
    "We have now bring": 1,
    " Beautiful thing, beautiful gift, we know so many things.": 1,
    "We can say to our children, okay.": 1,
    " done.": 1,
    "That was our story.": 1,
    "That passed.": 1,
    "Now you have a duty.": 1,
    "Invent a new story.": 1,
    "Invent a new poetry.": 1,
    "The only rule is": 1,
    " We have not to have any idea about the next story.": 1,
    "We give you a white pages invent.": 1,
    " we give you the best tools and now do it.": 1,
    "That's why I continue to work even if it's for toilet brush.": 1
