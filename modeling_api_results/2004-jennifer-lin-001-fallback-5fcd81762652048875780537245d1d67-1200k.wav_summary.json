    " you": 36,
    " so": 10,
    "Thank you.": 2,
    "Okay.": 2,
    " The End": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1,
    "Like the speaker before me, I am a TED version, I guess.": 1,
    "I'm also the first time here, and I don't know what to say.": 1,
    " I'm really happy that Mr. Anderson invited me.": 1,
    "I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone.": 1,
    "And the song that I just played was by Joseph Hoffman.": 1,
    "It's called Kaleidoscope.": 1,
    "And Hoffman is": 1,
    " a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century.": 1,
    "And he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time.": 1,
    " I have another piece that I'd like to play for you.": 1,
    "It's called Abeg Variations by Robert Schumann, a German 19th...": 1,
    " century composer.": 1,
    "The name Abeg.": 1,
    "Abeg is actually A-B-E-G-G and that's the main theme of the melody.": 1,
    " that comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends.": 1,
    " But he wrote that for his wife.": 1,
    " So actually, if you listen carefully, there's supposed to be five variations on this abeg theme.": 1,
    "It's written around 1834, so even though it's old, I hope you like it.": 1,
    " Now comes the part that I hate.": 1,
    " Well, because Mr. Anderson told me that this session is called Sync and Flow, I was wondering what do I know that these geniuses don't?": 1,
    " So I'll talk about musical composition, even though I don't know where to start.": 1,
    "How do I compose?": 1,
    "I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose.": 1,
    " What I do first is I make a lot of little musical ideas you can just improvise here at the piano, and I choose one of those to become my main theme, my main melody, like the oboe that you just heard.": 1,
    " And once I choose my main theme, I have to decide out of all the styles of music, what kind of style do I want.": 1,
    " And this year I composed a romantic style.": 1,
    "So for inspiration I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky and all the great romantic composers.": 1,
    " Next I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers.": 1,
    "They help me plan out the whole piece and then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas because then you have to think.": 1,
    " And then when the piece takes somewhat of a solidified form, you're supposed to": 1,
    " actually polish the piece, polish the details and then polish the overall performance of the composition.": 1,
    " And another thing that I enjoy doing is drawing.": 1,
    "Drawing because I like to draw Japanese anime art.": 1,
    "I think that's a craze among teens right now.": 1,
    " And once I realized it, there's a parallel between creating music and creating art, because for your motive or your little initial idea for your drawing,": 1,
    " It's your character.": 1,
    "You want to decide who do you want to draw, or if you want to draw an original character.": 1,
    "And then you want to decide how are you going to draw the character.": 1,
    "Am I going to use one page?": 1,
    "Am I going to draw it on a computer?": 1,
    "Am I going to use...": 1,
    " two-page spread like a comic book for more grandiose effect, I guess.": 1,
    "And then you have to do the initial sketch of the character, which is like your structure of a piece.": 1,
    " And then you add pen and pencil and whatever details that you need.": 1,
    "That's polishing the drawing.": 1,
    "And another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind.": 1,
    "Because I know I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted.": 1,
    " So if I'm trying to do homework, if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it, I'll try to draw or, you know, waste my time.": 1,
    " And then what happens is sometimes I absolutely can't draw or I can't compose at all.": 1,
    "And then it's like there's too much on your mind.": 1,
    "You can't focus on what you're supposed to do.": 1,
    " And sometimes if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it, you'll get something out of it, but it doesn't come naturally.": 1,
    " What happens is if something magical happens, if something natural happens to you, you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly.": 1,
    " And then that's what I consider flow, because that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything.": 1,
    "You feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want.": 1,
    " I'm not going to play my own composition today because although I did finish it, it's way too long.": 1,
    "Instead, I'd like to try something called improvisation.": 1,
    " I have here seven note cards, one with each note of the musical alphabet, and I'd like someone to come up here and choose five.": 1,
    " Anyone to come up here and choose five and then I can make it into some sort of melody and I'll improvise it.": 1,
    " Wow!": 1,
    "A volunteer, yay!": 1,
    " Nice to meet you.": 1,
    "I guess, yes, five cards, any five cards.": 1,
    "One.": 1,
    "Two.": 1,
    "Yes.": 1,
    "Three.": 1,
    " Oh, DNF, too familiar.": 1,
    " Okay.": 1,
    "E for effort.": 1,
    "Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them?": 1,
    " And E. Thank you very much.": 1,
    "You're welcome.": 1,
    "And what about these?": 1,
    "I won't use them.": 1,
    " Now she chose CGBAE.": 1,
    "I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order.": 1,
    " Okay, that's nice.": 1,
    "So I'm gonna have a moment to think and I'll try to make something out of it.": 1,
    " Piano plays": 1,
    " The next song or the encore that I'm gonna play is called Bumble Boogie by Jack Fina.": 1
