    " I'd like to ask you, what do these three people have in common?": 1,
    "Well, you probably recognize the first person.": 1,
    "I'm sure you're all avid American Idol watchers.": 1,
    " But you might not recognize Ida al-Jahani, who is a contestant, indeed a finalist, in the Poet of the Millions competition, which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi and seen throughout the Arab world.": 1,
    "In this contest,": 1,
    " People have to write and recite original poetry in the Nabati form of poetry, which is a traditional Bedouin form.": 1,
    " And Lima Sahar was a finalist in the Afghan Star Singing Competition.": 1,
    " Now, before I go any further, yes, I know it all began with Britain's Got Talent, but my point in discussing this is to show you, I hope I'll be able to show you how": 1,
    " these merit-based competitions with equal access to everyone with the winner selected by voting via SMS are changing tribal societies and I'm going to focus on Afghanistan": 1,
    " and the Arab world with the UAE, how they're changing tribal societies, not by introducing Western ideas, but by being integrated into the language in those places.": 1,
    "It all begins with enjoyment.": 1,
    " I don't know what to do.": 1,
    " These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society.": 1,
    "In Afghanistan, people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program.": 1,
    " And you don't necessarily have to have your own TV set.": 1,
    "People watch it all over the country also in public places.": 1,
    "But it goes beyond watching.": 1,
    " because also part of this is campaigning.": 1,
    "People become so engaged that they have volunteers just like political volunteers anyway.": 1,
    " who fan out over the countryside, campaigning for their candidate.": 1,
    "The contestants also put themselves forward.": 1,
    " Now, and of course, there's a certain degree of ethnic allegiance, but not entirely because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group.": 1,
    " This has opened up the door particularly for women, and in the last season there were two women in the finalists.": 1,
    "One of them, Lima Sahar, is a Pashtun from Kandahar, a very conservative part of the country.": 1,
    " And here she relates in the documentary film Afghan Star how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy.": 1,
    " but she also confides that she knows that members of the Taliban are actually SMSing votes in for her.": 1,
    " Ida al-Jahani also took risks and put herself out to compete in the Poet of the Millions competition.": 1,
    "I have to say her husband backed her from the start, but her tribe and family urged her not to compete.": 1,
    " and were very much against it.": 1,
    "But once she started to win, then they got behind her again.": 1,
    "It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value.": 1,
    "And she's out there": 1,
    " Her poetry is about women and the life of women in society.": 1,
    "So just by presenting herself and being in competition with men, this shows the voting on the program.": 1,
    " It sets a very important example for young women.": 1,
    "These are young women in the audience of the program in Abu Dhabi, but also people in the viewing audience.": 1,
    " Now you'd think that American Idol would introduce a measure of Americanization, but actually just the opposite is happening.": 1,
    "By using this engaging popular format,": 1,
    " for traditional local culture it actually in the Gulf is precipitating a revival of interest in the body poetry also in traditional dress and dance and music and for Afghanistan.": 1,
    " where the Taliban banned music for many years, it is reintroducing their traditional music.": 1,
    "They don't sing pop songs.": 1,
    " They sing Afghan music.": 1,
    "And they also have learned how to lose gracefully without avenging the winner.": 1,
    " and the no small thing and the final": 1,
    " The final sort of formulation of this American Idol format, which has just appeared in Afghanistan is a new program called the candidate.": 1,
    "And in this program, people present policy platforms that are then voted on.": 1,
    " Many of them are too young to run for president, but by putting the issues out there, they are influencing the presidential race.": 1,
    "So for me, the substance of Things Unseen is how reality TV is driving reality.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
