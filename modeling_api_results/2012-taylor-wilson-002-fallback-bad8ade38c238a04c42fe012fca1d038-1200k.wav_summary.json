    " So my name is Taylor Wilson.": 1,
    "I am 17 years old, and I am a nuclear physicist, which may be a little hard to believe, but I am.": 1,
    "And I would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that": 1,
    " point that the bridge that T. Boone Pickens talked about will get us to.": 1,
    "So nuclear fusion is our energy future.": 1,
    "And the second point making the case that kids can really change the world.": 1,
    "So you may ask how to...": 1,
    " You may ask me, well how do you know what our energy future is?": 1,
    "Well, I built a fusion reactor when I was 14 years old.": 1,
    " That is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor.": 1,
    "I started building this project when I was about 12 or 13 years old.": 1,
    "I decided I wanted to make a star.": 1,
    "Now, most of you are probably saying, oh, well...": 1,
    " There's no such thing as nuclear fusion.": 1,
    "I don't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy.": 1,
    "Well, it doesn't break even.": 1,
    "It doesn't produce more energy out than I put in.": 1,
    "But it still does some pretty cool stuff.": 1,
    " I assembled this in my garage.": 1,
    "It now lives in the physics department of the University of Nevada, Reno.": 1,
    "It slams together deuterium, which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it.": 1,
    " So this is similar to the reaction, the proton chain that's going on inside the sun.": 1,
    "And I'm slamming it together so hard that that hydrogen fuses together.": 1,
    "And in the process, it has some byproducts, and I utilize those byproducts.": 1,
    " So this previous year, I won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.": 1,
    "I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that Homeland Security has for": 1,
    " Hundreds of dollars I've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars.": 1,
    "I built this, you know, in my garage.": 1,
    " And I've developed a system to produce medical isotopes.": 1,
    "Instead of requiring multi-million dollar facilities, I've developed a device that on a very small scale can produce these isotopes.": 1,
    "So that's my fusion reactor in the background there.": 1,
    " That is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor.": 1,
    " Oh, by the way, I make yellow cake in my garage, so my nuclear program is as advanced as the Iranians, so maybe you don't want to admit to that.": 1,
    " This is me at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world.": 1,
    "And this is me with President Obama, showing him my homeland security research.": 1,
    " So in about seven years of doing nuclear research, I started out with a dream to make a star in a jar, a star in my garage.": 1,
    " and I end up meeting the president and developing things that I think can change the world and I think other kids can too.": 1,
    "So thank you very much.": 1
