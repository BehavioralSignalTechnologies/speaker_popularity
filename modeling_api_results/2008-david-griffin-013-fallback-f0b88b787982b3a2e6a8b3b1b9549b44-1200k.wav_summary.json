    " Let's just start by looking at some great photographs.": 1,
    " This is an icon of National Geographic, an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry.": 1,
    "But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out with a parody of National Geographic, and I shudder to think what they are going to do to this photograph.": 1,
    " Oh, the wrath of Photoshop.": 1,
    " This is a jet landing at San Francisco by Bruce Dale.": 1,
    "He mounted a camera on the tail.": 1,
    " poetic image for a story on Tolstoy by Sam Abel.": 1,
    " Pygmies in the DRC by Randy Olson.": 1,
    "I love this photograph because it reminds me of Degas' bronze sculpture as a little dancer.": 1,
    " A polar bear swimming in the Arctic by Paul Nicklin.": 1,
    "Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth.": 1,
    "They're not very good swimmers, and we know what's happening to the ice.": 1,
    " These are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa, photographed by Chris Johns.": 1,
    "Shot straight down, so these are the shadows of the camels.": 1,
    " This is a rancher in Texas by William Albert Allard, a great portraitist.": 1,
    " and Jane Goodall making her own special connection, photographed by Nick Nichols.": 1,
    " This is a soap disco in Spain, photographed by David Allen Harvey.": 1,
    "And David said that there was a lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor.": 1,
    "But hey, at least it's hygienic.": 1,
    " These are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance by David Dubelet.": 1,
    " And this is a comet captured by Dr. Ewan Mason.": 1,
    " And finally, The Bow of the Titanic without movie stars, photographed by Emery Kristoff.": 1,
    " Photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl today's saturated media world.": 1,
    "Because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment.": 1,
    "Here's an example.": 1,
    " Four years ago, I was at the beach with my son, and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches.": 1,
    "But I turned away for a moment, and he got caught into a riptide and started to be pulled out towards a jetty.": 1,
    " I can stand here right now and see as I go tearing into the water after him, the moment slowing down and freezing into this arrangement, I can see the rocks.": 1,
    " are over here.": 1,
    "There's a wave about to crash onto him.": 1,
    "I can see his hands reaching out and I can see his face in terror looking at me saying, help me dad.": 1,
    " I got him, the wave broke over us, we got back on shore, he was fine, we were a little bit rattled.": 1,
    " But this flash bulb memory, as it's called, is when all the elements came together to define not just the event, but my emotional connection to it.": 1,
    " And this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer.": 1,
    "Now, I have to tell you, I was talking to Kyle last week.": 1,
    " About this that I was going to tell this story and he said oh, yeah, I remember that too I remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me": 1,
    " I thought I was a hero.": 1,
    " So.": 1,
    " So this represents, this is a cross sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists working at the very top of their craft, except one.": 1,
    " This photograph was taken by Dr. Ewan Mason in New Zealand last year and it was submitted and published in National Geographic.": 1,
    "Last year we added a section to our website called Your Shot where anyone can submit photographs": 1,
    " for possible publication and it has become a wild success tapping into the enthusiast photography community.": 1,
    "The quality of these amateur photographs": 1,
    " can at times be amazing.": 1,
    "And seeing this reinforces for me that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them.": 1,
    " But to be a great photojournalist, you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you.": 1,
    "You've got to be able to make them all the time.": 1,
    " But even more importantly, you need to know how to create a visual narrative.": 1,
    "You need to know how to tell a story.": 1,
    "So I'm going to share with you some coverages that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography.": 1,
    " Photographer Nick Nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary in Chad called Zacoma.": 1,
    " The original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species of an exotic locale.": 1,
    "And that is what Nick did up to a point.": 1,
    " This is a serval cat.": 1,
    "He's actually taking his own picture shot with what's called a camera trap.": 1,
    "There's an infrared beam that's gunning across, and he's stepped into the beam and taken his photograph.": 1,
    " These are baboons at a watering hole.": 1,
    "The camera, again, an automatic camera, took thousands of pictures of this and Nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of baboons.": 1,
    " The lion having a late night snack notice he's got a broken tooth.": 1,
    " and a crocodile walks up a riverbank towards its den.": 1,
    "I love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail.": 1,
    " But the centerpiece species of Zacoma are the elephants.": 1,
    "It's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa.": 1,
    "Here is a photograph shot in moonlight, something that digital photography has made a big difference for.": 1,
    "It was with the elephants that this story pivoted.": 1,
    " Nick, along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay, collared the matriarch of the herd, they named her Annie, and they began tracking her movements.": 1,
    "The herd was safe within the confines of the park because of this dedicated group of park rangers.": 1,
    " But once the annual rains began, the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park, and that's when they ran into trouble.": 1,
    "For outside the safety of the park were poachers who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks.": 1,
    " The matriarch that they were radio tracking after weeks of moving back and forth in and out of the park came to a halt outside the park.": 1,
    "Annie had been killed along with 20 members of her herd.": 1,
    " and they only came for the ivory.": 1,
    " And this is actually one of the rangers.": 1,
    "They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory because they couldn't leave it there because it's still valuable.": 1,
    "But what Nick did...": 1,
    " was he brought back was a story that went beyond the old school method of just straight isn't this an amazing world and instead": 1,
    " created a story that touched our audiences deeply.": 1,
    "Instead of just knowledge of this park, he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants, the rangers, and the many issues surrounding human wildlife conflicts.": 1,
    " Now let's go over to India.": 1,
    "Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way.": 1,
    "We were looking at the same issue that Richard Rerman touches upon in his New World Population Project for the first time in history.": 1,
    " More people live in urban, rather than rural, environments.": 1,
    "And most of that growth is not in the cities, but in the slums that surround them.": 1,
    " Jonas Bendixson, a very energetic photographer, came to me and said, we need to document this, and here's my proposal.": 1,
    "Let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world.": 1,
    " And I said, well, you know, that might be a bit ambitious for our budget.": 1,
    "So instead, what we did was we decided to, instead of going out and doing what would result in what we consider sort of a survey story, where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything,": 1,
    " We put Jonas into Dharavi, which is part of Mumbai, India, and let him stay there and really get into the heart and soul of this.": 1,
    " really major part of the city.": 1,
    "What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places.": 1,
    "He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned.": 1,
    " By staying tightly focused in one place, Jonah's tapped in to the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community.": 1,
    " and he did it in a beautiful way.": 1,
    " Sometimes, though, the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture.": 1,
    "We teamed up underwater photographer Brian Scarry and photojournalist Randy Olson to document the depletion of the world's fisheries.": 1,
    " We weren't the only ones to tackle this subject, but the photographs that Brian and Randy created are among the best to capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing.": 1,
    "Here in a photo by Brian, a seemingly crucified shark is caught up": 1,
    " in a gill net off of Baja.": 1,
    "I've seen sort of okay pictures of bycatch, the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species, but here Brian captured a unique view": 1,
    " by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard.": 1,
    " And Brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never before made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom.": 1,
    " Back on land, Randy Olson photographed a makeshift fish market in Africa where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals, the main parts having already been sent to Europe.": 1,
    " And here in China, Randy shot a jellyfish market.": 1,
    "As prime food sources are depleted, the harvest goes deeper into the oceans and brings in more such sources of protein.": 1,
    "This is called fishing down the food chain.": 1,
    " But there are also glimmers of hope.": 1,
    "And I think anytime we're doing a big, big story on this, we don't really want to go and just look at all the problems.": 1,
    "We also want to look for solutions.": 1,
    " Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand where commercial fishing had been banned, the result being that the overfished species have been restored and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries.": 1,
    " Photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial.": 1,
    "James Knockway, who was honored last year at last year's TED,": 1,
    " took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq.": 1,
    "It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home on the other.": 1,
    "Jim started in the battlefield, here": 1,
    " A medical technician attends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital.": 1,
    "Here is in the field hospital, the soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest as a reminder of home.": 1,
    " From here, the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany, where they meet up with their families for the first time.": 1,
    " and then back to the states to recuperate at veterans' hospitals such as here in Walter Reed.": 1,
    "And finally, often fitted with high-tech prosthesis, they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre-war lives.": 1,
    " Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply.": 1,
    " Now these stories are great examples of how photography can be used to address some of our most important topics.": 1,
    " But there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it, just plain fun.": 1,
    "Photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals.": 1,
    "They have been rarely photographed, partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean.": 1,
    " In fact, a year earlier, a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed.": 1,
    "So you can imagine, Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water.": 1,
    " Now, what leopard seals do mostly is they eat penguins.": 1,
    "You know the march of the penguins?": 1,
    "This is sort of the munch of the penguins.": 1,
    " Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear and then everybody kind of runs out and goes out.": 1,
    " But then Paul got in the water, and he said he was never really afraid of this, well this one female came up to him, she's probably, it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph, but she's 12 feet long.": 1,
    " So she is pretty significant in size.": 1,
    "And Paul said he was never really afraid because she was more curious about him than threatened.": 1,
    "This mouthing behavior on the right was really her way of saying to him, hey, look how big I am, or my, what big teeth you have.": 1,
    " We'll be right back.": 1,
    " Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him.": 1,
    "To her, here was this big, goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn't seem to be interested in chasing penguins.": 1,
    " So what she did was she started to bring penguins to him alive and put them in front of him.": 1,
    " She dropped them off, and then they would swim away.": 1,
    "She'd kind of look at them, go, what are you doing?": 1,
    "Go back and get them, and then bring them back and drop them in front of him.": 1,
    "And she did this for over the course of a couple of days.": 1,
    " until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head.": 1,
    " which just resulted in a fantastic photograph.": 1,
    " Eventually though, Paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive.": 1,
    "This is her kind of just puffing out, you know, snorting out in sort of disgust.": 1,
    " and lost interest with him and went back to what she does best.": 1,
    "Paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature and came back with not just a collection of photographs, but an amazing experience and a great story.": 1,
    " It is these kinds of stories, ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial, that demonstrate the power of photojournalism.": 1,
    " I believe that photography can make a real connection to people and can be employed as a positive agent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today.": 1,
