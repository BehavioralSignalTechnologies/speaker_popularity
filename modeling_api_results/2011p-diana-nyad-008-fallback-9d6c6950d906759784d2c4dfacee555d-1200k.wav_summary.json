    " Thank you.": 6,
    " Yeah.": 2,
    "Thank you.": 2,
    " Yeah, so a couple of years ago I was turning 60 and I don't like being 60.": 1,
    " And I started grappling with this existential angst of what little I had done with my life.": 1,
    " It wasn't the resume of, you know, breaking this record here.": 1,
    "It was more like, who would I become?": 1,
    "How would I spend my valuable time?": 1,
    "How could this have gone by like lightning?": 1,
    " And I couldn't forgive myself for the countless, countless hours I had lost in negative thought.": 1,
    " All the time I had spent beating myself up for losing my marriage and not stopping the sexual abuse when I was a kid.": 1,
    " and career moves and this and this and this.": 1,
    "Just why?": 1,
    "Why didn't I do it better?": 1,
    "Why, why, why?": 1,
    "And then my mother died.": 1,
    " at 82, and so I'm starting thinking not only am I not happy with the past, now I'm getting choked with I've only got 22 years left.": 1,
    " What am I going to do with this short amount of time that's just fleeting and I'm not in the present whatsoever?": 1,
    "And I decided the remedy to all this malaise was going to be for me to chase": 1,
    " an elevated dream, an extreme dream, something that would require": 1,
    " Utter conviction.": 1,
    " and unwavering passion, something that would make me be my best self in every aspect of my life, every minute of every day, because the dream was so big that I couldn't get there.": 1,
    " without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction and I decided": 1,
    " It was an old dream that was lingering.": 1,
    "It was from so many years ago, three decades ago.": 1,
    "The only sort of world-class swim I had tried and failed at back in my 20s was going from Cuba to Florida.": 1,
    " It was deep in my imagination.": 1,
    "No one's ever done it without a shark cage.": 1,
    "It's daunting.": 1,
    "It's more than a hundred miles across a difficult passage of ocean.": 1,
    " It's probably at my speed, at my age, for anybody's speed, at anybody's age, going to take 60, maybe 70 hours of continuous swimming, never getting out on the boat.": 1,
    " And I started to train.": 1,
    "I hadn't swum for 31 years, not a stroke.": 1,
    "And I had kept in good shape, but swimming's a whole different animal.": 1,
    "As a matter of fact, this picture is supposed to be me.": 1,
    " during training, it's a smiling face.": 1,
    "And when you're training for this sport, you are not smiling.": 1,
    " It's an arduous, difficult sport, and I don't remember smiling at any time during this sport.": 1,
    " As I said, I respect other sports and I compare this sport sometimes to cycling and to mountain climbing and other of the expedition type events, but this is a sensory deprivation, a physical duress.": 1,
    " And when I started in with the eight hours and the 10 hours and the 12 hours and the 14 hours and the 15 hours and the 24 hours swims, I knew I had it.": 1,
    " because I was making it through these and when I said I'm going to go out and do a 15 hour swim and we're coming into the dock after a long day and it's now night and we come in and it's 14 hours and 58 minutes and I can touch the dock and we're done the trainer says": 1,
    " That's great, it's 14 hours, 58 minutes, who cares the last two minutes?": 1,
    "I say no, it's gotta be 15 hours and I swim another minute out and another minute back.": 1,
    " to make the 15 hours, and I put together an expedition.": 1,
    "It's not that I didn't have help, but honestly, I sort of led, I was the team leader.": 1,
    " And to get the government permissions, you think you're reading the paper, it's easy to get into Cube every day?": 1,
    "Try going in with an armada, like we had, of 50 people and five boats and CNN's crew, etc.": 1,
    " The navigation is difficult.": 1,
    "There's a big river called the Gulf Stream that runs across here, and it's not going in the direction you are.": 1,
    "It's going to the east, and you'd like to go north.": 1,
    " It's tricky, and there's dehydration, and there's hypothermia, and there are sharks,": 1,
    " And there are all kinds of problems, and I gather together, honestly, the world's leading experts in every possible way.": 1,
    "And a month ago, the 23rd,": 1,
    " September I stood on that shore and I looked across that to that long long faraway horizon and I asked myself Do you have it?": 1,
    "Are your shoulders ready and they were?": 1,
    " They were prepared, no stone left unturned.": 1,
    "Was the mind ready?": 1,
    " You know, you're swimming with the fogged goggles.": 1,
    "You're swimming at 60 strokes a minute.": 1,
    "So you're never really focused on anything.": 1,
    "You don't see well.": 1,
    "You've got tight bathing caps over your ears trying to keep the heat of the head.": 1,
    " So that's where the hypothermia starts.": 1,
    "And so you don't hear very well.": 1,
    "You're really left alone with your own thoughts.": 1,
    "And I had all kinds of counting systems ready there in English, followed by German, followed by Spanish, followed by French.": 1,
    " You saved the French for last.": 1,
    " And I had songs, I had a playlist in my head.": 1,
    "It's not through headphones in my own head of 65 songs.": 1,
    "And I couldn't wait to get into the dark in the middle of the night, because that's when Neil Young comes out.": 1,
    " And it's odd, isn't it?": 1,
    "You think you'd be singing Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah out in the majesty of the ocean, not songs about heroin addiction in New York City.": 1,
    "But no, for some reason, I couldn't wait to get into the dark of the night and be singing": 1,
    " I'll be right back.": 1,
    " I heard you knocking at my cellar door.": 1,
    "I love you, baby, and I want some more.": 1,
    "Oh, the damage done.": 1,
    " The night before I started, I finished Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design.": 1,
    "And I couldn't wait to trip the mind fantastic about the 50th hour I was going to start thinking about": 1,
    " The edge of the universe, is there an edge?": 1,
    "Is this an envelope we're living inside of or no?": 1,
    "Does it go on to infinity in both time and space and there's nothing like swimming for 50 hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this.": 1,
    " I couldn't wait to prove the athlete I am, that nobody else in the world can do this swim.": 1,
    "And I knew I could do it.": 1,
    "And when I jumped into that water, I yelled in my mother's French, Courage!": 1,
    " And I started swimming and oh my God, it was glassy.": 1,
    "And we knew it, all 50 people on the boat, we all knew this was it.": 1,
    " This was our time.": 1,
    "And I reminded myself a couple hours in, you know, the sport is sort of a microcosm of life itself.": 1,
    "First of all, you're going to hit obstacles.": 1,
    " And even though you're feeling great at any one moment, don't take it for granted.": 1,
    "Be ready, because there's going to be pain, there's going to be suffering.": 1,
    "It's not going to feel this good all the way across.": 1,
    " And I was thinking of the hypothermia and maybe some shoulder pain and, you know, all the other things, the vomiting that comes from being in the salt water.": 1,
    "You're immersed in a liquid that": 1,
    " Your body doesn't like the salt water.": 1,
    "After a couple of days, three days, you tend to, you know, rebel in a lot of physical ways.": 1,
    "But no, two hours in, wham!": 1,
    " never in my life.": 1,
    "I knew there were Portuguese men of war, all kinds of moon jellies, all kinds of things, but the box jellyfish from the southern oceans is not supposed to be in these waters.": 1,
    "And I was on": 1,
    " fire, excruciating, excruciating pain.": 1,
    "I don't know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm.": 1,
    " Evidently a piece this big of tentacle has a hundred thousand little barbs on it and each barb": 1,
    " is not just stinging your skin, it's sending a venom.": 1,
    "The most venomous animal that lives in the ocean is the box jellyfish, and every one of those barbs is sending that venom into the central nervous system.": 1,
    " So first I feel like boiling hot oil I've been dipped in and I'm yelling out fire fire fire fire help me somebody help me and the next thing": 1,
    " is paralysis.": 1,
    "I feel it in the back and then I feel it in the chest up here and I can't breathe and now I'm not swimming with a nice long stroke.": 1,
    "I'm sort of crabbing it this way.": 1,
    "Then come convulsions": 1,
    " young man on our boat is an EMT he dives in to try to help me he's stung they drag him out on the boat and he's evidently I didn't see any of this but lying on the boat and giving himself epinephrine shots": 1,
    " And crying out, he's 29 years old, very well built, lean, he's 6 foot 5, weighs 265 pounds, and he is dead.": 1,
    " down and he's crying and he's yelling to my trainer who's trying to help me and he's saying, Bonnie, I think I'm going to die.": 1,
    "My breath is down to three breaths a minute.": 1,
    " I need help and I can't help Diana.": 1,
    "So that was at eight o'clock at night.": 1,
    "The doctor medical team from University of Miami arrived at five in the morning.": 1,
    " So I swam through the night and at dawn they got there and they started with prednisone shots.": 1,
    "I didn't get out, but it was in the water taking prednisone shots, taking Xanax, oxygen to the face.": 1,
    "It was like an ICU unit in the water.": 1,
    " I'm sorry.": 1,
    " And I guess the story is that even Navy SEALs who are stung by the box jelly, they're done.": 1,
    "They either die or they quickly get to a hospital and I swam through the night and I swam through the next day.": 1,
    "And the next night at dusk,": 1,
    " Again, wham, the box jelly again, all across the neck, all across here.": 1,
    "And this time, I don't like it, I didn't want to give into it, but there's a difference between a nonstop swim and a staged swim.": 1,
    " and I gave in to the stage swim and they got me out and they started again with the epinephrine and with the prednisone and with the oxygen and everything they had on board and I got back in.": 1,
    " and I swam through that night and into the next day and at 41 hours this body": 1,
    " Couldn't make it.": 1,
    " The devastation of those stings had taken the respiratory system down so that I couldn't make the progress I wanted.": 1,
    "And the dream was crushed.": 1,
    " And how odd is this intelligent person who put this together and got all these world experts together.": 1,
    "And I knew about the jellyfish, but I was sort of cavalier.": 1,
    "A lot of athletes have this sort of": 1,
    " invincibility, you know, they should worry about me.": 1,
    "I don't worry about them.": 1,
    "I'll just swim right through them.": 1,
    "We've got Benadryl on board.": 1,
    "If I get stung, I'll just grin and bear it.": 1,
    " Well, there's no grin in bearing this.": 1,
    "As a matter of fact, the best advice I got was from an elementary school class in": 1,
    " the Caribbean.": 1,
    "And I was telling these kids, 120 of them, they were all in the school, the gymnasium floor, and I was telling them about the jellyfish and how they're gelatinous and they're": 1,
    " You know, you can't see them at night especially and they have these long 30 to 40 to 50 foot tentacles and they do this wrapping and they can send the poison into the system.": 1,
    "A little kid from the back was like this and I said, what's your name?": 1,
    "Henry.": 1,
    " Henry, what's your question?\"": 1,
    "He said, well, I didn't have a question so much as I had a suggestion.": 1,
    "He said,": 1,
    " those guys who really believe in what they believe in, and so they wear bombs.": 1,
    "And I said, well, it's odd that you've learned of this as a noble, noble kind of pursuit.": 1,
    "But yeah, I know those guys.": 1,
    "He said, that's what you need.": 1,
    "You need like a school of fish.": 1,
    " that would swim in front of you like this.": 1,
    " And when the jellyfish come and they wrap their tentacles around the fish, they're going to be busy with them, and you'll just scoot around.": 1,
    "I said, it's like a suicide army.": 1,
    "He said, that's what I'm talking about.": 1,
    "That's what you need.": 1,
    " And little did I know that you should listen to eight-year-olds.": 1,
    "And so I started that swim in a bathing suit like normal, and no joke, this is it.": 1,
    "It came from the shark divers.": 1,
    "I finished the swim like this.": 1,
    " I was swimming with this thing on.": 1,
    "That's how scared of the jellyfish I was.": 1,
    " So now what do I do?": 1,
    " I wouldn't mind if every one of you came up on this stage tonight.": 1,
    " and told us how you've gotten over the big disappointments of your lives.": 1,
    "Because we've all had them, haven't we?": 1,
    "We've all had a heartache.": 1,
    "And so my journey now is to find some sort of grace in the face of this defeat.": 1,
    " And I can look at the journey, not just the destination.": 1,
    "I can feel proud.": 1,
    "I can stand here in front of you tonight and say I was courageous.": 1,
    " And with all sincerity, I can say I'm glad I lived those two years of my life that way because my goal to not suffer regrets anymore, I got there with that goal.": 1,
    "When you live that way, when you live with that kind of passion, there's no time.": 1,
    " There's no time for regrets.": 1,
    "You're just moving forward.": 1,
    "And I want to live every day the rest of my life that way, swim or no swim.": 1,
    "But the difference in accepting this particular defeat is that sometimes if": 1,
    " Cancer has won.": 1,
    " If there is death and we have no choice, then grace and acceptance are necessary.": 1,
    " But that ocean is still there.": 1,
    "This hope is still alive.": 1,
    " And I don't want to be the crazy woman who does it for years and years and years and tries and fails and tries and fails and tries and fails, but I can swim from Cuba to Florida and I will swim from Cuba to Florida.": 1,
    " And so what after that?": 1,
    "You're going to swim the Atlantic?": 1,
    "No?": 1,
    "That's the last swim.": 1,
    "It's the only swim I'm interested in.": 1,
    "But.": 1,
    " I'm ready.": 1,
    "And by the way, a reporter called me the other day and he said he looked on Wikipedia and he said he saw my birthday.": 1,
    "It was August 22nd, 1949.": 1,
    "And for some odd reason in Wikipedia, they had my death date too.": 1,
    " He said, did you know you're going to die the same place you were born, New York City, and it's going to be in January of 35.": 1,
    "I said, no.": 1,
    "I didn't know.": 1,
    "And now I'm going to live to 85.": 1,
    "I have three more years than I thought.": 1,
    " And so I ask myself, I'm starting to ask myself now, even before this extreme dream gets achieved for me, I'm asking myself, and maybe I can ask you tonight too, to paraphrase.": 1,
    " to paraphrase the poet.": 1,
    " Mary Oliver.": 1,
    "She says, so.": 1,
    " What is it?": 1,
    "What is it you're doing with this one wild and precious life of yours?": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1,
    " Live in large!": 1,
    "Live in large!": 1
