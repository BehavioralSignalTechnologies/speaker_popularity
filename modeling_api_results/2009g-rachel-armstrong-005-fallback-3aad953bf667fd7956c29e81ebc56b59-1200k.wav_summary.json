    " All buildings today have something in common.": 1,
    "They're made using Victorian technologies.": 1,
    "This involves blueprints,": 1,
    " industrial manufacturing and construction using teams of workers.": 1,
    "All of this effort results in an inert object and that means that there's a one-way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities.": 1,
    " This is not sustainable.": 1,
    "I believe that the only way that it is possible for us to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities is by connecting them to nature, not insulating them from it.": 1,
    " Now in order to do this, we need the right kind of language.": 1,
    "Living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism.": 1,
    " And this is the conversion of one group of substances into another, either through the production or the absorption of energy.": 1,
    "And this is the way in which living materials make the most of their local resources in a sustainable way.": 1,
    " So I'm interested in the use of metabolic materials for the practice of architecture.": 1,
    " but they don't exist, so I'm having to make them.": 1,
    "I'm working with architect Neil Spiller at the Bartlett School of Architecture, and we're collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom-up approach.": 1,
    "That means we're generating them from scratch.": 1,
    " One of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanzak and he's really interested in the transition from inert to living matter.": 1,
    "Now that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in when we're thinking about sustainable materials.": 1,
    " So Martin, he works with a system called the protocell.": 1,
    "Now all this is, and it's magic, it's a little fatty bag, and it's got a chemical battery in it, and it has no DNA.": 1,
    " This little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living.": 1,
    "It is able to move around its environment.": 1,
    " It can follow chemical gradients, and it can undergo complex reactions, some of which are happily architectural.": 1,
    "So here we are.": 1,
    "These are protocells patterning their environment.": 1,
    "We don't know how they do that yet.": 1,
    " Here, this is a protocell and it's vigorously shedding this skin.": 1,
    "Now this looks like a chemical kind of birth.": 1,
    "This is a violent process.": 1,
    " Here we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into carbonate, and that's the shell around that lobular frat.": 1,
    "They're quite brittle, so you've only got a part one there.": 1,
    " So what we're trying to do is we're trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom-up construction approaches for architecture which contrast the current Victorian top-down methods which impose structure upon matter that can't be energetically sensible.": 1,
    " So, bottom-up materials actually exist today.": 1,
    "They've been in use in architecture since ancient times.": 1,
    "If you walk around the city of Oxford where we are today,": 1,
    " and have a look at the brickwork, which I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days, you'll actually see that a lot of it's made of limestone.": 1,
    "And if you look even closer, you'll see in that limestone there are little shells and little skeletons that are piled upon each other.": 1,
    " And then they're fossilised over millions of years.": 1,
    "Now, a block of limestone in itself isn't particularly that interesting.": 1,
    "It looks beautiful.": 1,
    " But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere.": 1,
    "Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide.": 1,
    " Would it give this block of limestone new properties?": 1,
    "Well, most likely it would.": 1,
    "It might be able to grow, it might be able to self-repair and even respond to dramatic changes in the immediate environment.": 1,
    " So, architects are never happy with just one block of an interesting material.": 1,
    "They think big.": 1,
    " When we think about scaling up metabolic materials, we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of atolls or reclamation of parts of a city that are damaged by water.": 1,
    " So one of these examples would of course be the historic city of Venice.": 1,
    "Now Venice as you know has a tempestuous relationship with the sea and is built upon wooden piles.": 1,
    " So we've devised a way by which it may be possible for the protocell technology that we're working with to sustainably reclaim Venice.": 1,
    " and architect Christian Kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city.": 1,
    " So here's the technology we have today.": 1,
    "This is our Predator technology effectively making a shell like its limestone forefathers.": 1,
    " and depositing it in a very complex environment against natural materials.": 1,
    "We're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding processes in this.": 1,
    " Now this is the very interesting part.": 1,
    "We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals.": 1,
    "What we need it to do is to be creatively crafted around the wooden piles.": 1,
    " So you can see from these diagrams that the protocells are actually moving away from the light towards the dark foundations.": 1,
    "We've observed this in the laboratory.": 1,
    "The protocells can actually move away from the light.": 1,
    "They can actually also move towards the light.": 1,
    "You have to just choose your species.": 1,
    " So these don't just exist as one entity, we kind of chemically engineer them.": 1,
    "And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically around the foundations of Venice, effectively petrifying it.": 1,
    " Now this isn't going to happen tomorrow.": 1,
    "It's going to take a while.": 1,
    "It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out on a case-by-case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice.": 1,
    " But gradually, as the buildings are repaired, we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city.": 1,
    "And accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.": 1,
    " Also, it will attract the local marine ecology, who will find their own ecological nieces within this architecture.": 1,
    " Now we have an architecture that connects the city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way.": 1,
    " But perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere.": 1,
    "This is terrestrial chemistry.": 1,
    "We've all got it.": 1,
    "Which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries": 1,
    " as it is for first world countries.": 1,
    "So in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials as a counter pose to Victorian technologies and building architectures from a bottom up approach.": 1,
    " Secondly, these metabolic materials have some of the properties of living systems, which means they can perform in similar ways.": 1,
    "They can expect to have a lot of forms and functions within the practice of architecture.": 1,
    " And finally, an observer in the future marvelling at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
