    "I'll zoom in a little bit.": 2,
    " What I do is I organize information.": 1,
    "I'm a graphic designer.": 1,
    "Professionally, I try to make sense, often of things that don't make much sense themselves.": 1,
    " So my father might not understand what it is that I do for a living.": 1,
    "His part of my ancestry has been farmers.": 1,
    "He's part of this ethnic minority called Pontic Greeks.": 1,
    " They lived in Asia Minor and fled to Greece after a genocide about a hundred years ago.": 1,
    " And ever since that, migration has somewhat been a theme in my family.": 1,
    "My father moved to Germany, studied there, and married.": 1,
    " And as a result, I now have this half German brain with all the analytical thinking and that slight dorky demeanor that come with that.": 1,
    " And of course it meant that I was a foreigner in both countries.": 1,
    "And that of course made it pretty easy for me to migrate as well.": 1,
    "In good family tradition, if you like.": 1,
    " But of course, most journeys that we undertake from day to day are within a city.": 1,
    "And especially if you know the city, getting from A to B may seem pretty obvious, right?": 1,
    " But the question is, why is it obvious?": 1,
    "How do we know where we're going?": 1,
    " So I washed up on a Dublin ferry port about 12 years ago.": 1,
    "A professional foreigner if you like.": 1,
    "And I'm sure you've all had this experience before.": 1,
    "You arrive in a new city and your brain is trying to make sense of this new place.": 1,
    " Once you find your base, your home,": 1,
    " you start to build this cognitive map of your environment.": 1,
    "It's essentially this virtual map that only exists in your brain.": 1,
    " All animal species do it, even though we all use slightly different tools.": 1,
    "Us humans, of course, we don't move around marking our territory by scent like dogs.": 1,
    " We don't run around emitting ultrasonic squeaks like bats.": 1,
    "We just don't do that.": 1,
    "Although a night in the Temple Bar district can get pretty wild.": 1,
    " No, we do two important things to make a place our own.": 1,
    "First, we move along linear routes.": 1,
    "Typically we find a main street.": 1,
    " And this main street becomes a linear strip map in our minds.": 1,
    "But our mind keeps it pretty simple.": 1,
    "Every street is generally perceived as a straight line.": 1,
    "And we kind of ignore the little twists and turns that the streets make.": 1,
    " When we do however make a turn into a side street, our mind tends to adjust that turn to a 90 degree angle.": 1,
    " This of course makes for some funny moments when you're in some old city layout that follows some sort of circular city logic.": 1,
    " Maybe you've had that experience as well, right?": 1,
    "Let's say you are on some spot on a side street that projects from a main cathedral square, and you want to get to another point on a side street just like that.": 1,
    " The cognitive map in your mind may tell you, Iris, go back to the main cathedral square, take a 90-degree turn, and walk down that other side street.": 1,
    " But somehow you feel adventurous that day, and you suddenly discover that the two spots were actually only a single building apart.": 1,
    "Now, I don't know about you, but I always feel like I find this wormhole or this interdimensional portal.": 1,
    " So we move along linear routes and our mind straightens streets and perceives turns as 90-degree angles.": 1,
    "The second thing that we do to make a place our own": 1,
    " is we attach meaning and emotions to the things that we see along those lines.": 1,
    " If you go to the Irish countryside and you ask an old lady for directions, brace yourself for some elaborate Irish storytelling about all the landmarks.": 1,
    " She'll tell you the pub where her sister used to work and go past that church where I got married, that kind of thing.": 1,
    "So we fill our cognitive maps with these markers of meaning.": 1,
    " What's more, we abstract repeat patterns and recognize them.": 1,
    "We recognize them by the experiences and we abstract them into symbols.": 1,
    "And of course,": 1,
    " We are all capable of understanding these symbols.": 1,
    " What's more, we are all capable of understanding the cognitive maps, and you are all capable of creating these cognitive maps yourselves.": 1,
    "So next time when you want to tell your friend how to get to your place,": 1,
    " You grab a beer mat, grab a napkin.": 1,
    " And you just observe yourself, create this awesome piece of communication design.": 1,
    "It's got straight lines, it's got 90-degree corners, you might add little symbols along the way.": 1,
    " And when you look at what you've just drawn,": 1,
    " you realize it does not resemble a street map.": 1,
    "If you were to put an actual street map on top of what you've just drawn, you'd realize your streets and the distances, they'd be way off.": 1,
    " No, what you've just drawn is more like a diagram or a schematic.": 1,
    "It's a visual construct of lines, dots, letters designed in the language of our brains.": 1,
    " So it's no big surprise that the big information design icon of the last century, the pinnacle of showing everybody how to get from A to B the London Underground map,": 1,
    " was not designed by a cartographer or a city planner.": 1,
    "It was designed by an engineering draftsman.": 1,
    " In the 1930s, Harry Beck applied the principles of schematic diagram design and changed the way public transport maps are designed forever.": 1,
    " Now the very key to the success of this map is in the omission of important, less important information and in the extreme simplification.": 1,
    " So, straightened streets, corners of 90 and 45 degrees, but also the extreme geographic distortion in that map.": 1,
    " If you were to look at the actual locations of these stations, you'd see they're very different.": 1,
    "But this is all for the clarity of the public tube map.": 1,
    " If you wanted to get from Regent's Park station to Great Portland Street, the tube map would tell you, take the tube, go to Baker Street, change over, take another tube.": 1,
    "Of course, what you don't know is,": 1,
    " that the two stations are only about 100 meters apart.": 1,
    "Now we've reached the subject of public transport.": 1,
    "And public transport here in Dublin is this somewhat touchy subject.": 1,
    " For everybody who does not know the public transport here in Dublin, essentially we have this system of local buses that grew with the city.": 1,
    " For every outskirt that was added, there was another boss route added running from the outskirt all the way to the city centre.": 1,
    " And as these local buses approach the city center, they all run side by side and converge in pretty much one main street.": 1,
    "So when I stepped off the boat 12 years ago,": 1,
    " I try to make sense of that.": 1,
    " Because exploring a city on foot only gets you so far.": 1,
    "But when you explore a foreign and new public transport system, you will build a cognitive map in your mind in pretty much the same way.": 1,
    " Typically, you choose yourself a rapid transport route, and in your mind, this route is perceived as a straight line.": 1,
    " And like a pearl necklace, all the stations and stops are nicely and neatly aligned along the line.": 1,
    "And only then you start to discover some local bus routes.": 1,
    " that would fill in the gaps and that allow you for those wormhole interdimensional portal shortcuts.": 1,
    " So I tried to make sense.": 1,
    "And when I arrived, I was looking for some information leaflets that would help me crack this system and understand it.": 1,
    "And I found those brochures.": 1,
    " They were not geographically distorted.": 1,
    "They were having a lot of omission of information, but unfortunately the wrong information.": 1,
    "Say in the city centre, there were never actually any lines that showed the routes.": 1,
    " There are actually not even any stations with names.": 1,
    " Now the maps of Dublin Transport have gotten better, and after I finished the project, they got a good bit better, but still no station names, still no routes.": 1,
    " So being naive and being half German,": 1,
    " I decided, Aris, why don't you build your own map?": 1,
    "So that's what I did.": 1,
    "I researched how each and every bus route moved through the city.": 1,
    " Nice and logical, every bus route a separate line.": 1,
    " and I plotted it into my own map of Dublin.": 1,
    "And in the city centre,": 1,
    " I got a nice spaghetti plate.": 1,
    " Now...": 1,
    " This is a bit of a mess, so I decided, of course, you're going to apply the rules of schematic design, cleaning up the corridors, widening the streets where there were loads of buses, and making the streets straight.": 1,
    " 90 degree corners, 45 degree corners, or fractions of that, and filled it in with the bus routes.": 1,
    "And I built a city center bus map of the system how it was five years ago.": 1,
    " I'll zoom in again so that you get the full impact of the keys and the Westmoreland Street.": 1,
    " Now I can proudly say...": 1,
    " I can proudly say...": 1,
    " As a public transport map, this diagram is an utter failure.": 1,
    " except probably in one aspect.": 1,
    "I now had a great visual representation of just how clogged up and overrun the city centre really was.": 1,
    " Now, call me old-fashioned, right?": 1,
    "But I think a public transport route map should have lines.": 1,
    "Because that's what they are, yeah?": 1,
    "They're little pieces of string that wrap their way through the city center, or through the city.": 1,
    " If you will, the Greek guy inside of me feels if I don't get a line, it's like entering the labyrinth of the Minotaur without having Ariadne giving you the string to find your way.": 1,
    "So the outcome of my academic research": 1,
    " loads of questionnaires, case studies, and looking at a lot of maps, was that a lot of the problems and shortcomings of the public transport system here in Dublin was the lack of a coherent public transport map.": 1,
    " a simplified coherent public transport map.": 1,
    "Because I think this is the crucial step to understanding a public transport network on a physical level, but it's also the crucial step to make a public transport network mappable on a visual level.": 1,
    " So I teamed up with a gentleman called James Leahy.": 1,
    " a civil engineer and a recent master's graduate of sustainable development program at DIT.": 1,
    "And together we drafted the simplified model network which I could then go ahead and visualize.": 1,
    " So here's what we did.": 1,
    "We distributed these rapid transport corridors throughout the city center and extended them into the outskirts.": 1,
    " rapid because we wanted them to be served by rapid transport vehicles.": 1,
    "They would get exclusive road use where possible.": 1,
    " and it would be high quantity, high quality transport.": 1,
    "James wanted to use bus rapid transport for that, rather than light rail.": 1,
    "For me, it was important that the vehicles that would run on those rapid transport corridors": 1,
    " would be visibly distinguishable from local buses on the street.": 1,
    " Now we could take out all the local buses that ran alongside those rapid transport means.": 1,
    "Any gaps that appeared in the outskirts were filled again.": 1,
    "So in other words, if there was a street in an outskirt where there had been a bus,": 1,
    " we put a bus back in.": 1,
    "Only now these buses wouldn't run all the way to the city center, but connect to the nearest rapid transport mode.": 1,
    "One of these thick lines over there.": 1,
    " So the rest was merely a couple of months of work and a couple of fights with my girlfriend of our place constantly being clogged up with maps.": 1,
    " And the outcome, one of the outcomes was this map of the greater Dublin area.": 1,
    " This map only shows the rapid transport connections, no local bus, very much in the Metro's map style that was so successful in London.": 1,
    " since has been exported to so many other major cities and therefore is the language that we should use for public transport maps.": 1,
    " What's also important is, with a simplified network like this, it now would become possible for me to tackle the ultimate challenge and make a public transport map for the city centre.": 1,
    " One where I wouldn't just show rapid transport connections, but also all the local bus routes, streets, and the likes.": 1,
    "And this is what a map like this could look like.": 1,
    " In this map, I'm including each transport mode.": 1,
    " So, rapid transport, bus, dart, tram and the likes.": 1,
    "Each individual route is represented by a separate line.": 1,
    " The map shows each and every station": 1,
    " Each and every station name.": 1,
    " And I'm also displaying side streets.": 1,
    "In fact, most of the side streets, even with their name.": 1,
    " And for good measure, also a couple of landmarks.": 1,
    "Some of them signified by little symbols, others by these isometric three-dimensional bird's-eye view drawings.": 1,
    " The map is relatively small in overall size, so something that you could still hold as a fold-out map or display in a reasonably sized display box on a bus shelter.": 1,
    " it tries to be the best balance between actual representation": 1,
    " And simplification, the language of wayfinding in our brain.": 1,
    "So straightened lines, cleaned up corners.": 1,
    " And of course that very, very important geographic distortion that makes public transport maps possible.": 1,
    " If you, for example, have a look at the two main corridors that run through the city, the yellow and orange one over here, this is how they look in an actual, accurate street map.": 1,
    " And this is how they would look in my distorted, simplified public transport map.": 1,
    " For a successful public transport map, we should not stick to accurate representation, but design them in the way our brains work.": 1,
    "The reactions I got were tremendous.": 1,
    "It was really good to see.": 1,
    " And of course for my own self I was very happy to see that my folks in Germany and Greece finally have an idea what I do for a living.": 1
