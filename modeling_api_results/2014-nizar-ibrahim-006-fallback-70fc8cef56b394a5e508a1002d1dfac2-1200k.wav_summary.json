    " These dragons from deep time are incredible creatures.": 1,
    "They're bizarre.": 1,
    "They're beautiful.": 1,
    " And there's very little we know about them.": 1,
    "These thoughts were going through my head when I looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book.": 1,
    " I was about five years old at the time, and I decided there and then that I would become a paleontologist.": 1,
    "Paleontology allowed me to combine my love for animals with my desire to travel to far-flung corners of the world.": 1,
    " And now, a few years later, I've led several expeditions to the ultimate far-flung corner on this planet, the Sahara.": 1,
    " I've worked in the Sahara because I've been on a quest to uncover new remains of a bizarre giant predatory dinosaur called Spinosaurus.": 1,
    " A few bones of this animal have been found in the deserts of Egypt and were described about a hundred years ago by a German paleontologist.": 1,
    " Unfortunately, all his Spinosaurus bones were destroyed in World War II.": 1,
    "So all we are left with are just a few drawings and notes.": 1,
    " From these drawings, we know that this creature, which lived about 100 million years ago, was very big.": 1,
    "It had tall spines on its back, forming a magnificent sail.": 1,
    "And it had long, slender jaws, a bit like a crocodile.": 1,
    " with conical teeth that may have been used to catch slippery prey like fish.": 1,
    "But that was pretty much all we knew about this animal for the next 100 years.": 1,
    " My field work took me to the border region between Morocco and Algeria.": 1,
    " A place called the Chem Chem.": 1,
    "It's a difficult place to work in.": 1,
    "You have to deal with sandstorms and snakes and scorpions.": 1,
    "And it's very difficult to find good fossils there.": 1,
    "But our hard work paid off.": 1,
    " We discovered many incredible specimens.": 1,
    "This is the largest dinosaur bone that had ever been found in this part of the Sahara.": 1,
    "We found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs, medium-sized predatory dinosaurs.": 1,
    " and seven or eight different kinds of crocodile-like hunters.": 1,
    "These fossils were deposited in a river system.": 1,
    "The river system was also home to a giant car-sized coelacanth.": 1,
    " a monster sawfish, and the skies over the river system were filled with pterosaurs, flying reptiles.": 1,
    "It was a pretty dangerous place, not the kind of place where you'd want to travel to if you had a time machine.": 1,
    " So we're finding all these incredible fossils of animals that lived alongside Spinosaurus, but Spinosaurus itself proved to be very elusive.": 1,
    "We're just finding bits and pieces, and I was hoping that we would find a partial skeleton at some point.": 1,
    " Finally, very recently, we were able to track down a dig site where a local fossil hunter found several bones of Spinosaurus.": 1,
    " We returned to the site, we collected more bones, and so after a hundred years, we finally had another partial skeleton of this bizarre creature, and we were able to reconstruct it.": 1,
    "We now know that Spinosaurus had a head a little bit like a crocodile.": 1,
    " Very different from other predatory dinosaurs.": 1,
    "Very different from T. rex.": 1,
    " But the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton.": 1,
    " We had long spines, the spines forming the big sail.": 1,
    "We had leg bones.": 1,
    "We had skull bones.": 1,
    "We had paddle-shaped feet, wide feet.": 1,
    "Again, very unusual.": 1,
    "No other dinosaur has feet like this.": 1,
    " and we think they may have been used to walk on soft sediment or maybe for paddling in the water.": 1,
    "We also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone, the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones, and it turns out that they're very dense and compact.": 1,
    " Again, this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water.": 1,
    "It's useful for buoyancy control in the water.": 1,
    "We CT-scanned all of our bones and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton.": 1,
    " And when we looked at the digital skeleton, we realized that, yes, this was a dinosaur unlike any other.": 1,
    "It's bigger than T-Rex.": 1,
    " And yes, the head has fish eating written all over it, but really the entire skeleton has water loving written all over it.": 1,
    "Dense bone.": 1,
    " paddle-like feet.": 1,
    "And the hind limbs are reduced in size.": 1,
    "And again, this is something we see in animals that spend a substantial amount of time in the water.": 1,
    " So as we fleshed out our spinosaurus, looking at muscle attachments and wrapping our dinosaur in skin,": 1,
    " We realized that we're dealing with a river monster, a predatory dinosaur bigger than T-Rex, the ruler of this ancient river of giants, feeding on the many aquatic animals I showed you earlier on.": 1,
    " So that's really what makes this an incredible discovery.": 1,
    "It's a dinosaur like no other.": 1,
    "And some people told me, wow, this is a once in a lifetime discovery.": 1,
    "There are not many things left to discover in the world, right?": 1,
    "Well, I think nothing could be further from the truth.": 1,
    " I think the Sahara is still full of treasures, and when people tell me there are no places left to explore, I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter, Roy Chapman Andrews, and he said,": 1,
    " Always there has been an adventure just around the corner, and the world is still full of corners.": 1,
    "That was true many decades ago when Roy Chapman Andrews wrote these lines, and it is still true today.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
