    " My passions are music, technology, and making things.": 1,
    "And it's the combination of these things that has led me to the hobby of sound visualization, and on occasion has led me to play with fire.": 1,
    " This is a Rubens tube, it's one of many I've made over the years and I have one here tonight.": 1,
    "It's about an eight foot long tube of metal, it's got a hundred or so holes on top.": 1,
    "On that side is a speaker and here is some lab tubing and it's connected to this tank of propane.": 1,
    " So.": 1,
    " Let's fire it up and see what it does.": 1,
    " So let's play a 550 hertz frequency and watch what happens.": 1,
    " It's okay to applaud the laws of physics, but essentially what's happening here...": 1,
    " is the energy from the sound via the air and gas molecules is influencing the combustion properties of propane creating a visible waveform.": 1,
    " And we can see the alternating regions of compression and rarefaction that we call frequency, and the height is showing us amplitude.": 1,
    "So let's change the frequency of the sound and watch what happens to the fire.": 1,
    " So every time we hit a resonant frequency, we get a standing wave and that emergent sine curve of fire.": 1,
    "So let's turn that off.": 1,
    "We're indoors.": 1,
    " I also have with me a flame table.": 1,
    "It's very similar to Ruben's tube and it's also used for visualizing the physical properties of sounds such as the eigenmode.": 1,
    "So let's fire it up and see what it does.": 1,
    " Oof.": 1,
    " Okay, now, while the table comes up to pressure, let me note here that the sound is not traveling in perfect lines.": 1,
    "It's actually traveling in all directions, and the Rubin's tube's a little like bisecting those waves with a line, and the flame table's a little like bisecting those waves with a plane.": 1,
    " and it can show a little more subtle complexity, which is why I like to use it to watch Jeff Farina play guitar.": 1,
    " so": 1,
    " All right, so it's a delicate dance.": 1,
    "If you watch closely.": 1,
    " If you watch closely, you may have seen some of the eigenmodes, but also you may have seen that jazz music is better with fire.": 1,
    " Actually, a lot of things are better with fire in my world, but the fire is just a foundation.": 1,
    "It shows very well that eyes can hear, and this is interesting to me because": 1,
    " Technology allows us to present sound to the eyes in ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes for seeing sound, such as the removal of time.": 1,
    " So here I'm using a rendering algorithm to paint the frequencies of the song Smells Like Teen Spirit in a way that the eyes can take them in as a single visual impression.": 1,
    " And the technique will also show the strengths of the visual cortex for pattern recognition.": 1,
    "So if I show you another song off this album and another.": 1,
    " your eyes will easily pick out the use of repetition by the band Nirvana.": 1,
    "And in the frequency distribution, the colors, you can see the clean, dirty, clean sound that they are famous for.": 1,
    " And here is the entire album as a single visual impression.": 1,
    "And I think this impression is pretty powerful.": 1,
    "At least it's powerful enough if I show you these four songs.": 1,
    "And I remind you that this smells like teen spirit.": 1,
    " You can probably correctly guess without listening to any music at all that the song a die-hard Nirvana fan would enjoy is this song.": 1,
    "I'll stick around by the Foo Fighters, whose lead singer is Dave Grohl, who was the drummer in Nirvana.": 1,
    " The songs are a little similar, but mostly I'm just interested in the idea that someday maybe we'll buy a song because we like the way it looks.": 1,
    " All right, now for some more sound data.": 1,
    "This is data from a skate park, and this is Mabel Davis skate park in Austin, Texas.": 1,
    " And the sounds you're hearing came from eight microphones attached to obstacles around the park, and it sounds like chaos.": 1,
    "But actually, all the tricks start with a very distinct slap.": 1,
    "But successful tricks end with a pop, whereas unsuccessful tricks more of a scratch and a tumble.": 1,
    " And tricks on the rail will ring out like a gong.": 1,
    "And voices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park.": 1,
    "So if we were to render these sounds visually, we might end up with something like this.": 1,
    " This is all 40 minutes of the recording.": 1,
    "And right away the algorithm tells us a lot more tricks are missed than are made.": 1,
    "And also a trick on the rail is a lot more likely to produce a cheer.": 1,
    " And if you look really closely, we can tease out traffic patterns.": 1,
    "You see the skaters often trick in this direction.": 1,
    "The obstacles are easier.": 1,
    "And the middle of the recording, the mics pick this up.": 1,
    "But later in the recording, this kid shows up.": 1,
    " And he starts using a line at the top of the park to do some very advanced tricks on something called the tall rail.": 1,
    "And it's fascinating.": 1,
    "At this moment in time, all the rest of the skaters turn their lines 90 degrees to stay out of his way.": 1,
    " You see, there's a subtle etiquette in a skate park, and it's led by key influencers, and they tend to be the kids who can do the best tricks or wear red pants.": 1,
    "And on this day, the mics picked that up.": 1,
    " All right.": 1,
    "From skate physics to theoretical physics, I'm a big fan of Stephen Hawking, and I wanted to use all eight hours of his Cambridge lecture series to create an homage.": 1,
    " In this series, he's speaking with the aid of a computer, which actually makes identifying the ends of sentences fairly easy.": 1,
    " So I wrote a steering algorithm.": 1,
    "It listens to the lecture, and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x-axis, and it uses the inflection of sentences to move the same point up and down on the y-axis.": 1,
    " And these trend lines, you can see there's more questions than answers in the laws of physics.": 1,
    "And when we reach the end of a sentence, we place a star at that location.": 1,
    "So there's a lot of sentences, so a lot of stars.": 1,
    "And after rendering all of the audio, this is what we get.": 1,
    " This is Stephen Hawking's universe.": 1,
    " It's all eight hours of the Cambridge lecture series taken in as a single visual impression.": 1,
    "And I really like this image, but a lot of people think it's fake.": 1,
    "So I made a more interactive version.": 1,
    "And the way I did that is I used": 1,
    " their position in time in the lecture to place these stars into 3D space.": 1,
    "And with some custom software and a Kinect, I can walk right into the lecture.": 1,
    "I'm going to wave to the Kinect here and take control.": 1,
    "And now I'm going to reach out.": 1,
    " And I'm going to touch a star, and when I do, it will play the sentence that generated that star.": 1,
    "There is one, and only one, arrangement in which the pieces make a complete picture.": 1,
    " There are 1,400 stars.": 1,
    "It's a really fun way to explore the lecture, and I hope a fitting homage.": 1,
    "All right.": 1,
    "Let me close with a work in progress.": 1,
    " I think after 30 years, the opportunity exists to create an enhanced version of closed captioning.": 1,
    "Now, we've all seen a lot of TED Talks online, so let's watch one now with the sound turned off and the closed captioning turned on.": 1,
    " There's no closed captioning for the Ted theme song, and we're missing it.": 1,
    "But if you've watched enough of these, you hear it in your mind's ear.": 1,
    "And then applause starts.": 1,
    " It usually begins here and it grows and then it falls.": 1,
    "Sometimes you get a little star applause and I think even Bill Gates takes a nervous breath and the talk begins.": 1,
    "All right, so.": 1,
    " Let's watch this clip again.": 1,
    "This time, I'm not going to talk at all.": 1,
    "There's still going to be no audio.": 1,
    "But what I am going to do is I'm going to render the sound visually in real time at the bottom of the screen.": 1,
    "So watch closely and see what your eyes can hear.": 1,
    " This is fairly amazing to me.": 1,
    "Even on the first view, your eyes will successfully pick out patterns.": 1,
    " But on repeated views, your brain actually gets better at turning these patterns into information.": 1,
    "You can get the tone and the timbre and the pace of the speech, things that you can't get out of closed captioning.": 1,
    " That famous scene in horror movies where someone is walking up from behind is something you can see.": 1,
    "And I believe this information would be something that's useful at times when the": 1,
    " audio is turned off or not heard at all.": 1,
    "And I speculate that deaf audiences might actually even be better at seeing sound than hearing audiences.": 1,
    "I don't know.": 1,
    "It's a theory right now, actually.": 1,
    "It's all just an idea.": 1,
    " And let me end by saying that sound moves in all directions, and so do ideas.": 1
