    " Why not?": 2,
    "That may not always be the case.": 2,
    " 13 years ago, we...": 1,
    " set themselves a goal to end poverty.": 1,
    " After some success, we've hit a big hurdle.": 1,
    " The aftermath of the financial crisis has begun to hit aid payments, which have fallen for two consecutive years.": 1,
    " My question is whether the lessons learned from saving the financial system": 1,
    " can be used to help us overcome that hurdle and help millions.": 1,
    "Can we simply print money for aid?": 1,
    " Surely not.": 1,
    "It's a common reaction.": 1,
    " It's Quick Talk.": 1,
    " Others channel John McEnroe.": 1,
    "You cannot be serious!": 1,
    "Now, I can't do the accent, but I am serious.": 1,
    " Thanks to...": 1,
    " these two children, whom as you'll learn, are very much the heart of my talk.": 1,
    " On the left, we have Pia.": 1,
    "She lives in England.": 1,
    "She has two loving parents, one of whom is standing right here.": 1,
    " Dorothy, on the right, lives in rural Kenya.": 1,
    "She's one of 13,000 orphans and vulnerable children that are assisted by a charity that I support.": 1,
    " I do that because I believe that Dorothy, like Pierre, deserves the best life chances that we can afford to give her.": 1,
    " You'll all agree with me, I'm sure.": 1,
    "The UN agrees too.": 1,
    "Their overriding aim for international aid is to strive for a life of dignity for all.": 1,
    " But.": 1,
    " And here's that hurdle.": 1,
    "Can we afford our aid aspirations?": 1,
    " History suggests not.": 1,
    " In 1970, governments set themselves a target to increase overseas aid payments to 0.7% of their national income.": 1,
    " As you can see, a big gap opens up between actual aid and that target.": 1,
    " But then come the Millennium Development Goals, eight ambitious targets to be met by 2015.": 1,
    "If I tell you that just one of those targets": 1,
    " is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty.": 1,
    "You get a sense of the ambition.": 1,
    "There's also been some success.": 1,
    " the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day has halved.": 1,
    " But a lot remains to be done in two years.": 1,
    " One in eight remain hungry.": 1,
    " In the context of this auditorium, the front two rows aren't going to get any food.": 1,
    " We can't settle for that, which is why the concern about the eighth goal, which relates to funding, which I said at the beginning, is falling.": 1,
    " is so troubling.": 1,
    " That's what can be done.": 1,
    " Well, I work in financial markets, not development.": 1,
    " I study the behavior of investors, how they react to policy and the economy.": 1,
    " gives me a different angle on the aid issue.": 1,
    " But it took an innocent question from my then four-year-old daughter to make me appreciate that.": 1,
    " Pierre and I were on the way to a local cafe, and we passed a man collecting for charity.": 1,
    " He didn't have any change to give him, and she was disappointed.": 1,
    " Once in the cafe, Pia takes out her coloring book and starts scribbling.": 1,
    "After a little while, I ask her what she's doing.": 1,
    " And she shows me a drawing of a five pound note to give to the man outside.": 1,
    "It's so sweet.": 1,
    "More generous than that would it be.": 1,
    " But of course I can explain to you, you can't do that.": 1,
    "It's not allowed.": 1,
    "To which I get the classic four-year-old response.": 1,
    " Now I'm excited because I actually think I can answer this time.": 1,
    "So I launch in to an explanation of how an unlimited supply of money": 1,
    " chasing a limited number of goods sends prices to the moon.": 1,
    " Something about that exchange stuck with me.": 1,
    " Not because of the look of relief on Piers' face when I finally finished.": 1,
    " but because it related to the sanctity of the money supply.": 1,
    " a sanctity that had been challenged and questioned by the reaction of central banks to the financial crisis.": 1,
    " To reassure investors, central banks began buying assets.": 1,
    " to try and encourage investors to do the same.": 1,
    " They funded these purchases.": 1,
    " with money they created themselves.": 1,
    " The money wasn't actually physically printed.": 1,
    " It's still sort of locked away in the banking system today.": 1,
    "But the amount created was unprecedented.": 1,
    " Together, the central banks of the US, UK and Japan increased the stock of money in their economies by $3.7 trillion.": 1,
    " That's three times, in fact it's more than three times the total physical stock of dollar notes in circulation.": 1,
    "Three times!": 1,
    " Before the crisis, this would have been utterly unthinkable.": 1,
    " Yet, it was accepted.": 1,
    " remarkably quickly.": 1,
    " Price of gold, an asset thought to protect against inflation, did jump.": 1,
    " But investors bought other assets that offered little protection from inflation.": 1,
    "They bought fixed income securities, bonds.": 1,
    "They bought equities too.": 1,
    " For all the scare stories, the actual actions of investors spoke of rapid acceptance and confidence.": 1,
    " That confidence.": 1,
    " was based on two pillars.": 1,
    " The first was that after years of keeping inflation under control,": 1,
    " Central banks were trusted to take the money printing away": 1,
    " if inflation became a threat.": 1,
    " Secondly,": 1,
    " Inflation simply never became a threat.": 1,
    "As you can see in the United States, inflation for most of this period remained below average.": 1,
    " It was the same elsewhere.": 1,
    " So how does all this relate to aid?": 1,
    "Well, this is where Dorothy and the mango tree charity that supports her comes in.": 1,
    " I was at one of their fundraising events earlier this year and I was inspired to give a one-off donation when I remembered that my firm offers to match the charitable contributions its employees make.": 1,
    " So think of this.": 1,
    "Instead of just being able to help Dorothy and four of her classmates to go through secondary school for a few years, I was able to double my contribution.": 1,
    " Brilliant.": 1,
    " So following that conversation with my daughter,": 1,
    " and seeing the absence of inflation in the face of money printing and knowing that international aid payments were falling at just the wrong time.": 1,
    " This made me wonder.": 1,
    " Could we match, but just on a much grander scale?": 1,
    " Let's call this scheme print 8.": 1,
    " And here's how it might work.": 1,
    "Provided it saw little inflation risk from doing so, the central bank would be mandated to match the government's overseas aid payments up to a certain limit.": 1,
    " Governments have been aiming to get aid to 0.7% for years, so let's set the limit at half of that.": 1,
    "0.35% of their income.": 1,
    " So it would work like this.": 1,
    "If in a given year the government gave 0.2% of its income to overseas aid, the central bank would simply top it up with a further 0.2%.": 1,
    "So far, so good.": 1,
    " How risky is this?": 1,
    " Well, this involves the creation of money.": 1,
    " to buy goods not assets sounds sounds more inflationary already doesn't it but there are two important mitigating factors here the first": 1,
    " is that by definition this money printed would be spent overseas.": 1,
    " So it's not obvious how it leads to inflation in the country doing the actual printing.": 1,
    " unless it leads to a currency depreciation of that country.": 1,
    "That is unlikely for the second reason.": 1,
    "The scale of the money that would be printed under this scheme.": 1,
    " So let's think of an example where print aid was in place in the US, UK, and Japan.": 1,
    " To match the aid payments made by those governments over the last four years, print aid would have generated $200 billion worth of extra aid.": 1,
    " What would that look like in the context of the increase in the money stock that already happened in those countries to save the financial system?": 1,
    "Are you ready for this?": 1,
    " You might struggle to see that at the back because the gap is quite small.": 1,
    " So what we're saying here...": 1,
    " is that we took a 3.7 trillion dollar gamble to save our financial systems.": 1,
    "And you know what?": 1,
    "It paid off.": 1,
    "There was no inflation.": 1,
    " Are we really saying that it's not worth the risk to print an extra 200 billion for aid?": 1,
    "Would the risks really be that different?": 1,
    "To me it's not that clear.": 1,
    " What is clear is the impact on aid.": 1,
    "Even though this is the printing of just three central banks, the global aid that's given": 1,
    " over this period is up by almost 40%.": 1,
    " Aid as a proportion of national income, all of a sudden, is at a 40-year high.": 1,
    "Now, we don't get to 0.7%.": 1,
    "Governments are still incentivized to give.": 1,
    "But you know, that's the point of a matching scheme.": 1,
    " So I think what we've learned...": 1,
    " is that the risks from this money creation scheme are quite modest.": 1,
    " but the benefits.": 1,
    " are potentially huge.": 1,
    "Imagine what we could do with 40% more funding.": 1,
    " You might be able to feed the front row.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " I fear the only thing that I fear apart from the fact I've run out of time is that the window of opportunity for this idea is": 1,
    " is a short one.": 1,
    " Today, money creation by central banks is an accepted policy tool.": 1,
    " Today, there are universally agreed aims for international aid.": 1,
    " Today might be the only time that these two things coincide, such that we can afford the aid that we've always aspired to give.": 1,
    " So.": 1,
    " Can we print money for international aid?": 1,
    " I seriously believe the question should be.": 1,
    " Okay.": 1
