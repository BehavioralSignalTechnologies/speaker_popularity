    " Ah.": 1,
    " I am a paper cutter.": 1,
    " I cut stories.": 1,
    "So my process is very straightforward.": 1,
    "I take a piece of paper.": 1,
    "I visualize my story.": 1,
    " Sometimes I sketch, sometimes I don't, and as my image is already inside the paper, I just have to remove what's not from that story.": 1,
    " So I didn't come to paper cutting in a straight line.": 1,
    "In fact, I see it more as a spiral.": 1,
    "I was not born with a blade in my hand.": 1,
    " And I don't remember paper cutting as a child.": 1,
    "As a teenager, I was sketching, drawing, and I wanted to be an artist.": 1,
    "But I was also a rebel.": 1,
    " And I left everything and went for a long series of odd jobs.": 1,
    "So among them, I have been a shepherdess, a truck driver, a factory worker,": 1,
    " a cleaning lady.": 1,
    "I worked in tourism for one year in Mexico, one year in Egypt.": 1,
    "I moved for two years in Taiwan.": 1,
    " And then I settled in New York, where I became a tour guide, and I still work as a tour leader, travel back and forth in China, Tibet, and Central Asia.": 1,
    " So of course it took time and I was nearly 40 and I decided it's time to start as an artist.": 1,
    "So I chose...": 1,
    " I chose paper cutting because paper is cheap, it's light, and you can use it in a lot of different ways.": 1,
    "And I chose the language of silhouette.": 1,
    " because graphically it's very efficient and it's also just getting for the essential of things.": 1,
    " So the word silhouette comes from a minister of finance, Etienne de Silouette.": 1,
    "And he slashed so many budgets.": 1,
    " that people say they couldn't afford paintings anymore and they needed to have their portrait a la silhouette.": 1,
    " So, I made a series of images, cutting, and I assembled them in portfolios.": 1,
    " And people told me, like these 36 views of the Empire State Building, they told me you're making artist books.": 1,
    " So artist books have a lot of definition.": 1,
    "They come in a lot of different shapes.": 1,
    "But to me, they are fascinating objects to visually narrate a story.": 1,
    " They can be with words or without words.": 1,
    "And I have a passion for images and for words.": 1,
    " I love pun and the relation to the unconscious.": 1,
    "I love oddities of languages.": 1,
    " And everywhere I lived, I learned the languages but never mastered them.": 1,
    "So I'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in different languages.": 1,
    "So as you can guess, my mother tongue is French.": 1,
    " and my daily language is English.": 1,
    " So I did a series of work where it was identical words in French and in English.": 1,
    "So one of this work is the spelling spider.": 1,
    " So the spelling spider is a cousin of the spelling bee.": 1,
    " But it's much more connected to the web.": 1,
    " And this spider spins a bilingual alphabet.": 1,
    "So you can read architecture active or active architecture.": 1,
    " So this spider goes through the whole alphabet with identical adjectives and substantives.": 1,
    "So if you don't know one of these languages, it's instant learning.": 1,
    " And one ancient form of the book is scrolls.": 1,
    " So scrolls are very convenient because you can create a large image on a very small table.": 1,
    " So the unexpected consequences of that is that you only see one part of your image.": 1,
    " So it makes a very freestyle architecture.": 1,
    "And they're making all those kinds of windows.": 1,
    " So it's to look beyond the surface.": 1,
    "It's to have a look at different worlds, and very often I've been an outsider.": 1,
    "So I want to see how things work and what's happening.": 1,
    " So each window is an image and is a world that I often revisit.": 1,
    "And I revisit this world": 1,
    " Thinking about the image are clich\u00e9 about what we want to do and what are the words, colloquialism that we have with it, the expressions.": 1,
    " It's all if.": 1,
    "So what if we were living in balloon houses?": 1,
    " It would make a very uplifting world.": 1,
    "And we would leave a very low footprint on the planet.": 1,
    "It would be so light.": 1,
    " So sometimes I view from the inside like egocentricity and the inner circles.": 1,
    " Sometimes it's a global view to see our common roots and how we can use them to catch dreams.": 1,
    " and we can use them also as a safety net.": 1,
    " And my inspirations are very eclectic.": 1,
    " I'm influenced by everything I read, everything I see.": 1,
    " I have some stories that are humorous, like dead beats.": 1,
    " Other one, historical.": 1,
    "Here it's candy city.": 1,
    "It's a non-sugar coated history of sugar.": 1,
    " It goes from slave trade to over consumption of sugar with some sweet moments in between.": 1,
    " And sometimes I have emotional response to news, such as the 2010 Haitian earthquake.": 1,
    " At the time, it's not even my stories.": 1,
    "People tell me their life, their memories, their aspiration, and I create a mindscape.": 1,
    " I channel their history for they have a place to go back, to look at their life and its possibilities.": 1,
    "I call them Freudian cities.": 1,
    " I cannot speak for all my images, so I'll just go through a few of my words.": 1,
    " just with a title, modicity.": 1,
    " Electricity.": 1,
    " Matt Gross on Columbus Circle.": 1,
    " Reef City.": 1,
    " a web of time.": 1,
    " Chaos City.": 1,
    " daily battles.": 1,
    " Felicity.": 1,
    " floating islands.": 1,
    " And at one point I had to do the whole nine yards.": 1,
    "So it's actually a paper cut that's nine yard long.": 1,
    " So in life and in paper cutting, everything is connected.": 1,
    "One story leads to another.": 1,
    "I was also interested in the physicality of this format because you have to walk to see it.": 1,
    " And parallel to my cutting is my running.": 1,
    "I started with small image, I started with few miles.": 1,
    "Larger image, I started to run marathon.": 1,
    "Then I went to run 50K, then 60K.": 1,
    " Then I ran 50 miles ultra marathons.": 1,
    "And I still feel I'm running.": 1,
    "It's just a training to become a long distance paper cutter.": 1,
    " And running gives me a lot of energy.": 1,
    "Here it is a three weeks paper cutting marathon at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City.": 1,
    " The result is Hells and Heavens.": 1,
    "It's two panels of 13 feet high.": 1,
    "They were installed in the museum on two floors, but in fact it's a continuous image.": 1,
    " And I call it health and heavens because it's daily health and daily heavens.": 1,
    "There is no border in between.": 1,
    "Some people are born in health.": 1,
    " And against all odds, they make it to Heavens.": 1,
    "Other people make the opposite trip.": 1,
    "That's the border.": 1,
    "You have sweatshops in Hells.": 1,
    "You have people renting the wings in Heavens.": 1,
    " And then you have all those individual stories where sometimes you even have the same action and the result puts you in health or in heaven.": 1,
    " So the whole Health and Heavens is about free will and determinism.": 1,
    " And in paper cutting, you have the drawing is the structure itself.": 1,
    "So you can take it off the wall.": 1,
    " Here, it's an artist book installation called Identity Project.": 1,
    "It's not autobiographical identities.": 1,
    " They are more our social identities.": 1,
    "And then you can just walk behind them and try them on.": 1,
    "So it's like the different layers of what we are made of.": 1,
    " and what we present to the world as an identity.": 1,
    "And that's another artist book project.": 1,
    "In fact, in the picture you have two of them.": 1,
    " It's one I'm wearing and one that's an exhibition at the Center for Book Art in New York City.": 1,
    " Why do I call it a book?": 1,
    "It's called Fashion Statement.": 1,
    "And there is quotes about fashion, so you can read it.": 1,
    "And also, because the definition of artist's book is very generous.": 1,
    " So artist books, you take them off the wall, you take them for a walk, you can also install them as public art.": 1,
    " Here it's in Scottsdale, Arizona, and it's called Floating Memories.": 1,
    "So it's regional memories, and they are just randomly moved by the wind.": 1,
    " I love public art.": 1,
    " and I entered competitions for a long time.": 1,
    "After eight years of rejection, I was thrilled to get my first commission with a person for the art in New York City.": 1,
    " It was for emergency workers and firemen.": 1,
    " I made an artist's book that's in stainless steel instead of paper.": 1,
    "I called it Working in the Same Direction.": 1,
    " but I added weather vane on both sides to show that they cover all directions.": 1,
    " With public art, I could also make cut glass.": 1,
    "Here it's faceted glass in the Bronx.": 1,
    "And each time I make public art, I want something that's really relevant to the place it's installed.": 1,
    " So for the subway in New York, I saw a correspondence between riding the subway and reading.": 1,
    "It is travel in time, travel on time.": 1,
    " And Bronx literature, it's all about Bronx writers and their stories.": 1,
    " Another glass project is in a public library in San Jose, California.": 1,
    "So I made a digital point of view of the growth of San Jose.": 1,
    "So I started in the center": 1,
    " with the corn for the Ohlone Indian civilization.": 1,
    "Then I have the fruit from Europe for the ranchers and then the fruit of the world for Silicon Valley today and it's still growing.": 1,
    " So the technique is cut, sandblasted, etched, and printed glass into architectural glass.": 1,
    " And outside the library, I wanted to make a place to cultivate your mind.": 1,
    " I took library material who had fruit names in their title, and I used them to make an orchard walk with these fruits of knowledge.": 1,
    " I also planted a biblio tree.": 1,
    "So it's a tree and in its trunk you have the roots of languages.": 1,
    "And it's all about international writing systems and on the branches you have": 1,
    " library material growing.": 1,
    " You can also have function and form with public art.": 1,
    "So in Aurora, Colorado, it's a bench, but you have a bonus with this bench.": 1,
    "Because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts, you will walk away with...": 1,
    " Temporarily branding of the story element on your thighs.": 1,
    " Another functional work, it's in the south side of Chicago for a subway station, and it's called Seeds of the Future are Planted Today.": 1,
    " It's a story about transformation and connections.": 1,
    "So it acts as a screen to protect the rail and the commuter, and not to have objects falling on the rails.": 1,
    " To be able to change fences and window guards into flowers, it's fantastic.": 1,
    " And here I've been working for the last three years with the South Bronx developer to bring art to life to low-income buildings and affordable housing.": 1,
    " So each building has its own personality.": 1,
    "And sometimes it's about a legacy of the neighborhood, like in Mauritania, about the jazz history.": 1,
    " And for other projects like in Paris, it's about the name of the street.": 1,
    "It's called Rue des Prairies, Prairies Street.": 1,
    "So I brought back the rabbit, the dragonfly.": 1,
    " to stay in that street.": 1,
    "And in 2009, I was asked to make a poster to be placed in the subway cars in New York City for a year.": 1,
    "So that was a very captive audience.": 1,
    " and I wanted to give them an escape.": 1,
    " I created all around town.": 1,
    " It is a paper cutting, and then after I added color on the computer.": 1,
    "So I can call it techno-crafted.": 1,
    " And along the way, I'm kind of making paper cuttings and adding other techniques.": 1,
    "But the result, it's always to have stories.": 1,
    "So the stories, they have a lot of possibilities.": 1,
    "They have a lot of scenarios.": 1,
    " I don't know the stories.": 1,
    "I take image from our global imagination, from clich\u00e9, from things we are thinking about, from history.": 1,
    "And everybody is a narrator.": 1,
    " because everybody has a story to tell, but more important is everybody has to make a story to make sense of the world.": 1,
    " And in all this universe, it's like imagination is the vehicle to be transported with.": 1,
    "But the destination is our minds.": 1,
    " and how we can reconnect with the essential and with the magic.": 1,
    "And it's all what story cutting is about.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
