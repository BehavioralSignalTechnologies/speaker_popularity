    "Thank you.": 3,
    "Thank you very much.": 2,
    " Thank you.": 2,
    " Now, I'm going to give you a story.": 1,
    "It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey.": 1,
    "Let me begin with my parents.": 1,
    "I'm a product of this visionary mother and father.": 1,
    " Many years ago, when I was born in the 50s, 50s and 60s didn't belong to girls in India.": 1,
    "They belonged to boys.": 1,
    "They belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents.": 1,
    "And girls would be dolled up to get married.": 1,
    " My family in my city and almost in the country was unique.": 1,
    "We were four of us, not one, and fortunately no boys.": 1,
    "We were four girls and no boys.": 1,
    "And my parents were part of a landed property family.": 1,
    " My father defied his own grandfather, almost to the point of disinheritance, because he decided to educate all four of us.": 1,
    " He sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education.": 1,
    "As I've said, when we're born, we don't choose our parents.": 1,
    "And when we go to school, we don't choose our school.": 1,
    "Children don't choose the school.": 1,
    "They just get the school which parents choose for them.": 1,
    " So this is the foundation time which I got.": 1,
    "I grew up like this and so did my other three sisters.": 1,
    "And my father used to say at that time, I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world.": 1,
    "I don't know whether he really meant, but it happened.": 1,
    " I'm the only one who's left in India.": 1,
    "One is a British, another is an American, and the third is a Canadian.": 1,
    "So we are four of us in four corners of the world.": 1,
    " And since I said they're my role models, I followed two things which my father and mother gave me.": 1,
    "One, they said, life is on an incline.": 1,
    "You either go up or you come down.": 1,
    " And second thing which has stayed with me, which became my philosophy of life, which made all the difference, is 100 things happen in your life, good or bad.": 1,
    " Out of hundred, ninety are your creation.": 1,
    "They're good, they're your creation.": 1,
    "Enjoy it.": 1,
    "If they're bad, they're your creation.": 1,
    "Learn from it.": 1,
    "Ten are nature sent over which you can't do a thing.": 1,
    "It's like a death of a relative.": 1,
    " or a cyclone or a hurricane or an earthquake, you can't do a thing about it.": 1,
    "You've got to just respond to the situation.": 1,
    "But that response comes out of those 90 points.": 1,
    "Since I'm a product of this philosophy,": 1,
    " of 90-10.": 1,
    "And secondly, life on an incline.": 1,
    "That's the way I grew up.": 1,
    "I grew up to be valuing what I got.": 1,
    "I'm a product of opportunities.": 1,
    " rare opportunities in the 50s and 60s which girls didn't get.": 1,
    "And I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique because all my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry.": 1,
    " And here I was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities.": 1,
    "I thought I must tell you this.": 1,
    "Why I said this is the background.": 1,
    "This is what comes next.": 1,
    "I joined the Indian Police Service.": 1,
    " as a tough woman, a woman with intrafatigal stamina because I used to run for my tennis titles, etc.": 1,
    "But I joined the Indian Police Service.": 1,
    " And then it was a new pattern of policing.": 1,
    "For me, the policing stood for power to correct, power to prevent, and power to detect.": 1,
    " This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India, the power to prevent.": 1,
    "Because normally it was always said, power to detect, and that's it, or power to punish.": 1,
    "But I decided no.": 1,
    " It's a power to prevent because that's what I learned when I was growing up.": 1,
    "How do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10?": 1,
    "So this is how.": 1,
    " it came into my service and it was different from the men.": 1,
    "I didn't want to make it different from the men, but it was different because this is the way I was different and I redefined policing concepts in India.": 1,
    " I'm going to take you through two journeys, my policing journey and my prison journey.": 1,
    "What you see, if you see the title called PM's car held, this is the first time Prime Minister of India was given a parking ticket.": 1,
    " That's the first time in India, and I can tell you, this is the last time you're hearing about it.": 1,
    "It will never happen again in India because now it was once and forever.": 1,
    "And the rule was because I was sensitive, I was compassionate.": 1,
    " I was very sensitive to injustice, and I was very pro-justice.": 1,
    "That's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service.": 1,
    "I had other options, but I didn't choose them.": 1,
    "So I'm going to move on.": 1,
    "This is about tough policing equal policing.": 1,
    " Now I was known that here's a woman who's not going to listen.": 1,
    "So I was sent to all indescribable postings.": 1,
    "Postings which others would say, no, I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer.": 1,
    "Normally police officers don't want to do prison.": 1,
    " They sent me to prison to lock me up thinking, now there would be no cars and no VIPs to be given tickets to.": 1,
    "Let's lock her up.": 1,
    " Here I got a prison assignment.": 1,
    "This was a prison assignment which is one big den of criminals.": 1,
    "Obviously it was.": 1,
    "But 10,000 men of which only 400 were women.": 1,
    " 10,000, 9,000 plus about 600 were men, terrorists, rapists.": 1,
    " burglars, gangsters, some of them I'd sent to jail as a police officer outside.": 1,
    "And then, how did I deal with them?": 1,
    "The first day when I went in, I didn't know how to look at them.": 1,
    "And I said, do you pray?": 1,
    " When I looked at the group, I said, do you pray?": 1,
    "They saw me as a young, short woman wearing a patan suit.": 1,
    "They said, do you pray?": 1,
    "And they said, yes.": 1,
    " They didn't say anything.": 1,
    "I said, do you pray?": 1,
    "You want to pray?": 1,
    "They said, yes.": 1,
    "I said, all right, let's pray.": 1,
    "I prayed for them, and things started to change.": 1,
    " This is a visual of education inside the prison.": 1,
    "Friends, this has never happened where everybody in the prison studies.": 1,
    "I started this with community support.": 1,
    "Government had no budget.": 1,
    "It was one of the finest, largest voluntarism in any prison in the world.": 1,
    " This was initiated in Delhi prison.": 1,
    "You see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class.": 1,
    "These are hundreds of classes, 9 to 11, every prisoner went into education program.": 1,
    " Same then, which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten.": 1,
    "We converted this into an ashram.": 1,
    "From a prison to an ashram through education.": 1,
    " I think that's the bigger change.": 1,
    "It is the beginning of a change.": 1,
    "Teachers were prisoners.": 1,
    "Teachers were volunteers.": 1,
    "Books came from donated school books.": 1,
    "Stationery was donated.": 1,
    "Everything was donated because there was no budget of education for the prison.": 1,
    " Now, if I had not done that, it would have been a hellhole.": 1,
    "That's the second landmark.": 1,
    "I want to show you some moments of history in my journey.": 1,
    " which probably you'll never ever get to see anywhere in the world.": 1,
    "One, the numbers you'll never get to see.": 1,
    "Secondly, this concept.": 1,
    "This was a meditation program inside the prison of over a thousand prisoners.": 1,
    " 1,000 prisoners who sat in meditation.": 1,
    "This was one of the most courageous step I took as a prison governor, and this is what": 1,
    " transformed.": 1,
    "You want to know more about this, go and see this film, Doing Time, Doing Vipashna.": 1,
    "You'll hear about it and you'll love it.": 1,
    "And write to me on kiranvedi.com and I'll respond to you.": 1,
    " Let me show you the next slide.": 1,
    "I took the same concept of mindfulness, because why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison?": 1,
    "Because crime is a product of distorted mind.": 1,
    " It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control, not by preaching, not by telling, not by reading, but by addressing your mind.": 1,
    "I took the same thing to the police because police equally were prisoners of their mind and they felt as if it is we and they.": 1,
    " and that the people don't cooperate.": 1,
    "This worked.": 1,
    "This is a feedback box called the petition box.": 1,
    "This is a concept which I introduced to listen to complaints, listen to grievances.": 1,
    "This was a magic box.": 1,
    "This was a sensitive box.": 1,
    " This is how a prisoner drew, how they felt about in the prison.": 1,
    "If you see somebody in the blue, yeah, this guy.": 1,
    " He was a prisoner, and he was a teacher, and you see everybody busy.": 1,
    "There was no time to waste.": 1,
    "Let me wrap it up.": 1,
    "I'm currently into movements, movements of education of the underserved children, which is thousands.": 1,
    "India is all about thousands.": 1,
    " Secondly is about anti-corruption movement in India.": 1,
    "That's a big way we as small group of activists have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India.": 1,
    " Friends, you will hear a lot about it.": 1,
    "That's the movement at the moment I'm driving and that's the movement and a mission of my life.": 1
