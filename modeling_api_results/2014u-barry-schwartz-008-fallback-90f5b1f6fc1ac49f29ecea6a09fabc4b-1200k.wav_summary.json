    " Today I'm going to talk about work.": 1,
    " And the question I want to ask and answer is this, why do we work?": 1,
    " Why do we drag ourselves out of bed every morning instead of living our lives just filled with bouncing from one Ted-like adventure to another?": 1,
    "You may be asking yourselves that very question.": 1,
    " Now, I know, of course, we have to make a living.": 1,
    "But nobody in this room thinks that that's the answer to the question, why do we work?": 1,
    "For folks in this room, the work we do is challenging.": 1,
    " It's engaging.": 1,
    "It's stimulating.": 1,
    "It's meaningful.": 1,
    "And if we're lucky, it might even be important.": 1,
    " So we wouldn't work if we didn't get paid, but that's not why we do what we do.": 1,
    "And in general, I think we think that material rewards are a pretty bad reason for doing the work that we do.": 1,
    "When we say of somebody that he's in it for the money,": 1,
    " We are not just being descriptive.": 1,
    " Now I think this is totally obvious, but the very obviousness of it raises what is for me an incredibly profound question.": 1,
    " Why is, this is so obvious, why is it that for the overwhelming majority of people on the planet": 1,
    " The work they do has none of the characteristics that get us up and out of bed and off toward the office every morning.": 1,
    "How is it that we allow the majority of people on the planet to do work?": 1,
    " that is monotonous, meaningless, and soul-deadening.": 1,
    "Why is it that as capitalism developed, it created a mode of production of goods and services?": 1,
    " in which all the non-material satisfactions that might come from work were eliminated.": 1,
    " Workers who do this kind of work, whether they do it in factories, in call centers, or in fulfillment warehouses, do it for pay.": 1,
    " There is certainly no other earthly reason to do what they do except for pay.": 1,
    "So the question is, why?": 1,
    "And here's the answer.": 1,
    " The answer is technology.": 1,
    " Now I know, I know.": 1,
    "Yeah, yeah, yeah.": 1,
    "Technology, automation, screws people, blah, blah.": 1,
    "That's not what I mean.": 1,
    "I'm not talking about the kind of technology that has enveloped our lives and that people come to TED to hear about.": 1,
    " I'm not talking about the technology of things, profound though that is.": 1,
    "I'm talking about another technology.": 1,
    "I'm talking about the technology of ideas.": 1,
    " I call it idea technology.": 1,
    "How clever of me.": 1,
    " In addition to creating things, science creates ideas.": 1,
    "Science creates ways of understanding.": 1,
    " And in the social sciences, the ways of understanding that get created are ways of understanding ourselves.": 1,
    "And they have an enormous influence on how we think, what we aspire to, and how we act.": 1,
    " If you think your poverty is God's will, you pray.": 1,
    "If you think your poverty is the result of your own inadequacy,": 1,
    " You shrink into despair.": 1,
    "And if you think your poverty is the result of oppression and domination, then you rise up in revolt.": 1,
    " Whether your response to poverty is resignation or revolution depends on how you understand the sources of your poverty.": 1,
    "This is the role that ideas play in shaping us.": 1,
    " as human beings, and this is why idea technology may be the most profoundly important technology that science gives us.": 1,
    "And there's something special about idea technology.": 1,
    " that makes it different from the technology of things.": 1,
    "With things, if the technology sucks, it just vanishes.": 1,
    " Right?": 1,
    "Bad technology disappears.": 1,
    "With ideas, false ideas about human beings will not go away if people believe that they're true.": 1,
    " Because if people believe that they're true, they create ways of living and institutions that are consistent with these very false ideas.": 1,
    "And that's how the Industrial Revolution created a factory system in which": 1,
    " There was really nothing you could possibly get out of your day's work except for the pay at the end of the day.": 1,
    "Because the father, one of the fathers of the Industrial Revolution, Adam Smith, was convinced that human beings were by their very natures lazy,": 1,
    " and wouldn't do anything unless you made it worth their while.": 1,
    "And the way you made it worth their while was by incentivizing, by giving them rewards.": 1,
    "That was the only reason anyone ever did anything.": 1,
    " So we created a factory system consistent with that false view of human nature.": 1,
    "But once that system of production was in place, there was really no other way for people to operate except in a way that was consistent with Adam Smith's.": 1,
    " vision.": 1,
    "So the work example is merely an example of how false ideas can create a circumstance that ends up making them true.": 1,
    " It is not true that you just can't get good help anymore.": 1,
    " It is true that you can't get good help anymore when you give people work to do that is demeaning and soulless.": 1,
    " And interestingly enough, Adam Smith, the same guy who gave us this incredible invention of mass production and division of labor, understood this.": 1,
    "He said,": 1,
    " of people who worked in assembly lines, of men who worked in assembly lines, he says he generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become.": 1,
    " Now notice the word here is become.": 1,
    "He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become.": 1,
    " Whether he intended it or not, what Adam Smith was telling us there is that the very shape of the institution within which people work creates people who are fitted": 1,
    " to the demands of that institution and deprives people of the opportunity to derive the kinds of satisfactions from their work that we take for granted.": 1,
    " The thing about natural science is that we can spin fantastic theories about the cosmos and have complete confidence that the cosmos is completely indifferent to our theories.": 1,
    " It's going to work the same damn way no matter what theories we have about the cosmos.": 1,
    "But we do have to worry about the theories we have of human nature because human nature will be changed": 1,
    " by the theories we have that are designed to explain and help us understand human beings.": 1,
    "The distinguished anthropologist Clifford Geertz said years ago that human beings are the unfinished animals.": 1,
    " And what he meant by that was that it is only human nature to have a human nature that is very much the product of the society in which people live.": 1,
    " That human nature, that is to say our human nature, is much more created than it is discovered.": 1,
    "We design human nature by designing the institutions within which people live and work.": 1,
    " And so you people, pretty much the closest I ever get to being with masters of the universe, you people should be asking yourself a question as you go back home to run your organizations.": 1,
    " Just what kind of human nature do you want to help design?": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " Thanks.": 1
