    " So I work in marketing, which I love, but my first passion was physics, a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher when I had a little less grey hair.": 1,
    " So he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us.": 1,
    "And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing.": 1,
    " So, quick show of hands, who studied Sun Marketing at university?": 1,
    " who studied some physics at university.": 1,
    "Ooh, pretty good.": 1,
    "Out of school?": 1,
    "Okay, lots of you.": 1,
    "So hopefully this will bring back some happy or possibly some slightly disturbing memories.": 1,
    "So, physics and marketing.": 1,
    " We'll start with something very simple.": 1,
    "Newton's law.": 1,
    "The force equals mass times acceleration.": 1,
    "This is something that perhaps Turkish airlines should have studied a bit more carefully.": 1,
    " before they ran this campaign.": 1,
    " But if we rearrange this formula quickly, we can get to acceleration equals force over mass, which means that for a larger particle, a larger mass, it requires more force to change its direction.": 1,
    " It's the same with brands.": 1,
    "The more massive a brand, the more baggage it has, the more forces need to change its positioning.": 1,
    " And that's one of the reasons why Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture, rather than try to persuade the world that Andersen's could stand for something other than accountancy.": 1,
    " It explains why Hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners.": 1,
    " and why companies like Unilever and P&G keep brands separate like Ariel and Pringles and Dove rather than having one giant parent brand.": 1,
    " So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object, the more force is needed to change its direction.": 1,
    "The marketing is the bigger a brand, the more difficult it is to reposition it.": 1,
    "So think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures.": 1,
    " Now, who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?": 1,
    "Getting a little more technical now.": 1,
    "So this says that it's impossible by definition to measure exactly the state, i.e.": 1,
    "the position and the momentum of a particle because the act of measuring it": 1,
    " definition changes it.": 1,
    "So to explain that, if you've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it, then the photon of light has momentum which knocks the particle so you don't know where it was before you looked at it.": 1,
    " By measuring it, the act of measurement changes it.": 1,
    "The act of observation changes it.": 1,
    "It's the same in marketing.": 1,
    "So the act of observing consumers changes their behavior.": 1,
    " Think about the group of mums who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group, and almost none of them buy lots of junk food.": 1,
    "And yet, McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year.": 1,
    " Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets, who stuff their trolleys full of fresh green vegetables and fruit.": 1,
    "But don't shop like that any other day.": 1,
    " And if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for Paul on the web, it's very few.": 1,
    "Yet at Google, we know it's the number one search for category.": 1,
    " So luckily, the marketing is getting easier.": 1,
    "Luckily, with now better point of sale tracking, more digital media consumption, you can measure more what consumers actually do rather than what they say they do.": 1,
    " So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle because the observation changes it.": 1,
    " The message for marketing is that try to measure what consumers actually do rather than what they say they'll do or anticipate they'll do.": 1,
    " So next, the scientific method, an axiom of physics of all science, says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation, you can only disprove it.": 1,
    " What this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning and it will strengthen it but it will not conclusively prove it.": 1,
    "And only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water.": 1,
    " So if we take an example, Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the Earth.": 1,
    "It only took one robust observation from Copernicus to blow that idea out of the water.": 1,
    " and there are parallels for marketing.": 1,
    "You can invest for a long time in a brand, but a single contrary observation that positioning will destroy consumer's belief.": 1,
    "Take BP.": 1,
    " They spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand.": 1,
    "But then, one little accident.": 1,
    " Think about Toyota.": 1,
    "It was for a long time revered as the most reliable of cars.": 1,
    "And then they had the big recall incident.": 1,
    " And Tiger Woods, for a long time, the perfect brand ambassador.": 1,
    "Well, you know the story.": 1,
    " So...": 1,
    " So the physics is that you cannot prove a hypothesis, but it's easy to disprove it.": 1,
    "Any hypothesis is shaky.": 1,
    "And the marketing is that no matter": 1,
    " How much you've invested in your brand, one bad week can undermine decades of good work.": 1,
    "So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups that can undermine your brand.": 1,
    " And lastly, to the slightly obscure world of entropy, the second law of thermodynamics.": 1,
    "This says that entropy, which is a measure of the disorder of a system, will always increase.": 1,
    " The same is true of marketing.": 1,
    "If we go back 20 years, that one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand.": 1,
    " But where we are today, things have changed.": 1,
    "You can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the Conservative Party did earlier this year with their election poster.": 1,
    "But then you lose control of it.": 1,
    " With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer, it's impossible to control where it goes.": 1,
    "Your brand starts being dispersed.": 1,
    " It gets more chaotic.": 1,
    " It's out of your control.": 1,
    " I actually saw him speak.": 1,
    "He did a good job.": 1,
    "But while this may be unsettling for marketers, it's actually a good thing.": 1,
    "This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people, more in with the people.": 1,
    " It makes this distribution of energy is a democratizing force which is ultimately good for your brand.": 1,
    "So the lesson from physics is that": 1,
    " Entropy will always increase, it's a fundamental law.": 1,
    "The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed.": 1,
    "You can't fight it, so embrace it and find a way to work with it.": 1,
    " So, to close, my teacher, Mr. Votta, taught me that physics is cool, and hopefully I've convinced you that physics can teach all of us, even in the world of marketing, something special.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
