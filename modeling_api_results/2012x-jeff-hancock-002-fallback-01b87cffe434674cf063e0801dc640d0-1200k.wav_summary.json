    " Let me tell you, it has been a fantastic month for deception.": 1,
    "And I'm not even talking about the American presidential race.": 1,
    " We have a high profile journalist caught for plagiarism.": 1,
    "A young superstar writer whose book involves so many made up quotes that they've pulled it from the shelves.": 1,
    "A New York Times expose on fake book reviews.": 1,
    "It's been fantastic.": 1,
    " Now, of course, not all deception hits the news.": 1,
    " Much of the deception is every day.": 1,
    "In fact, a lot of research shows that we all lie once or twice a day, as Dave suggested.": 1,
    "So it's about 6.30 now.": 1,
    "Suggests that most of us should have lied.": 1,
    "Let's take a look at Winnipeg.": 1,
    "How many of you in the last 24 hours think back": 1,
    " have told a little fib or a big one.": 1,
    "How many have told a little lie out there?": 1,
    "All right, good.": 1,
    "These are all the liars.": 1,
    "Make sure you pay attention to them.": 1,
    " No, that looked good.": 1,
    "It was about two-thirds of you.": 1,
    "The other third didn't lie, or perhaps forgot.": 1,
    "Or you're lying to me about your line, which is very, very devious.": 1,
    "This fits with a lot of the research, which suggests that line is very pervasive.": 1,
    " It's this pervasiveness combined with the centrality to what it means to be a human.": 1,
    "The fact that we can tell the truth or make something up that has fascinated people throughout history.": 1,
    " Here we have Diogenes with his lantern.": 1,
    "Does anybody know what he was looking for?": 1,
    " A single honest man, and he died without finding one back in Greece.": 1,
    "And we have Confucius in the East, who was really concerned with sincerity.": 1,
    "Not only that you walked the walk, or talked the talk, but that you believed in what you were doing.": 1,
    " You believed in your principles.": 1,
    "Now, my first professional encounter with Deception is a little bit later than these guys, a couple thousand years.": 1,
    "I was a customs officer for Canada back in the mid-90s.": 1,
    " Yeah, I was defending Canada's borders.": 1,
    "You may think that's a weapon right there.": 1,
    "In fact, that's a stamp.": 1,
    "I used a stamp to defend Canada's borders.": 1,
    "Very Canadian of me.": 1,
    " I learned a lot about deception while doing my duty here in customs, one of which was that most of what I thought I knew about deception was wrong, and I'll tell you about some of that tonight.": 1,
    " But even since just 1995, 96, the way we communicate has been completely transformed.": 1,
    "We email, we text, we Skype, we Facebook.": 1,
    "It's insane.": 1,
    " Almost every aspect of human communication has been changed.": 1,
    "And of course, that's had an impact on deception.": 1,
    "Let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions we've been tracking and documenting.": 1,
    "They're called the Butler.": 1,
    " the sock puppet, and the Chinese water army.": 1,
    "It sounds a little bit like a weird book, but actually they're all new types of lines.": 1,
    "Let's start with the butlers.": 1,
    " Here's an example of one on my way.": 1,
    "Anybody ever written on my way?": 1,
    "Then you've also lied.": 1,
    " We're never on our way.": 1,
    "We're thinking about going on our way.": 1,
    "Here's another one.": 1,
    "Sorry I didn't respond to you earlier.": 1,
    "My battery was dead.": 1,
    "Your battery wasn't dead.": 1,
    "You weren't in a dead zone.": 1,
    "You just didn't want to respond to that person that time.": 1,
    " Here's the last one, you're talking to somebody and you say, sorry, I got work, gotta go.": 1,
    "But really, you're just bored.": 1,
    "You want to talk to somebody else.": 1,
    " Each of these is about a relationship.": 1,
    "And this is a 24-7 connected world.": 1,
    "Once you get my cell phone number, you can literally be in touch with me 24 hours a day.": 1,
    " And so these lies are being used by people to create a buffer, like the butler used to do between us and the connections to everybody else.": 1,
    "But they're very special.": 1,
    "They use ambiguity that comes from using technology.": 1,
    "You don't know where I am or what I'm doing or who I'm with.": 1,
    " And they're aimed at protecting the relationships.": 1,
    "These aren't just people being jerks.": 1,
    "These are people that are saying, look, I don't want to talk to you now, or I didn't want to talk to you then, but I still care about you.": 1,
    "Our relationship is still important.": 1,
    " Now the sock puppet on the other hand is a totally different animal.": 1,
    "The sock puppet isn't about ambiguity per se, it's about identity.": 1,
    "Let me give you a very recent example as in like last week.": 1,
    " Here's R.J.": 1,
    "Ellery, bestseller author in Britain.": 1,
    "Here's one of his bestselling books.": 1,
    "Here's a reviewer online on Amazon.": 1,
    "My favorite by Nicodemus Jones is Whatever Else It Might Do.": 1,
    " It will touch your soul.": 1,
    "And of course, you might suspect that Nicodemus Jones is RJ Ellery.": 1,
    "He wrote very, very positive reviews about himself.": 1,
    "Surprise, surprise.": 1,
    " Now this sock puppet stuff isn't actually that new.": 1,
    "Walt Whitman also did this back in the day before there was internet technology.": 1,
    " Sock puppet becomes interesting when we get to scale, which is the domain of the Chinese water army.": 1,
    "Chinese water army refers to thousands of people in China.": 1,
    " that are paid small amounts of money to produce content.": 1,
    "It could be reviews.": 1,
    "It could be propaganda.": 1,
    "The government hires these people.": 1,
    "Companies hire them all over the place.": 1,
    "In North America, we call this astroturfing.": 1,
    " And astroturfing is very common now.": 1,
    "There's a lot of concerns about it.": 1,
    "We see this especially with product reviews, book reviews, everything from hotels to whether that toaster is a good toaster or not.": 1,
    " Now, looking at these three reviews, or these three types of deception, you might think, the internet is really making us a deceptive species.": 1,
    "Especially when you think about the astroturfing, where we can see deception brought up to scale.": 1,
    " But actually, what I've been finding is very different from that.": 1,
    " Now, let's put aside the online anonymous sex chat rooms, which I'm sure none of you have been in.": 1,
    "I can assure you there's deception there.": 1,
    "And let's put aside the Nigerian prince who's emailed you about getting the 43 million out of the country.": 1,
    " Let's forget about that guy too.": 1,
    "Let's focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our co-workers and our loved ones.": 1,
    "Those are the conversations that really matter.": 1,
    "What does technology do to deception with those folks?": 1,
    " Here's a couple of studies.": 1,
    "One of the studies we do are called diary studies, in which we ask people to record all of their conversations and all their lives for seven days.": 1,
    " And what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium.": 1,
    "And the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media.": 1,
    " for a loop because we think, well, there's no non-verbal cues,": 1,
    " In contrast, the most lies.": 1,
    "Again and again and again, we see the phone is the device that people lie on the most.": 1,
    "And perhaps because of the butler lie and buggies I was telling you about.": 1,
    "This tends to be very different from what people expect.": 1,
    " What about resumes?": 1,
    "We did a study in which we had people apply for a job, and they could apply for a job either with a traditional paper resume or on LinkedIn.": 1,
    " which is a social networking site like Facebook, but for professionals, involves the same information as a resume.": 1,
    "And what we found, to many people's surprise,": 1,
    " was that those linked in resumes were more honest on the things that mattered to employers, like your responsibilities or your skills in your previous job.": 1,
    " How about Facebook itself?": 1,
    "We always think that, hey, there are these idealized versions.": 1,
    "People are just showing the best things that happen in their lives.": 1,
    "I've thought that many times.": 1,
    "My friends, in no way they can be that cool and have that good of a life.": 1,
    " Well, one study tested this by examining people's personalities.": 1,
    "They had four good friends of a person.": 1,
    " judge their personality.": 1,
    "Then they had strangers, many strangers, judge the person's personality just from Facebook.": 1,
    "And what they found was those judgments of personality were pretty much identical, highly correlated.": 1,
    "Meaning that Facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality.": 1,
    " All right, well, what about online dating?": 1,
    "I mean, that's a pretty deceptive space.": 1,
    "I'm sure you all have friends that have used online dating.": 1,
    "And they would tell you about that guy that had no hair when he came, or the woman that didn't look at all like her photo.": 1,
    " Well, we were really interested in it.": 1,
    "And so what we did is we brought people online daters into the lab.": 1,
    "And then we measured them.": 1,
    "We got their height up against the wall.": 1,
    " We put them on a scale, got their weight.": 1,
    "Ladies love that.": 1,
    "And then we actually got their driver's license to get their age.": 1,
    "And what we found was very, very interesting.": 1,
    " Here's an example of the men and the height.": 1,
    "Along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile.": 1,
    "Along the y-axis, the vertical axis, is how tall they actually were.": 1,
    " Diagonal line is the truth line.": 1,
    "If there are dots on it, they were telling exactly the truth.": 1,
    "As you see, most of the little dots are below the line.": 1,
    " What it means is all the guys were lying about their height.": 1,
    "In fact, they lied about their height about nine-tenths of an inch.": 1,
    "What we say in the lab is, strong rounding up.": 1,
    "You get to five-eighths and one-tenths and boom, five-nine.": 1,
    " But what's really important here is look at all those dots.": 1,
    "They are clustering pretty close to truth.": 1,
    "What we found was 80% of our participants did indeed lie on one of those dimensions, but they always lied by a little bit.": 1,
    " One of the reasons is pretty simple.": 1,
    "If you go to a date, a coffee date, and you're completely different than what you said, game over.": 1,
    "So people lied frequently, but they lied subtly, not too much.": 1,
    "They were constrained.": 1,
    " Well, what explains all these things?": 1,
    "What explains the fact that despite our intuitions, mine included,": 1,
    " A lot of online communication, technologically mediated communication, is more honest than face to face.": 1,
    "That really is strange.": 1,
    "How do we explain this?": 1,
    "Well, to do that, one thing is we can look at the deception detection literature.": 1,
    " It's a very old literature by now.": 1,
    "It's coming up on 50 years.": 1,
    "It's been reviewed many times.": 1,
    "There's been thousands of trials, hundreds of studies.": 1,
    " And there's some really compelling findings.": 1,
    "The first is we're really bad at detecting deception.": 1,
    "Really bad.": 1,
    "54% accuracy on average when you have to tell if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not.": 1,
    " That's really bad.": 1,
    "Why is it so bad?": 1,
    "Well, it has to do with Pinocchio's nose.": 1,
    " If I were to ask you guys, what do you rely on when you're looking at somebody and you want to find out if they're lying?": 1,
    "What cue do you pay attention to?": 1,
    "Most of you would say that one of the cues you look at is the eyes.": 1,
    " The eyes are the wind of the soul.": 1,
    "And you're not alone.": 1,
    "Around the world, almost every culture, one of the top cues is eyes.": 1,
    "But the research over the last 50 years says there's actually no reliable cue to deception.": 1,
    " which blew me away, and it's one of the hard lessons I learned when I was a customs officer.": 1,
    "The eyes do not tell us whether somebody's lying or not.": 1,
    "Some situations, yes, high stakes, maybe their pupils dilate, their pitch goes up, their body movements change a little bit, but not all the time.": 1,
    " Not for everybody.": 1,
    "It's not reliable.": 1,
    " Strange.": 1,
    "The other thing is that just because you can't see me doesn't mean I'm going to lie.": 1,
    "It's common sense, but one important finding is that we lie for a reason.": 1,
    "We lie to protect ourselves, or for our own gain, or for somebody else's gain.": 1,
    " So there are some pathological eyes, but they make up a tiny portion of the population.": 1,
    "We lie for a reason.": 1,
    "Just because people can't see us doesn't mean we're going to necessarily lie.": 1,
    " But I think there's actually something much more interesting and fundamental going on here.": 1,
    "The next big thing for me, the next big idea, we can find by going way back in history to the origins of language.": 1,
    "Most linguists agree that": 1,
    " We started speaking somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago.": 1,
    "That's a long time ago.": 1,
    "A lot of humans have lived since then.": 1,
    "We've been talking, I guess, about fires and caves and...": 1,
    " Sabre-toothed tigers.": 1,
    "I don't know what they talked about, but they were doing a lot of talking.": 1,
    "And like I said, there's a lot of humans evolving speaking.": 1,
    "About 100 billion people, in fact.": 1,
    "What's important, though, is that writing only emerged about 5,000 years ago.": 1,
    " So what that means is that all the people before there was any writing.": 1,
    " Every word that they ever said, every utterance, disappeared.": 1,
    "No trace, evanescent, gone.": 1,
    " So we've been evolving to talk in a way in which there is no record.": 1,
    " In fact, even the next big change to writing was only 500 years ago now with the printing press, which is very recent in our past.": 1,
    "And literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until World War II.": 1,
    " So even the people of the last two millennia, most of the words they ever said": 1,
    " disappeared.": 1,
    "Let's turn to now, the network age.": 1,
    "How many of you have recorded something today?": 1,
    "Anybody do any writing today?": 1,
    "Did anybody write a word?": 1,
    " It looks like almost every single person here recorded something.": 1,
    "In this room right now, we've probably recorded more than almost all of human pre-ancient history.": 1,
    " That is crazy.": 1,
    "We're entering this amazing period of flux in human evolution, where we've evolved to speak in a way in which our words disappear.": 1,
    " But we're in an environment where we're recording everything.": 1,
    "In fact, I think in the very near future, it's not just what we write that will be recorded.": 1,
    "Everything we do will be recorded.": 1,
    " What does that mean?": 1,
    "What's the next big idea from that?": 1,
    "Well, as a social scientist, this is the most amazing thing I have ever even dreamed of.": 1,
    " Now I can look at all those words that used to, for millennia, disappear.": 1,
    "I can look at lies that before were said and then gone.": 1,
    " Remember those AstroTurfing reviews that we were talking about before?": 1,
    "Well, when they write a fake review, they have to post it somewhere and it's left behind for us.": 1,
    " So one thing that we did, I'll give you an example of looking at the language, is we paid people to write some fake reviews.": 1,
    "One of these reviews is fake.": 1,
    "The person never was at the James Hotel.": 1,
    "The other review is real.": 1,
    "The person stayed there.": 1,
    " Now your task now is to decide.": 1,
    " Which review is fake?": 1,
    " I'll give you a moment to read through them.": 1,
    " But I want everybody to raise their hand at some point.": 1,
    "Remember, I study deception.": 1,
    "I can tell if you don't raise your hand.": 1,
    " All right, how many of you believe that A is the fake?": 1,
    " All right, very good, about half.": 1,
    "And how many of you think that B is?": 1,
    " All right, slightly more for B. Excellent.": 1,
    "Here's the answer.": 1,
    " B is a fake.": 1,
    "Well done second group.": 1,
    "You dominated the first group.": 1,
    " You're actually a little bit unusual.": 1,
    "Every time we demonstrate this, it's usually about a 50-50 split, which fits with the research 54%.": 1,
    "Maybe people here in Winnipeg are more suspicious and better at figuring it out.": 1,
    "It's cold, hard winters.": 1,
    "I love it.": 1,
    " All right, so why do I care about this?": 1,
    "Well, what I can do now with my colleagues in computer science is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception.": 1,
    " Let me highlight a couple of things here in the fake review.": 1,
    "The first is that liars tend to think about narrative.": 1,
    "They make up a story, who and what happened.": 1,
    "And that's what happened here.": 1,
    "Our fake reviewers talked about who they were with and what they were doing.": 1,
    " They also used the first person singular, I, way more than the people that actually stayed there.": 1,
    "They were inserting themselves into the": 1,
    " a hotel review, kind of trying to convince you were there.": 1,
    "In contrast, the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there, their bodies actually entered the physical space, they talked a lot more about spatial information.": 1,
    " They said how big the bathroom was or they said, you know, here's how far shopping is from the hotel.": 1,
    " Now, you guys did pretty well.": 1,
    "Most people perform at chance at this task.": 1,
    "Our computer algorithm is very accurate, much more accurate than humans can be.": 1,
    "And it's not going to be accurate all the time.": 1,
    "This isn't a deception detection machine to tell if your girlfriend's lying to you on text messaging.": 1,
    " We believe that every lie now, every type of lie, fake hotel reviews, fake shoe reviews...": 1,
    " Girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging.": 1,
    "Those are all different lies.": 1,
    "They're going to have different patterns of language.": 1,
    "But because everything is recorded now, we can look at all of those kinds of lies.": 1,
    " Now, as I said, as a social scientist, this is wonderful.": 1,
    "It's transformational.": 1,
    "We're going to be able to learn so much more about human thought and expression, about everything from love to attitudes.": 1,
    " because everything is being recorded now.": 1,
    "But what does it mean for the average citizen?": 1,
    "What does it mean for us in our lives?": 1,
    " Let's forget deception for a bit.": 1,
    "One of the big ideas, I believe, is that we're leaving these huge traces behind.": 1,
    "My inbox and outbox for email is massive, and I never look at it.": 1,
    " I write all the time, but I never look at my record, at my trace.": 1,
    "And I think we're going to see a lot more of that where we can reflect on who we are by looking at what we wrote, what we said, what we did.": 1,
    " Now if we bring it back to deception, there's a couple of takeaway things here.": 1,
    "First,": 1,
    " Lying online can be very dangerous.": 1,
    "Not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine, but you're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to.": 1,
    " And you're also leaving them around for me to analyze with some computer algorithms.": 1,
    "So by all means, go ahead and do that.": 1,
    "That's good.": 1,
    " But when it comes to lying and what we want to do with our lives, I think we can go back to": 1,
    " Diogenes and Confucius and they were less concerned about whether to lie or not to lie and more concerned about being true to the self And I think this is really important": 1,
    " Now, when you are about to say or do something, we can think, do I want this to be part of my legacy, part of my personal record?": 1,
    "Because in the digital age we live in now, in the network age,": 1,
    " We're all leaving a record.": 1,
    " Thank you so much for your time and good luck with your record.": 1
