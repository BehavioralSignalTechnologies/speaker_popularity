    "My idea?": 2,
    " Thank you.": 2,
    " I am a neuroscientist with a mixed background in physics and medicine.": 1,
    "My lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology focuses on spinal cord injury.": 1,
    " which affects more than 50,000 people around the world every year, with dramatic consequences for affected individuals whose lives literally shatter in a matter of a handful of seconds.": 1,
    " And for me, the man of steel, Christopher Reeve, has best raised the awareness on the distress of spinal cord injured people.": 1,
    " And this is how I started my own personal journey in this field of research, working with the Christopher and Dan Ari foundation.": 1,
    " I still remember this.": 1,
    " decisive moment.": 1,
    "It was just at the end of a regular day of work with the foundation.": 1,
    "Chris addressed to us, the scientist, and exposed, you have to be more pragmatic.": 1,
    " When leaving your laboratory tomorrow, I want you to stop by the rehabilitation center to watch injured people fighting to take a step, struggling to maintain their trunk.": 1,
    " And when you go home, think of what you are going to change in your research on the following day to make their life better.": 1,
    " These words, they stuck with me.": 1,
    " This was more than 10 years ago, but ever since, my laboratory has followed the pragmatic approach to recovery after spinal cord injury.": 1,
    " And my first step in this direction was to develop a new model of spinal cord injury that would more closely mimic some of the key features of human injury while offering well-controlled experimental conditions.": 1,
    " And for this purpose, we place two hemisections on opposite sides of the body.": 1,
    "They completely interrupt the communication between the brain and the spinal cord, thus leading to complete and permanent paralysis of the leg.": 1,
    " But as observed, after most injuries in humans, there is this intervening gap of intact neural tissue through which recovery can occur.": 1,
    "But how to make it happen?": 1,
    " Well, the classical approach consists of applying interventions that will promote the growth of the severed fiber to the original target.": 1,
    "And while this certainly remains the key for a cure,": 1,
    " This seemed extraordinarily complicated to me.": 1,
    "To reach clinical fruition rapidly, it was obvious.": 1,
    "I had to think about the problem differently.": 1,
    " It turned out that more than 100 years of research in spinal cord physiology, starting with the Nobel Prize, Sherrington, has shown that": 1,
    " The spinal cord, below most injury, contains all the necessary and sufficient neural network to coordinate locomotion.": 1,
    " But because input from the brain are interrupted, they are in a non-functional state, like kind of dormant.": 1,
    "We awaken this network.": 1,
    " And at the time I was a postdoctoral fellow in Los Angeles after completing my PhD in France where independent thinking is not necessarily promoted.": 1,
    " I was afraid to talk to my new boss, but decided to muster up my courage.": 1,
    "I knocked at the door of my wonderful advisor, Reggie Edgerton, to share my new ID.": 1,
    " He listened to me carefully and responded with a grin.": 1,
    "Why don't you try?": 1,
    " And I promise to you, this was such an important moment in my career when I realized that a great leader believes in young people and new ideas.": 1,
    " And this was the idea.": 1,
    "I'm going to use a simplistic metaphor to explain you this complicated concept.": 1,
    "Imagine that the locomotive system is a car.": 1,
    " The engine is a spinal cord.": 1,
    "The transmission is interrupted.": 1,
    "The engine is turned off.": 1,
    "How could we re-engage the engine?": 1,
    " First, we have to provide the fuel.": 1,
    "Second, press the accelerator pedal.": 1,
    "Third, steer the car.": 1,
    " It turned out that there are neural pathways coming from the brain that play this very function during locomotion.": 1,
    "Replace this missing input.": 1,
    " provide the spinal cord with the kind of intervention that the brain would deliver naturally in order to walk.": 1,
    " For this, I leverage 20 years of past research in neuroscience.": 1,
    "First, to replace the missing fuel with pharmacological agents that prepare the neuron in the spinal cord to fire.": 1,
    " and second to mimic the accelerator pedal with electrical stimulation.": 1,
    "So here imagine an electrode implanted on the back of the spinal cord to deliver painless stimulation.": 1,
    " took many years, but eventually we developed an electrochemical neuroprosthesis that transformed the neuronal network in the spinal cord from dormant to highly functional state.": 1,
    " Immediately, the paralyzed rat can stand.": 1,
    " As soon as the 12,000 bells start moving, the animals show coordinated movement of the leg.": 1,
    " but without the brain.": 1,
    "Here what I call the spinal brain cognitively processes sensory information arising from the moving leg and takes decisions as to how to activate the muscle in order to stand, to walk,": 1,
    " to run, and even here, while sprinting, instantly stand, his treadmill belt stopped moving.": 1,
    "This was amazing.": 1,
    "I was completely fascinated by this locomotion without the brain.": 1,
    " but at the same time so frustrated.": 1,
    " This locomotion was completely involuntary.": 1,
    "The animal had virtually no control over the legs.": 1,
    "Clearly, the steering system was missing.": 1,
    " And it then became obvious to me that we had to move away from the classical rehabilitation paradigm, stepping on a treadmill, and develop conditions that would encourage the brain to regain a voluntary control over the leg.": 1,
    " With this in mind, we develop a completely new robotic system to support the rat in any direction of space.": 1,
    "Imagine, this is really cool.": 1,
    " So you imagine the little 200 gram rat attached at the extremity of this 200 kilo robot, but the rat does not feel the robot.": 1,
    "The robot is transparent.": 1,
    " just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure steps.": 1,
    "Let me summarize.": 1,
    "The rat received a paralysing lesion of the spiral cord.": 1,
    " The electrochemical neuroprosthesis enables highly functional state of the spinal locomotor networks.": 1,
    "The robot provides a safe environment to allow the rat to attend anything to engage the paralyzed legs.": 1,
    " And for motivation, we use what I think is the more powerful pharmacology of Switzerland.": 1,
    "Fine Swiss chocolate.": 1,
    " Actually, the first results were very, very disappointing.": 1,
    " He is my best physical therapist.": 1,
    " Come on, come here sweetie, come on.": 1,
    "Push forward, come on sweetie, come.": 1,
    " completely failing to encourage the rat to take a single step, whereas the same rat, five minutes earlier, walked beautifully on the treadmill.": 1,
    "We were so frustrated.": 1,
    " But you know, one of the most essential qualities of a scientist is perseverance.": 1,
    "We insisted we refine our paradigm, and after several months of training, the otherwise paralyzed rat could stand.": 1,
    " whenever she decided, initiated full weight building locomotion to sprint toward the rewards.": 1,
    " This is the first recovery ever observed of voluntary leg movement after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord leading to complete and permanent paralysis.": 1,
    "In fact,": 1,
    " In fact, not only the rat could initiate and sustain locomotion over ground, they could even adjust leg movement, for example, to resist gravity in order to climb a staircase.": 1,
    " I can promise you this was such an emotional moment in my laboratory.": 1,
    "It took us 10 years of hard work to reach this goal.": 1,
    " But the remaining question was, how?": 1,
    "I mean, how is it possible?": 1,
    "And here what we found was completely unexpected.": 1,
    " This novel training paradigm encourages the brain to create new connections, some relay circuits.": 1,
    " that relay information from the brain past the injury and restore cortical control over the locomotor networks below the injury.": 1,
    " And here you can see one such example, where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red.": 1,
    "This blue neuron is connected with locomotor center.": 1,
    " And what this constellation of synaptic contacts means is that the brain is reconnected with locomotor center with only one relay neuron.": 1,
    " But the remodeling was not restricted to the lesion area.": 1,
    "It occurred throughout the central nervous system, including in the brain stem, where we observed up to 300% increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain.": 1,
    " We did not aim to repair the spinal cord.": 1,
    " Yet, we were able to promote one of the more extensive remodeling of axonal projection ever observed in the central nervous system of adult mammals after an injury.": 1,
    " And you know what this is?": 1,
    " a very important message hidden behind this discovery.": 1,
    " They are the result of a young team of very talented people, physical therapists, neurobiologists, neurosurgeons, engineers of all kinds, who have achieved together": 1,
    " what would have been impossible by single individuals.": 1,
    "This is truly a transdisciplinary theme.": 1,
    "They are working so close to each other that there is horizontal transfer of DNA.": 1,
    " We are creating the next generation of MDs and engineers capable of translating discoveries all the way from bench to bedside.": 1,
    "And me?": 1,
    " I am only the maestro who orchestrates this beautiful symphony.": 1,
    "No, I am sure.": 1,
    " You're all wondering, aren't you?": 1,
    " Will this help injured people?": 1,
    " Me too, every day.": 1,
    " The truth is that we don't know enough yet.": 1,
    "This is certainly not a cure for spinal cord injury.": 1,
    "But I begin to believe that this may lead to an intervention to improve recovery and people's quality of life.": 1,
    " I would like you all.": 1,
    " to take a moment and dream with me.": 1,
    " Imagine a person just suffered spinal cord injury.": 1,
    " After a few weeks of recovery, we will implant a programmable pump to deliver a personalized pharmacological cocktail directly to the spinal cord.": 1,
    " At the same time, we will implant an electrode array, a sort of second skin covering the area of the spinal cord controlling leg movements.": 1,
    " And this array is attached to an electrical pulse generator that delivers stimulation that are tailored to the person's needs.": 1,
    "This defines a personalized electrochemical neuroprosthesis that will enable locomotion": 1,
    " during training with a newly designed supporting system.": 1,
    "And my hope is that after several months of training, there may be enough remodeling or residual connection to allow locomotion without the robot.": 1,
    " maybe even without pharmacology or stimulation.": 1,
    "My hope here is to be able to create the personalized condition": 1,
    " and boost the plasticity of the brain and the spinal cord.": 1,
    "And this is a radically new concept that may apply to other neurological disorders.": 1,
    " what I termed personalized neuroprosthetics, whereby sensing and stimulating neural interfaces are implanted throughout the nervous system.": 1,
    " in the brain, in the spinal cord, even in peripheral nerves, based on patient-specific impairment.": 1,
    "But not to replace the loss function.": 1,
    "No.": 1,
    " to help the brain help itself.": 1,
    "And I hope this enticed your imagination, because I can promise to you, this is not a matter of whether this revolution will occur, but when.": 1,
    " And remember, we are only as great as our imagination, as big as our dream.": 1
