    " You should be nice to nerds.": 1,
    " In fact, I'd go so far as to say if you don't already have a nerd in your life, you should get one.": 1,
    " I'm just saying.": 1,
    " Scientists and engineers change the world.": 1,
    " I'd like to tell you about a magical place called DARPA, where scientists and engineers defy the impossible and refuse to fear failure.": 1,
    " Now these two ideas are connected more than you may realize, because when you remove the fear of failure, impossible things suddenly become possible.": 1,
    " If you want to know how, ask yourself this question.": 1,
    " What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?": 1,
    " If you really ask yourself this question, you can't help but feel uncomfortable.": 1,
    "I feel a little uncomfortable.": 1,
    " Because when you ask it, you begin to understand how the fear of failure constrains you, how it keeps us from attempting great things.": 1,
    "And life gets dull.": 1,
    " Amazing things stop happening.": 1,
    "Sure, good things happen.": 1,
    "But amazing things stop happening.": 1,
    "Now, I should be clear.": 1,
    "I'm not encouraging failure.": 1,
    " I'm discouraging fear of failure.": 1,
    " Because it's not failure itself that constrains us.": 1,
    "The path to truly new, never been done before things always has failure along the way.": 1,
    "We're tested.": 1,
    " And in part, that testing feels an appropriate part of achieving something great.": 1,
    "Clemenceau said, life gets interesting when we fail.": 1,
    " because it's a sign that we've surpassed ourselves.": 1,
    "In 1895, Lord Kelvin declared that heavier than air flying machines were impossible.": 1,
    " In October of 1903, the prevailing opinion of expert aerodynamicists was that maybe in 10 million years we could build an aircraft that would fly.": 1,
    " And two months later on December 17th, Orville Wright powered the first airplane across a beach in North Carolina.": 1,
    "The flight lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 feet.": 1,
    " That was 1903.": 1,
    "One year later, the next declarations of impossibilities began.": 1,
    "Ferdinand Foch, a French army general.": 1,
    " credited with having one of the most original and subtle minds in the French army said, airplanes are interesting toys, but of no military value.": 1,
    " Forty years later, aero experts coined the term transonic.": 1,
    "They debated, should it have one S or two?": 1,
    " You see, they were having trouble in this flight regime, and it wasn't at all clear that we could fly faster than the speed of sound.": 1,
    " In 1947, there was no wind tunnel data beyond Mach 0.85.": 1,
    " And yet, on Tuesday, October 14th, 1947,": 1,
    " Chuck Gager climbed into the cockpit of his Bell X-1 and he flew towards an unknown possibility.": 1,
    " And in so doing, he became the first pilot to fly faster than the speed of sound.": 1,
    " Six of eight Atlas rockets blew up on the pad.": 1,
    "After 11 complete mission failures, we got our first images from space.": 1,
    "And on that first flight, we got more data than in all U-2 missions combined.": 1,
    " you": 1,
    " It took a lot of failures to get there.": 1,
    " Since we took to the sky, we have wanted to fly faster and farther.": 1,
    "And to do so, we've had to believe in impossible things.": 1,
    " and we've had to refuse to fear failure.": 1,
    " That's still true today.": 1,
    "Today, we don't talk about flying transsonically or even supersonically.": 1,
    "We talk about flying hypersonically.": 1,
    " not Mach 2 or Mach 3, Mach 20.": 1,
    "At Mach 20, we can fly from New York to Long Beach in 11 minutes and 20 seconds.": 1,
    " At that speed, the surface of the airfoil is the temperature of molten steel, 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit, like a blast furnace.": 1,
    "We are essentially burning the airfoil as we fly it.": 1,
    " And we are flying it, or trying to.": 1,
    "DARPA's hypersonic test vehicle is the fastest maneuvering aircraft ever built.": 1,
    " boosted to near space atop a Minotaur 4 rocket.": 1,
    "Now the Minotaur 4 has too much impulse, so we have to bleed it off by flying the rocket at an 89 degree angle of attack for portions of the trajectory.": 1,
    " That's an unnatural act for a rocket.": 1,
    " The third stage has a camera.": 1,
    "We call it rocket cam.": 1,
    "And it's pointed at the hypersonic glider.": 1,
    " This is the actual rocket cam footage from flight one.": 1,
    " Now, to conceal the shape, we change the aspect ratio a little bit.": 1,
    "But this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket, looking at the unmanned glider as it heads into the atmosphere back towards Earth.": 1,
    " We've flown twice.": 1,
    "In the first flight, no aerodynamic control of the vehicle.": 1,
    "But we collected more hypersonic flight data than in 30 years of ground-based testing combined.": 1,
    " And in the second flight,": 1,
    " three minutes of fully controlled aerodynamic flight at Mach 20.": 1,
    " We must fly again because amazing, never been done before things require that you fly.": 1,
    " You can't learn to fly at Mach 20 unless you fly.": 1,
    " And while there's no substitute for speed, maneuverability is a very close second.": 1,
    "If a Mach 20 glider takes 11 minutes and 20 seconds to get from New York to Long Beach, a hummingbird would take, well,": 1,
    " days.": 1,
    "You see, hummingbirds are not hypersonic, but they are maneuverable.": 1,
    " In fact, the hummingbird is the only bird that can fly backwards.": 1,
    "It can fly up, down, forwards, backwards, even upside down.": 1,
    " And so if we wanted to fly in this room or places where humans can't go, we'd need an aircraft small enough and maneuverable enough to do so.": 1,
    " This is a hummingbird drone.": 1,
    " It can fly in all directions, even backwards.": 1,
    "It can hover and rotate.": 1,
    "This prototype aircraft is equipped with a video camera.": 1,
    "It weighs less than one AA battery.": 1,
    " It does not eat nectar.": 1,
    " In 2008, it flew for a whopping 20 seconds.": 1,
    "A year later, two minutes, then six, eventually 11.": 1,
    "Many prototypes crashed.": 1,
    "Many.": 1,
    " But there's no way to learn to fly like a hummingbird unless you fly.": 1,
    " It's beautiful, isn't it?": 1,
    " Wow.": 1,
    " It's great.": 1,
    " Matt is the first ever hummingbird pilot.": 1,
    " Failure is part of creating new and amazing things.": 1,
    "We cannot both fear failure and make amazing new things.": 1,
    " like a robot with the stability of a dog on rough terrain or maybe even ice.": 1,
    "A robot that can run like a cheetah or climb stairs like a human.": 1,
    " with the occasional clumsiness of a human.": 1,
    " or perhaps Spider-Man will one day be Gekko Man.": 1,
    " A gecko can support its entire body weight with one toe.": 1,
    "One square millimeter of a gecko's foot pad has 14,000 hair-like structures called setae.": 1,
    " They are used to help it grip to surfaces using intermolecular forces.": 1,
    " Today we can manufacture structures that mimic the hairs of a gecko's foot.": 1,
    "The result?": 1,
    "A four by four inch artificial nano gecko adhesive.": 1,
    " can support a static load of 660 pounds.": 1,
    "That's enough to stick six 42-inch plasma TVs to your wall.": 1,
    "No nails.": 1,
    " So much for Velcro, right?": 1,
    " And it's not just passive structures.": 1,
    "It's entire machines.": 1,
    "This is a spider mite.": 1,
    "It's one millimeter long, but it looks like Godzilla next to these micro machines.": 1,
    " In the world of Godzilla spider mites, we can make millions of mirrors, each one fifth the diameter of a human hair, moving at hundreds of thousands of times per second.": 1,
    " to make large screen displays so that we can watch movies like Godzilla in high def.": 1,
    " And if we can build machines at that scale, what about Eiffel Tower-like trusses at the microscale?": 1,
    " Today we are making metals that are lighter than styrofoam, so light they can sit atop a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air.": 1,
    " so light that you can make a car that two people can lift, but so strong that it has the crash worthiness of an SUV.": 1,
    " From the smallest wisp of air to the powerful forces of nature's storms, there are 44 lightning strikes per second around the globe.": 1,
    " Each lightning bolt heats the air to 44,000 degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than the surface of the sun.": 1,
    " What if we could use these electromagnetic pulses as beacons?": 1,
    "Beacons in a moving network of powerful transmitters.": 1,
    " Experiments suggest that lightning could be the next GPS.": 1,
    " Electrical pulses form the thoughts in our brains.": 1,
    "Using a grid the size of your thumb with 32 electrodes on the surface of his brain,": 1,
    " Tim uses his thoughts to control an advanced prosthetic arm.": 1,
    " and his thoughts made him reach for Katie.": 1,
    "This is the first time a human has controlled a robot with thought alone.": 1,
    " And it is the first time that Tim has held Katie's hand in seven years.": 1,
    "That moment mattered to Tim and Katie.": 1,
    "And this green goo may someday matter to you.": 1,
    " This green goo is perhaps the vaccine that could save your life.": 1,
    "It was made in tobacco plants.": 1,
    " Tobacco plants can make millions of doses of vaccine in weeks instead of months.": 1,
    "And it might just be the first healthy use of tobacco ever.": 1,
    " And if it seems far-fetched that tobacco plants could make people healthy, what about gamers that could solve problems that experts can't solve?": 1,
    "Last September, the gamers of Foldit": 1,
    " solve the three-dimensional structure of the retroviral protease that contributes to AIDS in rhesus monkeys.": 1,
    "Now, understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments.": 1,
    " For 15 years, it was unsolved in the scientific community.": 1,
    "The gamers of Foldit solved it in 15 days.": 1,
    " Now, they were able to do so by working together.": 1,
    "They were able to work together because they're connected by the internet.": 1,
    "And others, also connected to the internet, used it as an instrument of democracy.": 1,
    " And together, they changed the fate of their nation.": 1,
    " The internet is home to 2 billion people or 30% of the world's population.": 1,
    "It allows us to contribute and to be heard as individuals.": 1,
    " It allows us to amplify our voices and our power as a group.": 1,
    " But it, too, had humble beginnings.": 1,
    "In 1969, the internet was but a dream, a few sketches on a piece of paper.": 1,
    " And then on October 29th, the first packet switched message was sent from UCLA to SRI.": 1,
    "The first two letters of the word log in.": 1,
    " That's all that made it through, an L and an O, and then a buffer overflow crashed the system.": 1,
    " Two letters, an L and an O. Now, a worldwide force.": 1,
    " So who are these scientists and engineers at a magical place called DARPA?": 1,
    " They are nerds.": 1,
    " and they are heroes among us.": 1,
    " They challenge existing perspectives at the edges of science and under the most demanding of conditions.": 1,
    " They remind us that we can change the world if we defy the impossible and we refuse to fear failure.": 1,
    " They remind us that we all have nerd power.": 1,
    "Sometimes we just forget.": 1,
    " You see, there was a time when you weren't afraid of failure.": 1,
    "When you were a great artist or a great dancer and you could sing, you were good at math.": 1,
    " You could build things.": 1,
    "You were an astronaut, an adventurer, Jacques Cousteau.": 1,
    "You could jump higher, run faster, kick harder than anyone.": 1,
    "You believed in impossible things and you were fearless.": 1,
    " You were totally and completely in touch with your inner superhero.": 1,
    " Scientists and engineers can indeed change the world.": 1,
    " So can you, you were born to.": 1,
    " So go ahead, ask yourself, what would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?": 1,
    " Now I want to say this is not easy.": 1,
    "It's hard to hold on to this feeling.": 1,
    "Really hard.": 1,
    "I guess in some way I sort of believe it's supposed to be hard.": 1,
    " Doubt and fear always creep in.": 1,
    "We think someone else, someone smarter than us, someone more capable, someone with more resources will solve that problem.": 1,
    "But there isn't anyone else.": 1,
    " There's just you.": 1,
    " And if we're lucky, in that moment, someone steps into that doubt and fear, takes a hand, and says, let me help you believe.": 1,
    " Jason Harley did that for me.": 1,
    "Jason started at DARPA on March 18, 2010.": 1,
    "He was with our transportation team.": 1,
    " I saw Jason nearly every day, sometimes twice a day, and more so than most, he saw the highs and the lows, the celebrations and the disappointments.": 1,
    " And on one particularly dark day for me, Jason sat down and he wrote an email.": 1,
    "He was encouraging but firm.": 1,
    " And when he hit send, he probably didn't realize what a difference it would make.": 1,
    "It mattered to me in that moment.": 1,
    " And still today, when I doubt, when I feel afraid, when I need to reconnect with that feeling,": 1,
    " I remember his words.": 1,
    "They were so powerful.": 1,
    " Because that's what being a superhero is all about.": 1,
    " There is only time enough to iron your cape and back to the skies for you.": 1,
    " And remember, be nice to nerds.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1,
    " Regina, thank you.": 1,
    "I have a couple of questions.": 1,
    "So that glider of yours, the Mark 20 glider, the first one, no control, it ended up in the Pacific, I think.": 1,
    "What happened on that second flight?": 1,
    "Yeah, it also went in the Pacific.": 1,
    " But this time under control?": 1,
    "No, we didn't fly it into the Pacific, right?": 1,
    "No, there are multiple portions of the trajectory that are demanding": 1,
    " in terms of really flying at that speed.": 1,
    "And so in the second flight, we were able to get three minutes of fully aerodynamic control of the vehicle before we lost it.": 1,
    " I imagine you're not planning to open up to passenger service from New York to Long Beach.": 1,
    "No, it might be a little warm.": 1,
    "What do you picture that glider being used for?": 1,
    " Well, our responsibility is to develop the technology for this.": 1,
    "How it's ultimately used will be determined by the military.": 1,
    " The purpose of the vehicle though, the purpose of the technology is to be able to reach anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes.": 1,
    "And to carry a payload of more than a few pounds?": 1,
    "Yeah.": 1,
    "What's the payload it could carry?": 1,
    " Well, I don't think we ultimately know what it will be, right?": 1,
    "We gotta fly it first.": 1,
    "But not necessarily just a camera.": 1,
    "Yeah, no, not necessarily just a camera.": 1,
    " It's amazing.": 1,
    "The hummingbird.": 1,
    " I'm curious, you started your beautiful sequence on flight with a wing, a plane trying to flap its wings and failing horribly.": 1,
    "There haven't been that many planes built since that flap wings.": 1,
    " Why did we think that this was the time to go biomimicry and copy a hummingbird?": 1,
    "Isn't that a very expensive solution for a small, maneuverable, flying object?": 1,
    " So, I mean, in part, we wondered if it was possible to do it, and you have to revisit these questions over time.": 1,
    "The folks at AeroVironment tried 300": 1,
    " or more different wing designs, 12 different forms of the avionics, took them 10 full prototypes to get something that would actually fly.": 1,
    "But there's something really interesting about": 1,
    " a flying machine that looks like something you'd recognize.": 1,
    "So we often talk about stealth as a means for avoiding any type of sensing, but when things look just natural, you also don't see them.": 1,
    " It's like mini stealth.": 1,
    "It's partly the look.": 1,
    "Look at that cute hummingbird flying into my headquarters.": 1,
    " Because that's, I think, as well as the awe at looking at that.": 1,
    "I'm sure some people here are thinking, you know, technology catches up so quick.": 1,
    "How long is it before some crazed geek with a little remote control flies through a window of the White House?": 1,
    " I mean, do you worry about the Pandora's box issue here?": 1,
    "Well, look...": 1,
    " Our singular mission is the creation and prevention of strategic surprise.": 1,
    "That's what we do.": 1,
    "It would be inconceivable for us to do that work": 1,
    " if we didn't make people excited and uncomfortable with the things that we do at the same time.": 1,
    "It's just the nature of what we do.": 1,
    "Now, our responsibility is to push that edge and": 1,
    " And we have to be, of course, mindful and responsible of how the technology is developed and ultimately used.": 1,
    "But we can't simply close our eyes and pretend that it isn't advancing.": 1,
    "It's advancing.": 1,
    " I mean you're clearly a really inspiring leader and you persuade people to go to these great feats of invention.": 1,
    " But at a personal level, in a way I can't imagine doing your job, do you wake up in the night sometimes just asking questions about the possibly unintended consequences of your team's brilliance?": 1,
    " Sure.": 1,
    "I think you couldn't be human if you didn't ask those questions.": 1,
    "How do you answer them?": 1,
    " Well, I don't always have answers for them, right?": 1,
    "I think that we learn as time goes on.": 1,
    "I mean, my job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have.": 1,
    " I work with some of the most amazing people.": 1,
    " And with that exhilaration comes a really deep sense of responsibility.": 1,
    "And so you have on the one hand this tremendous lift of what's possible, right?": 1,
    " and this tremendous seriousness of what it means.": 1,
    " Regina, that was jaw-dropping, as they say.": 1,
    "Thank you so much for coming tonight.": 1
