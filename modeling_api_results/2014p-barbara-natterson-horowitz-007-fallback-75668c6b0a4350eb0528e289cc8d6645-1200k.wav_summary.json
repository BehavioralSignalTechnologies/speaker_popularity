    " Ten years ago, I got a phone call that changed my life.": 1,
    "At the time, I was a cardiologist at UCLA specializing in cardiac imaging techniques.": 1,
    " The call came from a veterinarian at the Los Angeles Zoo.": 1,
    "An elderly female chimpanzee had woken up with a facial droop, and the veterinarians were worried that she'd had a stroke.": 1,
    " They asked if I'd come to the zoo and image the animal's heart to look for a possible cardiac cause.": 1,
    " Now to be clear, North American zoos are staffed by highly qualified board certified veterinarians who take outstanding care of their animal patients.": 1,
    " But occasionally, they do reach in to the human medical community, particularly for subspecialty consultation.": 1,
    "And I was one of the lucky physicians who was invited in to help.": 1,
    " I had a chance to rule out a stroke in this chimpanzee and make sure that this gorilla didn't have a torn aorta.": 1,
    " Evaluate this macaw for a heart murmur.": 1,
    "Make sure that this California sea lion's pericardium wasn't inflamed.": 1,
    " And in this picture, I'm listening to the heart of a lion after a life-saving, collaborative procedure with veterinarians and physicians where we drained 700 cc's of fluid": 1,
    " from the sack in which this lion's heart was contained.": 1,
    "And this procedure, which I have done on many human patients, was identical with the exception of that paw": 1,
    " and that tale.": 1,
    " Now most of the time I was working at UCLA Medical Center with physicians discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for my human patients.": 1,
    " But some of the time, I was working at the Los Angeles Zoo with veterinarians discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments for their animal patients.": 1,
    " And occasionally, on the very same day, I went on rounds at UCLA Medical Center and at the Los Angeles Zoo.": 1,
    " And here's what started coming into very clear focus for me.": 1,
    " Physicians and veterinarians were essentially taking care of the same disorders in their animal and human patients.": 1,
    "Congestive heart failure.": 1,
    " brain tumors, leukemia, diabetes, arthritis, ALS, breast cancer.": 1,
    " Even psychiatric syndromes like depression, anxiety, compulsions, eating disorders and self-injury.": 1,
    " Now I've got a confession to make.": 1,
    " Even though I studied comparative physiology and evolutionary biology as an undergrad, I had even written my senior thesis on Darwinian theory.": 1,
    " Learning about the significant overlap between the disorders of animals and humans, it came as a much-needed wake-up call for me.": 1,
    " So I started wondering, with all of these overlaps, how was it that I had never thought to ask a veterinarian or consult the veterinary literature": 1,
    " for insights into one of my human patients.": 1,
    " Why had I never, nor had any of my physician friends and colleagues whom I asked, ever attended a veterinary conference?": 1,
    " For that matter, why was any of this a surprise?": 1,
    " I mean, look, every single physician accepts some biological connection between animals and humans.": 1,
    "Every medication that we prescribe,": 1,
    " or that we've taken ourselves or we've given to our families has first been tested on an animal.": 1,
    " But there's something very different about giving an animal a medication or a human disease and the animal developing congestive heart failure or diabetes.": 1,
    " or breast cancer on their own.": 1,
    " Now maybe some of the surprise...": 1,
    " comes from the increasing separation in our world between the urban and the non-urban.": 1,
    "We hear about these city kids who think that wool grows on trees.": 1,
    " or that cheese comes from a plant.": 1,
    " Well, today's human hospitals increasingly are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology.": 1,
    " And this creates a psychological distance between the human patients who are being treated there and animal patients who are living in oceans.": 1,
    " and farms and jungles.": 1,
    " But I think there's an even deeper reason.": 1,
    " Physicians and scientists, you know, we accept intellectually that our species, homo sapiens, is merely one species, no more unique or special than any other.": 1,
    " But in our hearts, we don't completely believe that.": 1,
    " I feel it myself when I'm listening to Mozart.": 1,
    " or looking at pictures of the Mars Rover on my MacBook, I feel that tug of human exceptionalism": 1,
    " even as I recognize the scientifically isolating cost of seeing ourselves as a superior species apart.": 1,
    " Well, I'm trying these days.": 1,
    " When I see a human patient now, I always ask, what do the animal doctors know about this problem that I don't know?": 1,
    " And might I be taking better care of my human patient if I saw them as a human animal patient?": 1,
    " Here are a few examples of the kind of exciting connections that this kind of thinking has led me to.": 1,
    " fear-induced heart failure.": 1,
    "Around the year 2000, human cardiologists discovered": 1,
    " emotionally induced heart failure.": 1,
    "It was described in a gambling father who had lost his life savings with a roll of the dice.": 1,
    " in a bride who'd been left at the altar.": 1,
    " But it turns out this new human diagnosis was neither new nor was it uniquely human.": 1,
    " veterinarians had been diagnosing, treating, and even preventing emotionally induced symptoms in animals,": 1,
    " ranging from monkeys to flamingos, from deer to rabbits since the 1970s.": 1,
    " How many human lives might have been saved if this veterinary knowledge had been put into the hands of ER docs and cardiologists?": 1,
    " self-injury.": 1,
    " Some human patients harm themselves.": 1,
    " Some pluck out patches of hair.": 1,
    " others actually cut themselves.": 1,
    " Some animal patients also harm themselves.": 1,
    "There are birds that pluck out feathers.": 1,
    "There are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed.": 1,
    " But veterinarians have very specific and very effective ways of treating and even preventing self-injury in their self-injuring animals.": 1,
    " Shouldn't this veterinary knowledge be put into the hands of psychotherapists and parents and patients struggling with self-injury?": 1,
    " Postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis.": 1,
    " Sometimes, soon after giving birth, some women become depressed, and sometimes they become seriously depressed and even psychotic.": 1,
    " They may neglect their newborn and in some extreme cases even harm the child.": 1,
    " Equine veterinarians also know that occasionally a mare, soon after giving birth, will neglect the foal, refusing to nurse, and in some instances kick the foal even to death.": 1,
    " But veterinarians have devised an intervention to deal with this full rejection syndrome.": 1,
    " that involves increasing oxytocin in the mare.": 1,
    "Oxytocin is the bonding hormone.": 1,
    "And this leads to renewed interest on the part of the mare in her foal.": 1,
    " Shouldn't this information be put into the hands of OB-GYNs and family doctors and patients who are struggling with postpartum depression and psychosis?": 1,
    " Well, despite all of this promise, unfortunately the gulf between our fields remains large.": 1,
    " To explain it, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to air some dirty laundry.": 1,
    " Some physicians can be real snobs about doctors who are not MDs.": 1,
    "I'm talking about dentists and optometrists and psychologists.": 1,
    " but maybe especially animal doctors.": 1,
    "Of course, most physicians don't realize that it is harder to get into vet school these days than medical school.": 1,
    " and that when we go to medical school, we learn everything there is to know about one species homo sapiens.": 1,
    " But veterinarians need to learn about health and disease in mammals, amphibians, reptiles, fish and birds.": 1,
    " So I don't blame the vets for feeling annoyed by my profession's condescension and ignorance.": 1,
    " But here's one from the vets.": 1,
    " What do you call a veterinarian who can only take care of one species?": 1,
    " physician.": 1,
    " Closing the gap has become a passion for me.": 1,
    " And I'm doing this through programs like Darwin on Rounds at UCLA, where we're bringing animal experts and evolutionary biologists and embedding them": 1,
    " on our medical teams with our interns and our residents.": 1,
    " and": 1,
    " through Zubiquity conferences where we bring medical schools together with veterinary schools for collaborative discussions of the shared diseases and disorders of animal and human patients.": 1,
    " At Subiquity Conferences.": 1,
    " Participants learn how treating breast cancer in a tiger": 1,
    " can help us better treat breast cancer in a kindergarten teacher.": 1,
    " how understanding polycystic ovaries in a whole steam cow can help us better take care of a dance instructor with painful periods.": 1,
    " and how better understanding the treatment of separation anxiety in a high strung shelter can help an anxious young child struggling with his first days of school.": 1,
    " In the United States and now internationally at Zubiquity conferences, physicians and veterinarians check their attitudes and their preconceptions at the door.": 1,
    " and come together as colleagues, as peers.": 1,
    " as doctors.": 1,
    " After all, we humans are animals too.": 1,
    " And it's time for us physicians to embrace our patients and our own animal natures and join veterinarians in a species spanning approach to health.": 1,
    " because it turns out some of the best and most humanistic medicine is being practiced by doctors whose patients aren't human.": 1,
    " And one of the best ways we can take care of the human patient is by paying close attention to how all the other patients on the planet": 1,
    " Live, grow, get sick, and heal.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
