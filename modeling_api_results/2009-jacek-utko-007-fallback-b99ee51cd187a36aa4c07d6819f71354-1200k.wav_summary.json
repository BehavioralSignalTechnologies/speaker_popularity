    " Newspapers are dying for a few reasons.": 1,
    "Readers don't want to pay for yesterday's news and advertisers follow them.": 1,
    "Your iPhone, your laptop is much more handy than New York Times on Sunday.": 1,
    "And we should save trees at the end.": 1,
    " So it's enough to bury any industry.": 1,
    "So we should rather ask, can anything save newspapers?": 1,
    " There are several scenarios for the future newspaper.": 1,
    "Some people say it should be free, should be tablet or even smaller A4.": 1,
    " Should be local, run by communities or niche for some smaller groups like business, but then it's not free, it's very expensive.": 1,
    "Should be opinion driven, less news, more views.": 1,
    " and we rather read it during breakfast because later we listen to radio in a car, check your mail at work and in the evening we watch TV.": 1,
    "Sounds nice but this can only buy time because in the long run": 1,
    " I think there's no reason, no practical reason for newspapers to survive.": 1,
    " So what can we do?": 1,
    " Let me tell you my story.": 1,
    "20 years ago, Bonyar, a Swedish publisher, started to set newspapers in a former Soviet block.": 1,
    "After a few years, they had several newspapers in Central and Eastern Europe.": 1,
    " They were run by an experienced staff with no visual culture, no budgets for visuals.": 1,
    "In many places there were no even art directors.": 1,
    "I decided to work for them as an art director.": 1,
    " Before I was an architect and my grandmother asked me once, what are you doing for a living?": 1,
    "I said, I'm designing newspapers.": 1,
    "What?": 1,
    "There's nothing to design there.": 1,
    "It's just boring letters.": 1,
    " And she was right, I was very frustrated.": 1,
    "Until one day, I came to London and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil.": 1,
    " And I had a revelation.": 1,
    "I thought, these guys do some creepy, run-down entertainment and put it to the highest possible level of performance art.": 1,
    "I thought, oh my God, maybe I can do the same with these boring newspapers.": 1,
    "And I did.": 1,
    " We started to redesign them one by one.": 1,
    "The front page became our signature.": 1,
    " It was my personal intimate channel to talk to the readers.": 1,
    "I'm not going to tell you stories about teamwork or cooperation.": 1,
    "My approach is very egotistic.": 1,
    "I wanted": 1,
    " my artistic statement, my interpretation of reality.": 1,
    "I wanted to make posters, not newspapers, not even magazines, posters.": 1,
    "We were experimenting with type, with illustration, with photos, and we had fun.": 1,
    "And soon it started to bring results.": 1,
    " In Poland, our pages were named covers of the year, three times in a row.": 1,
    " Other examples you can see here are from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, the Central European countries.": 1,
    " But it's not only about the front page.": 1,
    " The secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece, as one composition, like music.": 1,
    " And music has a rhythm, has ups and downs.": 1,
    "And the designer is responsible for this experience.": 1,
    " Flipping through pages is with this experience and I'm responsible for this experience.": 1,
    " We treated two pages, all spreads, as a one page because that's how readers perceive it.": 1,
    " You can see some Russian pages here which got many awards on the biggest infographic competition in Spain.": 1,
    "But the real award came from Society for Newspaper Design.": 1,
    " Just a year after the redesign of this newspaper in Poland, they named it the world's best designer's paper.": 1,
    "And two years later, the same award came to Estonia.": 1,
    " Isn't it amazing?": 1,
    " What really makes it amazing that the circulation of these newspapers were growing too.": 1,
    "Just some examples.": 1,
    "In Russia, plus 11 after one year, plus 29 after three years after redesign.": 1,
    " Same in Poland, plus 13, up to 35% rates of circulation after three years.": 1,
    "You can see on a graph, after years of stagnation, the paper started to grow, just after redesign.": 1,
    " But the real hit was in Bulgaria.": 1,
    "And that is really amazing.": 1,
    " The design does this.": 1,
    " Design was just a part of the process.": 1,
    "And the process we made was not about changing the look, it was about improving the product completely.": 1,
    " I took an architectural rule about function and form and translated it into newspaper content and design.": 1,
    "And I put a strategy at the top of it.": 1,
    "So first you ask the big question.": 1,
    "Why we do it?": 1,
    "What is the goal?": 1,
    "Then we adjust the content accordingly.": 1,
    " And then, usually after two months, we start designing.": 1,
    "My bosses, in the beginning, were very surprised.": 1,
    "Why am I asking all these business questions instead of just showing them pages?": 1,
    "But soon they realized that this is the new role of designer, to be in this process from the very beginning to the very end.": 1,
    " So what is the lesson behind it?": 1,
    "The first lesson is about the design can change not just your product, can change your workflow, actually can change everything in your company.": 1,
    "It can turn your company upside down.": 1,
    "It can even change you.": 1,
    " And who's responsible?": 1,
    "Designers.": 1,
    "Give power to designers.": 1,
    " But the second is even more important.": 1,
    " You can live in a small, poor country like me.": 1,
    "You can work for a small company in a boring branch.": 1,
    "You can have no budgets, no people, but still you can put your work to the highest possible level.": 1,
    " And everybody can do it.": 1,
    "You just need inspiration, vision and determination.": 1,
    " And you need to remember that to be good is not enough.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
