    " Democracy is in trouble, no question about that, and it comes in part from a deep dilemma in which it is embedded.": 1,
    " It's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions we face that have to do with global pandemics, a cross-border problem, with HIV, a transnational problem,": 1,
    " with markets and immigration, something that goes beyond national borders, with terrorism, with war, all now cross-border problems.": 1,
    "In fact, we live in a 21st century world of interdependence.": 1,
    " for watching. We'll see you next": 1,
    " and brutal interdependent problems.": 1,
    "And when we look for solutions in politics and in democracy, we are faced with political institutions designed 400 years ago.": 1,
    " autonomous sovereign nation states with jurisdictions and territories separate from one another, each claiming to be able to solve the problem of its own people.": 1,
    " 21st century transnational world of problems and challenges, 17th century world of political institutions.": 1,
    "In that dilemma lies the central problem of democracy.": 1,
    " And like many others, I've been thinking about what can one do about this?": 1,
    "This asymmetry between 21st century challenges and archaic and increasingly dysfunctional political institutions like nation-states.": 1,
    " And my suggestion is that we change the subject.": 1,
    "That we stop talking about nations, about bordered states, and we start talking about cities.": 1,
    " because I think you will find when we talk about cities, we are talking about the political institutions in which civilization and culture were born.": 1,
    " We are talking about the cradle of democracy.": 1,
    "We are talking about the venues in which those public spaces where we come together to create democracy and at the same time": 1,
    " protest those who would take our freedom take place.": 1,
    "Think of some great names, the Place de la Bastille, Zuccotti Park, Tahir Square.": 1,
    " Taksim Square in today's headlines in Istanbul, or yes,": 1,
    " Tiananmen Square in Beijing.": 1,
    " Those are the public spaces where we announce ourselves as citizens, as participants, as people with the right to write our own narratives.": 1,
    " Cities are not only the oldest of institutions, they're the most enduring.": 1,
    "If you think about it,": 1,
    " Constantinople, Istanbul much older than Turkey, Alexandria much older than Egypt, Rome far older than Italy.": 1,
    "Cities endure the ages.": 1,
    " They are the places where we are born, grow up, are educated, work, marry, pray, play, get old, and in time die.": 1,
    "They are home.": 1,
    " Very different than nation states, which are abstractions.": 1,
    "We pay taxes.": 1,
    "We vote occasionally.": 1,
    " We watch the men and women we choose rule more or less without us, not so in those homes known as our towns and cities where we live.": 1,
    "Moreover, today,": 1,
    " More than half of the world's population live in cities.": 1,
    "In the developed world, it's about 78%.": 1,
    " More than three out of four people live in urban institutions, urban places, in cities today.": 1,
    "So cities are where the action is.": 1,
    "Cities are us.": 1,
    "Aristotle said in the ancient world,": 1,
    " Man is a political animal.": 1,
    "I say we are an urban animal.": 1,
    "We are an urban species at home.": 1,
    " in our cities.": 1,
    "So to come back to the dilemma, if the dilemma is we have old-fashioned political nation-states unable to govern the world, respond to the global challenges that we face like climate change,": 1,
    " then maybe it's time for mayors to rule the world, for mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent to engage in global governance.": 1,
    " When I say, if mayors rule the world, when I first came up with that phrase, it occurred to me that actually they already do.": 1,
    " There are scores of international, intercity, cross-border institutions, networks of cities in which cities are already quite quietly": 1,
    " below the horizon, working together to deal with climate change, to deal with security, to deal with immigration, to deal with all of those tough interdependent problems that we face.": 1,
    "They have strange names.": 1,
    " UCLG, United Cities and Local Governments, ICLEI.": 1,
    " the International Council of Local Environmental Issues.": 1,
    "And the list goes on.": 1,
    "City Net in Asia, City Protocol, a new organization out of Barcelona that is using the web.": 1,
    " to share best practices among countries, and then all the things we know a little better, the U.S.": 1,
    "Conference of Mayors, the Mexican Conference of Mayors, the European Conference.": 1,
    " of mayors.": 1,
    "Mayors are where this is happening.": 1,
    "And so the question is,": 1,
    " How can we create a world in which mayors and the citizens they represent play a more prominent role?": 1,
    " To understand that, we need to understand why cities are special, why mayors are so different than prime ministers and presidents, because": 1,
    " My premise is that a mayor and a prime minister at the opposite ends of a political spectrum": 1,
    " To be a prime minister or president, you have to have an etiology.": 1,
    "You have to have a meta-narrative.": 1,
    "You have to have a theory of how things work.": 1,
    "You have to belong to a party.": 1,
    " independence on the whole, don't get elected to office.": 1,
    "But mayors are just the opposite.": 1,
    "Mayors are pragmatists.": 1,
    "They're problem solvers.": 1,
    "Their job is to get things done, and if they don't, they're out of a job.": 1,
    " Mayor Nutter of Philadelphia said, we could never get away here in Philadelphia with the stuff that goes on in Washington, the paralysis.": 1,
    " the non-action, the inaction.": 1,
    "Why?": 1,
    "Because potholes have to get filled.": 1,
    " because the trains have to run, because kids have to be able to get to school.": 1,
    "And that's what we have to do.": 1,
    "And to do that is about pragmatism in that deep American sense, reaching outcomes.": 1,
    "Washington...": 1,
    " Beijing, Paris as world capitals are anything but pragmatic.": 1,
    " But real city mayors have to be pragmatists.": 1,
    "They have to get things done.": 1,
    "They have to put etiology and religion and ethnicity aside and draw their cities together.": 1,
    " We saw this a couple of decades ago when Teddy Colick, the great mayor of Jerusalem in the 80s and the 90s,": 1,
    " was besieged one day in his office by religious leaders from all of the backgrounds": 1,
    " Christian prelates, rabbis, imams, they were arguing with one another about access to the holy sites.": 1,
    "And the squabble went on and on and Colick listened and listened and he finally said, gentlemen,": 1,
    " Spare me your sermons and I will fix your sewers.": 1,
    " That's what mayors do.": 1,
    "They fix sewers.": 1,
    "They get the trains running.": 1,
    "There isn't a left or right way of doing it.": 1,
    "Boris Johnson in London calls himself an anarcho-Tory.": 1,
    " Strange term, but in some ways he is, he's a libertarian, he's an anarchist, he rides to work on a bike, but at the same time he's in some ways a conservative.": 1,
    "Bloomberg in New York.": 1,
    " was a democrat, then he was a republican, and finally he was an independent and said the party label just gets in the way.": 1,
    " 20 years mayor in Moscow, though he helped found a party, a united party with Putin, in fact refused to be defined by the party and finally in fact lost his job not under Brezhnev.": 1,
    " Not under Gorbachev, but under Putin, who wanted a more faithful party follower.": 1,
    "So mayors are pragmatists and problem solvers.": 1,
    "They get things done.": 1,
    "But the second thing about mayors is they are also": 1,
    " What I like to call homeboys.": 1,
    " or to include the women mayors, homies.": 1,
    "They're from the neighborhood.": 1,
    "They're part of the neighborhood.": 1,
    "They're known.": 1,
    "Ed Koch used to wander around New York City saying, how am I doing?": 1,
    " Imagine David Cameron wandering around the United Kingdom asking, how am I doing?": 1,
    "He wouldn't like the answer or Putin or any national leader.": 1,
    "He could ask that because he knew New Yorkers and they knew him.": 1,
    " Mayors are usually from the places they govern.": 1,
    "It's pretty hard to be a carpet bagger and be a mayor.": 1,
    "You can run for the Senate out of a different state, but it's hard to do that as a mayor.": 1,
    " And as a result, mayors and city councilors and local authorities have a much higher trust level.": 1,
    "And this is the third feature about mayors than national governing officials.": 1,
    " In the United States, we know the pathetic figures.": 1,
    "18% of Americans approve of Congress and what they do.": 1,
    "And even with a relatively popular president like Obama,": 1,
    " The figures for the presidency run about 40, 45, sometimes 50 percent at best.": 1,
    "The Supreme Court has fallen way down from what it used to be.": 1,
    "But when you ask, do you trust your city councilor?": 1,
    "Do you trust your mayor?": 1,
    " The rates shoot up to 70, 75, even 80 percent because they're from the neighborhood, because the people they work with are their neighbors, because like Mayor Booker in Newark,": 1,
    " A mayor is likely to get out of his car on the way to work and go in and pull people out of a burning building.": 1,
    "That happened to Mayor Booker.": 1,
    " or intervene in a mugging in the street as he goes to work because he sees that no head of state would be permitted by their security detail to do it nor be in a position to do it.": 1,
    " That's the difference and the difference has to do with the character of cities themselves because cities are profoundly": 1,
    " multicultural, open, participatory, democratic, able to work with one another.": 1,
    "When states face each other, China and the US, they face each other like this.": 1,
    " When cities interact, they interact like this.": 1,
    "China and the US, despite the recent": 1,
    " Metta meeting in California are locked in all kinds of anger resentment and rivalry for number one We heard more about who will be number one": 1,
    " Cities don't worry about, number one, they have to work together and they do work together.": 1,
    "They work together in climate change, for example.": 1,
    " Organizations like the C40, like ICLE, which I mentioned, have been working together many, many years before Copenhagen.": 1,
    " In Copenhagen, four or five years ago, 184 nations came together to explain to one another why their sovereignty didn't permit them to deal with the grave, grave crisis of climate change.": 1,
    " but the mayor of Copenhagen had invited.": 1,
    " 200 mayors to attend they came they stayed and they found ways and are still finding ways to work together City to city and through intercity organizations 80% of carbon emissions come from cities": 1,
    " which means cities are positioned to solve the carbon problem or most of it, whether or not the states of which they are a part make agreements with one another.": 1,
    "And they are doing it.": 1,
    "Los Angeles cleaned up its port.": 1,
    " which was 40% of carbon emissions, and as a result got rid of about 20% of carbon.": 1,
    "New York has a program to upgrade its old buildings, make them better insulated in the winter.": 1,
    " to not leak energy in the summer, not leak air conditioning, that's having an impact.": 1,
    "Bogota, where Mayor Mocas, when he was mayor, he introduced a transportation system that saved energy,": 1,
    " that allowed surface buses to run in effect like subways, express buses with corridors.": 1,
    "It helped unemployment because people could get across town and it had a profound impact on climate as well as many other things.": 1,
    "There's Singapore.": 1,
    " as it developed its high-rise and its remarkable public housing, also developed an island of parks.": 1,
    "And if you go there, you'll see how much of it is Greenland and parkland.": 1,
    "Cities are doing this, but not just one by one.": 1,
    "They are doing it together.": 1,
    "They are sharing.": 1,
    " BANG!": 1,
    " what they do, and they are making a difference by shared best practices.": 1,
    "Bike shares, many of you have heard of it, started 20, 30 years ago in Latin America, now it's in hundreds of cities around the world.": 1,
    "Pedestrian zones, congestion fees.": 1,
    " emission limits in cities like California cities have.": 1,
    "There's lots and lots that cities can do even when opaque.": 1,
    " stubborn nations refuse to act.": 1,
    " So what's the bottom line here?": 1,
    " The bottom line is we still live politically in a world of borders, a world of boundaries, a world of walls, a world where states refuse to act together.": 1,
    " Yet we know that the reality we experience day to day is a world without borders.": 1,
    " a world of diseases without borders and doctors without borders, maladies sans fronti\u00e8res, m\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res, of economics and technology without borders.": 1,
    " of education without borders, of terrorism and war without borders.": 1,
    "That is the real world.": 1,
    "And unless we find a way to globalize democracy or democratize globalization,": 1,
    " we will increasingly not only risk...": 1,
    " the failure to address all of these transnational problems, but we will risk losing democracy itself locked up in the old nation state box.": 1,
    " unable to address global problems democratically.": 1,
    " So where does that leave us?": 1,
    "I'll tell you, the road to global democracy doesn't run through states.": 1,
    "It runs through cities.": 1,
    " Democracy was born in the ancient polis.": 1,
    "I believe it can be reborn.": 1,
    " in the global cosmopolis.": 1,
    "In that journey from polis to cosmopolis, we can rediscover the power": 1,
    " of democracy on a global level.": 1,
    "We can create not a league of nations which fail but a league of cities, not a united or a disunited nations.": 1,
    " but united cities of the world.": 1,
    "We can create a global parliament of mayors.": 1,
    "That's an idea it's in.": 1,
    " my conception of the coming world, but it's also on the table in city halls in Seoul, Korea, in Amsterdam, in Hamburg.": 1,
    " And in New York, mayors are considering that idea of how you can actually constitute a global parliament of mayors.": 1,
    "And I love that idea because a parliament of mayors": 1,
    " is a parliament of citizens and a parliament of citizens is a parliament of us, of you and of me.": 1,
    "If ever there were citizens without borders,": 1,
    " I think it's the citizens of TED who show the promise to be those citizens without borders.": 1,
    "I'm ready to reach out and embrace a new world.": 1,
    " global democracy, to take back our democracy.": 1,
    "And the only question is, are you?": 1,
    "Thank you so much, my fellow citizens.": 1,
    " Thank you": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
