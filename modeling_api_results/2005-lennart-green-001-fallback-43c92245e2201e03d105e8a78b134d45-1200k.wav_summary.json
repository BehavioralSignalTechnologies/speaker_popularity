    "Yeah.": 7,
    " Yeah.": 6,
    "Good.": 6,
    " Good.": 5,
    "Okay.": 4,
    " Now...": 3,
    " Okay.": 3,
    " So.": 3,
    " And...": 3,
    "Thank you.": 3,
    " Yes?": 3,
    "Yes?": 3,
    "Jack of spades.": 3,
    " Yeah, good.": 3,
    " Right?": 2,
    "Over the heart, don't move the wrist.": 2,
    "Oh, sorry.": 2,
    "That was a mistake.": 2,
    "Sorry.": 2,
    "Yeah, good.": 2,
    "Ten of diamonds.": 2,
    " Thank you very much.": 2,
    "Five of clubs.": 2,
    "No?": 2,
    " No?": 2,
    "Yes.": 2,
    " Which size?": 2,
    " My favorite topic is shortcuts.": 1,
    "The master of shortcuts is of course nature.": 1,
    "But I will demonstrate": 1,
    " different ways to get rid of difficulties and go to the point to find an answer probably much quicker than an author did.": 1,
    " First we violate the common sense, the logic.": 1,
    "All of you, if you hold your hand like this, 90 degrees.": 1,
    " All of you, right?": 1,
    "Palm up.": 1,
    "If you do this...": 1,
    " The logic says you must turn the wrist, you agree?": 1,
    "But I will first teach you a method, how you can do it without moving the wrist, and then the shortcut.": 1,
    " You can do it immediately, right?": 1,
    "Hold the hand like this, palm up.": 1,
    "Don't move the wrist.": 1,
    "The wrist is... I don't speak very much, but I know the best what I am.": 1,
    "Molded, you say, with iron?": 1,
    "That was a joke, actually.": 1,
    "And I... OK.": 1,
    " Hold the hand palm up, do this, don't move the wrist.": 1,
    "Forward, don't move the wrist.": 1,
    "Up, don't move the wrist.": 1,
    "And forward.": 1,
    " Logically, you have got to this position from this without moving the wrist.": 1,
    " Now the shortcut.": 1,
    " But it was six moves, now with one move.": 1,
    "I start here, palm down, you can follow.": 1,
    " And then look at me.": 1,
    " That was a warming up.": 1,
    " I need an assistant.": 1,
    "I talked to a nice girl before.": 1,
    "Sui, chest lift.": 1,
    "No, a big hand.": 1,
    "Nice.": 1,
    "And you can sit over there.": 1,
    "One item here was water, right?": 1,
    " And I will give my tribute to water.": 1,
    "I think it's enough with water for me.": 1,
    "The other guys can talk about the cheers.": 1,
    " Beer has about, there's a lot of water in beer.": 1,
    " So, now.": 1,
    " I will demonstrate different ways of memorizing control cards and so on.": 1,
    "And I think I'll take over this one.": 1,
    " I work with a special method to do it quick.": 1,
    "I work with precision.": 1,
    " Control.": 1,
    " and a very powerful": 1,
    " Memory system, right?": 1,
    " If...": 1,
    " I have studied the poker, I like to gamble.": 1,
    "Officially I don't gamble, but so if we are": 1,
    " if we have a five-person, and I will do a five-handed poker game.": 1,
    " Now I will interact, so different person all the time, so not the same person can answer, so we have an agreement.": 1,
    " Which one shall have a good poker hand?": 1,
    "Which number?": 1,
    "One, two, three, four, or five?": 1,
    "Three, good.": 1,
    " And here.": 1,
    " I had a match here to make a little... The critical moment is... Sorry.": 1,
    " If a card shark gather the card together, immediately when he": 1,
    " before he deal the card.": 1,
    "Now.": 1,
    " So I think number three, I have arranged them in a full house.": 1,
    " Queens and... It's okay.": 1,
    "Queens and tens.": 1,
    " as a challenge.": 1,
    "I like this.": 1,
    "I will explain it.": 1,
    "One, two, three, four, five.": 1,
    "I start with three queens.": 1,
    " So here you see the contrast when I treat the cards.": 1,
    " and two tenths.": 1,
    " But also the other hand is good if all the other guys has good hands too.": 1,
    "So these guys has actually a stronger hand.": 1,
    "Three aces and two kings.": 1,
    " This guy beats them with two, four of a kind of deuce.": 1,
    " No reaction.": 1,
    "That was even... Okay.": 1,
    "And this.": 1,
    "This look in order, hopefully.": 1,
    "Three, four, five, six, seven.": 1,
    "And...": 1,
    " But of course, I will have the winning hand.": 1,
    "Ten, jack, queen, king, ace.": 1,
    "So.": 1,
    " Go.": 1,
    " So the hand that looks so good from the beginning, number three, at the end was actually the lowest hand.": 1,
    "Such life, right?": 1,
    " So please, mix them.": 1,
    "Now, if you are interested, I will demonstrate some underground techniques.": 1,
    " I work with...": 1,
    " kind of estimation, shuffle tracking.": 1,
    "Ah, good.": 1,
    "Impressive.": 1,
    " So, first...": 1,
    " The first term is estimation.": 1,
    "Here I can estimate exactly how many cards I put between my royal flash.": 1,
    "Of course I can count the cards, but this is much quicker, right?": 1,
    "You agree?": 1,
    " So here I have actually, and I know exactly where the cards are.": 1,
    "So here I can make a bet, and this is actually one of the points where I get my money.": 1,
    "So here, 10 jack, queen, king, ace.": 1,
    " Next.": 1,
    " is a term": 1,
    " I do it quick.": 1,
    "I call this stealing.": 1,
    " So here, I think I knew about where the cards are.": 1,
    "I will spread the cards and you say stop when I point it to them, right?": 1,
    "Point, say stop.": 1,
    "Here, you see some are missing and that's the stealing cards, which I did.": 1,
    " Now, another term called shuffle tracking.": 1,
    "Shuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards.": 1,
    " even if another person shuffle.": 1,
    "This is a little risky.": 1,
    "So because if you look now, I can still see it, you agree?": 1,
    "But if you square, square and shuffle.": 1,
    " And it can't.": 1,
    "So here, to follow my cards, I must look at the shuffle from the beginning.": 1,
    "Ah, you have started to get it.": 1,
    "Okay, it's okay, it's okay.": 1,
    "No, no, no.": 1,
    " I'm joking.": 1,
    "Any style.": 1,
    " Here I have to calculate, but actually I don't like to calculate.": 1,
    "I work directly with the right brain.": 1,
    "If you pass the left brain, you have to take care of logic and common sense.": 1,
    " Direct in the right plane, that's much better.": 1,
    " Arthur Benjamin did a little of the same thing.": 1,
    "And if you work in the right atmosphere with humor, that's the password to the...": 1,
    " Cosmic Bank of Knowledge, where you can find any solution of any problem.": 1,
    "Okay, now I drop the cards and you say stop anywhere, right?": 1,
    "Not at the last card.": 1,
    " Yeah, when I'm sober, I do this much quicker, but we will check.": 1,
    " Ah, not in order.": 1,
    " No, I'm kidding.": 1,
    " No, now and then I put in a mistake.": 1,
    "Just to emphasize how difficult it is, right?": 1,
    " Yeah, last night I forgot that.": 1,
    "But now I'm glad I remember it.": 1,
    "So, this deck is bought here.": 1,
    "I have a little pad to make it a little softer.": 1,
    " This deck is bought here in America, it's called bicycle.": 1,
    "And this deck is very flexible, but not so many people know.": 1,
    " If you press at the right spots, you see how thin and flexible this deck is, right?": 1,
    " Now you can carry this in your wallet.": 1,
    " You don't see it?": 1,
    "No reaction?": 1,
    " So, but here.": 1,
    " Is the camera getting too much?": 1,
    "No.": 1,
    " on and then when you will have it back you do this but not too much then you have to push it down again here please if you push this": 1,
    " So everyone see?": 1,
    "Push them together.": 1,
    "So they're really interlaced, right?": 1,
    " Perfect.": 1,
    "Just push them.": 1,
    " And then I will demonstrate a thing from a Russian satellite, stolen, probably copied from America.": 1,
    "We'll see.": 1,
    " here.": 1,
    " Shortcuts, I talk about shortcuts.": 1,
    "Now I go very quick through the deck and try to find some pattern.": 1,
    " The new chaos theory is already old, right?": 1,
    "But you know, I think you are familiar with fractals, the Mandelbrot spirals and all these things.": 1,
    " And it's much.": 1,
    " easier to memorize cards in a patterned way and not concentrate.": 1,
    "If you concentrate and calculate, then it's the left brain.": 1,
    "But if you just look and talk in another language,": 1,
    " Uh...": 1,
    " Yeah, great.": 1,
    "I think I have it.": 1,
    "So now different persons all the time.": 1,
    "Please name any card, anyone.": 1,
    " Jack of spades.": 1,
    "I think Jack of spades is number 12 from the top.": 1,
    " 12.": 1,
    "Yes, right.": 1,
    "Oh, Jack of spades.": 1,
    "You said spades.": 1,
    "My fault.": 1,
    "Don't applaud.": 1,
    "This was clubs.": 1,
    "So Jack of spades.": 1,
    " I think...": 1,
    " 23, 24, sorry, 24.": 1,
    " 25, yes.": 1,
    "It's the right.": 1,
    "Now I do it quicker, better.": 1,
    " Okay, another person.": 1,
    "Oh, I forgot that I shouldn't shuffle.": 1,
    " Actually, my technique is to peek.": 1,
    "All the time.": 1,
    " When I lift the heap, I peek.": 1,
    " You see?": 1,
    "Yeah, perfect.": 1,
    " Three, four, five, six, then I calculate, yeah, good.": 1,
    " Another person, another card.": 1,
    "Seven of diamonds, perfect, my favorite.": 1,
    "So I will do it quick, very quick, but in slow motion so you can follow.": 1,
    " Seven of diamonds.": 1,
    "I'll start here.": 1,
    " Good?": 1,
    " The thing I did, I peeked so I didn't know where the card was, then I took it.": 1,
    "So another person, another card.": 1,
    " Another person?": 1,
    " Pon.": 1,
    "I think I do it the same way.": 1,
    "I like to... So I know where it is.": 1,
    "But now I do it the regular speed, right?": 1,
    " Maybe you'll cut.": 1,
    " Excellent.": 1,
    "So thank you.": 1,
    "Another person, another card.": 1,
    " Pardon?": 1,
    "It's not the same person, even if it's the same spot.": 1,
    "We can take some over there later.": 1,
    "So now I will drop the cards and you say stop anywhere.": 1,
    "Got it?": 1,
    " Not the less, yeah, that's difficult to find a card here.": 1,
    "We do it again.": 1,
    "The person who said five of clubs, say stop when the cards are in the air, right?": 1,
    " Very good.": 1,
    " Yeah, okay.": 1,
    " Okay, I have to use a little force there.": 1,
    " I think we'll save five of clubs.": 1,
    "And now a card with the contrast of five of clubs.": 1,
    " Queen of Hearts, yeah, excellent.": 1,
    "I love that card.": 1,
    " Yeah, I do.": 1,
    " And here, I will do the most difficult thing.": 1,
    "For example, you are sitting in Las Vegas, and you're betting, and you let the other guys pick this card by mistake.": 1,
    "Feel it's just a regular one card.": 1,
    " And now when I lift this card, it shall be your card.": 1,
    "What was your card?": 1,
    " Queen of... Queen of Hearts.": 1,
    "So that's a tough challenge, right?": 1,
    " So here I grab, you know this, fiber clamps and queen of hearts.": 1,
    "Yes!": 1,
    " This is a tough one.": 1,
    " Because here I must take advantage of... I'll switch it with five of clubs.": 1,
    " So now a false count.": 1,
    "Which card shall I use?": 1,
    "Queen or five?": 1,
    "Queen, yeah.": 1,
    " So I use the queen and here's five of clubs.": 1,
    "The false count to any number one, two, three.": 1,
    " Four, five, six, seven, eight.": 1,
    "You say the same card all the time.": 1,
    "Nine, ten.": 1,
    "This is a kind of optical deal, right?": 1,
    " When I put one card at the table, look, it's not one card.": 1,
    "It's a bunch of cards that gives this impression.": 1,
    " Now some hard stuff.": 1,
    " I think we keep the Queen here, yes.": 1,
    " Now to the satellites things.": 1,
    " This... Yeah.": 1,
    "Don't look at the bee, my fault.": 1,
    " This is a high frequency laser.": 1,
    " And it's enough with a fraction of a second to destroy the retina completely.": 1,
    "I should have mentioned that.": 1,
    "But you can relax.": 1,
    "Because it takes half an hour before it works, so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance.": 1,
    " I put the laser here, and now when I deal the cards in the laser,": 1,
    " I know where they are, but yes, did the camera go to it?": 1,
    " They didn't?": 1,
    " What happened?": 1,
    " Okay, takes another group.": 1,
    " Do the cameras see the calls now?": 1,
    " But you see the hand?": 1,
    "Ah, good, good, good.": 1,
    "But now.": 1,
    "So now, that was the reason, right?": 1,
    "You see the cards?": 1,
    "Now...": 1,
    " One guy left.": 1,
    "So now to find the queen.": 1,
    "Go this way, take back the other one, take back the queen.": 1,
    " Yeah, interesting.": 1,
    " a little dangerous.": 1,
    " I like it.": 1,
    "Now, a little more difficult.": 1,
    "Name anyone.": 1,
    "Name please any suit.": 1,
    " Spades, spades, good.": 1,
    "So here...": 1,
    " I have to pick lots of cards.": 1,
    "I think there are lots of, I don't know how many, but 10, 15 spades in the deck at least, right?": 1,
    " So every time I lift the hip, I peek, right?": 1,
    "Then I arrange them so I can get them quick.": 1,
    "Perfect.": 1,
    "Excellent.": 1,
    "So I start with the ace.": 1,
    " Yeah, it's... Ah, it's spades!": 1,
    " The same mistake as before, right?": 1,
    "So I arranged the clamps.": 1,
    "I tried to do it this way.": 1,
    "First I take the spans.": 1,
    "You see, I don't work with prestige, so I always do mistakes.": 1,
    " It doesn't matter to me.": 1,
    "And now and then I get some extra sympathy points, right?": 1,
    " One.": 1,
    " Two, three, four, yes.": 1,
    "The camera go to five, six, seven, eight.": 1,
    " Nine, ten.": 1,
    "Jack.": 1,
    "Queen of spades.": 1,
    "I like that laugh.": 1,
    "Queen.": 1,
    " Please take any card.": 1,
    "Grab any card.": 1,
    "Quick, quick.": 1,
    "And we switch this to the king.": 1,
    "Ace of diamonds.": 1,
    "And now look.": 1,
    "Ace of diamonds with guide.": 1,
    " So I find King of Spades.": 1,
    "There was a place, and here's King of Spades, correct?": 1,
    "Yeah, okay.": 1,
    " Now, a little more difficult thing.": 1,
    "Maybe you think I have the cards in order already, so you help me to shuffle again.": 1,
    "Another suit, please.": 1,
    " Bye!": 1,
    " It was after the blindfold.": 1,
    " I like this guy.": 1,
    " Okay, that should be my end effect, but okay.": 1,
    "Who said Armani?": 1,
    "You?": 1,
    "I drop the cards and you switch sides.": 1,
    "It's a piece of cake.": 1,
    "I like challenges.": 1,
    " Extra large, okay.": 1,
    "Say stop.": 1,
    " Yeah, I'm on it.": 1,
    " This is tough.": 1,
    " Okay, a suit.": 1,
    "I have clubs before, space, another suit.": 1,
    "Diamonds, perfect.": 1,
    "So in this case, I tried to...": 1,
    " to locate diamonds, I look at the cards and okay, we try.": 1,
    "Yeah, you help me.": 1,
    "If I drop a card face up,": 1,
    " Like this, you reverse it.": 1,
    "Okay, now.": 1,
    "With both hands.": 1,
    "And quick, yes, good, good, good.": 1,
    " I think we have it now.": 1,
    "Yeah, good, good.": 1,
    " Diamonds.": 1,
    "Hearts.": 1,
    "No diamonds.": 1,
    "Good, good.": 1,
    " Do you see the pattern?": 1,
    "Now?": 1,
    "Yes, yes, okay.": 1,
    "I work with pattern.": 1,
    " Oh, sorry, I dropped one.": 1,
    " Maybe it's important.": 1,
    "Nine of diamonds, okay.": 1,
    "So now...": 1,
    " I always ask, why do I put myself in this position?": 1,
    " I have to figure out so many outs when I miss, of course.": 1,
    "But I love it.": 1,
    "So now I will do it.": 1,
    "I will try to find...": 1,
    " find the diamonds, but I will do it the hard way.": 1,
    "It's too easy to do it right away, right?": 1,
    " I think I will do it.": 1,
    " blindfolded.": 1,
    " At this distance, it works immediately.": 1,
    " Dock tape.": 1,
    " And look, check the cards, I don't.": 1,
    "I like the empathy.": 1,
    "Empathy.": 1,
    "But it was, did you hear?": 1,
    "It was women's voice.": 1,
    "Hear the guy?": 1,
    "Yeah, more, more, more.": 1,
    "Yeah, you can take the nostril too, because some guys think...": 1,
    " Some guys think I can peek through their nostrils.": 1,
    " Go go go.": 1,
    " Satisfied?": 1,
    "Looks good like Batman.": 1,
    " No, with dignity and elegance, right?": 1,
    " But I like her, yeah.": 1,
    "I said, be a little tough.": 1,
    "And it was okay.": 1,
    "One more?": 1,
    "The last.": 1,
    "Now you must agree that I'm...": 1,
    " I must rely on other senses, right?": 1,
    " I work with vibration.": 1,
    " What was the card?": 1,
    "Diamonds.": 1,
    "Ah, I memorized holes.": 1,
    "So now I have to improvise again.": 1,
    " Maybe I'll stand up, half.": 1,
    "Diamonds, I'll start with Ace of Diamonds.": 1,
    " Just kidding, warming up, king of hearts.": 1,
    " And I give you diamonds, so you put them here in a nice row, right?": 1,
    "And you can see.": 1,
    "Eight of diamonds, yes.": 1,
    " Two, thank you.": 1,
    "I never ever missed two, this is interesting.": 1,
    "Always I've found two.": 1,
    "But you're wrong color, spades, sorry.": 1,
    " The deck is a gift to you after.": 1,
    "Let the scepticals here examine it.": 1,
    "Remind me, it's a gift.": 1,
    "It was two of spades, right?": 1,
    "Sorry, two of diamonds.": 1,
    "I'll do it quick now.": 1,
    " Three.": 1,
    "Three of diamonds.": 1,
    "Four.": 1,
    "I like challenges, yes.": 1,
    " Good morning.": 1,
    " This is a request from the media device.": 1,
    " Oh, God.": 1,
    " Yeah, I was listening.": 1,
    " Okay, now.": 1,
    " This is maybe a little tough.": 1,
    "We will try.": 1,
    " Yes, good.": 1,
    " How many cards?": 1,
    "Five?": 1,
    "Four?": 1,
    "Is five the next card?": 1,
    " It's not here.": 1,
    "Oh.": 1,
    "So here.": 1,
    " All the cards are face down, you agree?": 1,
    "You see that in the screen?": 1,
    "And this is face up, and it's not at the bottom here.": 1,
    "So next card will be, was it five?": 1,
    "Yeah, I will reverse it, face up here.": 1,
    " with the thumb.": 1,
    " Seven.": 1,
    " Yes, I do this.": 1,
    "I know what it is because I picked the four and then I do this.": 1,
    "Right?": 1,
    " Eight.": 1,
    " And then nine, right?": 1,
    " Yesterday, the day before yesterday, I was in Vegas and I used this actually.": 1,
    "Nine, yeah?": 1,
    "Correct?": 1,
    "Yes, that was a good one.": 1,
    " Ten.": 1,
    " Once again, I love this Johnny Wayne move.": 1,
    " Jack, Jack of diamonds, correct?": 1,
    " Queen with misdirection.": 1,
    " Let me start it.": 1,
    " And then king after exact five seconds.": 1,
