    " I got up this morning at 6 10 a.m.": 1,
    "after going to sleep at 12 45 a.m.": 1,
    "I was awakened once during the night.": 1,
    " My heart rate was 61 beats per minute.": 1,
    "My blood pressure 127 over 74.": 1,
    "I had zero minutes of exercise yesterday, so my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn't calculated.": 1,
    " I had about 600 milligrams of caffeine, zero of alcohol, and my score on the Narcissism Personality Index, or the NPI-16, is a reassuring .31.": 1,
    " We know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise, manage, govern, search.": 1,
    " I'm going to talk about how they're useful when we reflect, learn, remember, and want to improve.": 1,
    "A few years ago, Kevin Kelly, my partner and I": 1,
    " Notice that people were subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking that went far beyond the ordinary familiar habits such as stepping on a scale every day.": 1,
    "People were tracking their food via Twitter.": 1,
    " their kids' diapers on their iPhone.": 1,
    "They were making detailed journals of their spending, their mood, their symptoms, their treatments.": 1,
    " Now, we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle, the uptake diffusion of mobile devices, the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing.": 1,
    " and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors.": 1,
    "This little black dot there is a 3D accelerometer attracts your movement.": 1,
    " through space.": 1,
    "It's, as you can see, very small and also very cheap.": 1,
    "They're now down to well under a dollar a piece, and they're going into all kinds of devices.": 1,
    "But what's interesting is the incredible detailed information that you can get": 1,
    " from just one sensor like this.": 1,
    "This kind of sensor is in the hit biometric device among early adopters at the moment, the Fitbit.": 1,
    "This tracks your activity and also your sleep.": 1,
    " has just that sensor in it.": 1,
    "You're probably familiar with the Nike Plus system.": 1,
    "I just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor.": 1,
    "It's really just a pressure sensor like the kind that's in a doorbell.": 1,
    " And Nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor.": 1,
    "This is the strap that people use to transmit.": 1,
    " heart rate data to the IQ Plus system.": 1,
    "This is a beautiful new device that gives you detailed sleep tracking data, not just whether you're asleep or awake, but also your phase of sleep, deep sleep, light sleep, REM sleep.": 1,
    " The sensor's just a little strip of metal in that headband there.": 1,
    "The rest of it is the bedside console.": 1,
    "Just for reference, this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago.": 1,
    "I mean, really, until now.": 1,
    " and this is the sleep tracking system of today.": 1,
    "This just was presented at a healthcare conference in DC.": 1,
    "Most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler.": 1,
    " But the top is a very small GPS transceiver, which gives you the date and location of an asthma incident, giving you new awareness of your vulnerability in relation to time and environmental factors.": 1,
    " Now, we know that new tools are changing our sense of self in the world.": 1,
    "These tiny sensors that gather data in nature.": 1,
    " the ubiquitous computing that allows that data to be understood and used, and of course the social networks that allow people to collaborate and contribute.": 1,
    " But we think of these tools as pointing outward.": 1,
    " as windows and I just like to invite you to think of them as also turning inward and becoming mirrors so that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement": 1,
    " We also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement, for self-discovery, self-awareness, self-knowledge.": 1,
    " Here's a biometric device, a pair of Apple earbuds.": 1,
    "Last year, Apple filed some patents to get blood oxygenation, heart rate, and body temperature via the earbuds.": 1,
    " What is this for?": 1,
    " What should it be for?": 1,
    "Some people will say it's for biometric security.": 1,
    "Some people will say it's for public health research.": 1,
    "Some people will say it's for avant-garde marketing research.": 1,
    " I'd like to tell you that it's also for self-knowledge.": 1,
    "The self isn't the only thing.": 1,
    "It's not even most things.": 1,
    "The self is just our operation center.": 1,
    " our consciousness, our moral compass.": 1,
    "So if we want to act more effectively in the world, we have to get to know ourselves better.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
