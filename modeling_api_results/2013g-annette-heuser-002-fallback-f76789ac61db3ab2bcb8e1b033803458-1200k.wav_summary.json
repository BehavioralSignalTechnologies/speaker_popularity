    " Almost two years ago I was driving in my car in Germany and I turned on the radio.": 1,
    "Europe at the time was in the middle of the euro crisis.": 1,
    " All the headlines were about European countries getting downgraded by rating agencies in the United States.": 1,
    "I listened and thought to myself,": 1,
    " What are these rating agencies and why is everybody so upset about their work?": 1,
    " Well, if you were sitting next to me in the car that day and would have told me that I would devote the next years trying to reform them, obviously I would have called you crazy.": 1,
    " But guess what's really crazy?": 1,
    "The way these rating agencies are run.": 1,
    "And I would like to explain to you not only why it's time to change this, but also how we can do it.": 1,
    " So let me tell you a little bit about what rating agencies really do.": 1,
    "As you would read": 1,
    " car magazine before purchasing a new car or taking a look at a product review before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get.": 1,
    " Investors are reading ratings before they decide in which kind of product they are investing their money.": 1,
    " A rating can range from a so-called triple A, which means it's a top performing product, and it can go down to the level of the so-called triple B minus, which means it's a fairly risky investment.": 1,
    " Rating agencies are rating companies, they are rating banks, they are rating even financial products like the infamous mortgage-backed securities.": 1,
    "But they can also rate countries.": 1,
    " And these ratings are called sovereign ratings.": 1,
    "And I would like to focus in particular on these sovereign ratings.": 1,
    " And I can tell as you're listening to me right now, you're thinking, so why should I really care about this, right?": 1,
    "Be honest.": 1,
    "Well, ratings affect you.": 1,
    "They affect all of us.": 1,
    " If a rating agency rates a country, it basically assesses and evaluates a country's debt and the ability and willingness of a country to repay its debt.": 1,
    " So if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency, the country has to pay more in order to borrow money on the international markets.": 1,
    " So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer because you and your fellow countrymen have to pony up more in order to borrow, right?": 1,
    "But what if a country can't afford to pay more because it's maybe too expensive?": 1,
    " Well, then the country has less available for other services like roads, schools, health care.": 1,
    "And this is the reason why you should care.": 1,
    " because sovereign ratings affect everyone.": 1,
    "And that is the reason why I believe they should be defined as public goods.": 1,
    "They should be transparent, accessible and available to everyone at no cost.": 1,
    " But here's the situation.": 1,
    "The rating agency market is dominated by three players and three players only.": 1,
    "Standard and Poor's, Moody's and Fitch.": 1,
    " And we know whenever there is a market concentration, there is really no competition, right?": 1,
    "There is no incentive to improve the quality of your product.": 1,
    " And let's face it, the credit rating agencies have contributed, putting the global economy on the brink, and yet they have to change the way they operate.": 1,
    " The second point, would you really buy a car just based on the advice of the dealer?": 1,
    "Obviously not, right?": 1,
    "That would be irresponsible.": 1,
    " That's actually what's going on in the rating agency sector every single day.": 1,
    "The customers of these rating agencies, like countries or companies,": 1,
    " They are paying for their own ratings and obviously this is creating a conflict of interest.": 1,
    " The third point is the rating agencies are not really telling us how they are coming up with their ratings.": 1,
    " But in this day and age you can't even sell a candy bar without listing everything that's inside.": 1,
    "But for ratings, a crucial element of our economy.": 1,
    " We really do not know what all the different ingredients are.": 1,
    "We are allowing the rating agencies to be intransparent about their work.": 1,
    "And we need to change this.": 1,
    " I think there is no doubt that the sector needs a complete overhaul, not just a trimming at the margins.": 1,
    "I think it's time for a bold move.": 1,
    "I think it's time to upgrade the system.": 1,
    " And this is why we at the Bertelsmann Foundation have invested a lot of time and efforts thinking about an alternative for the sector.": 1,
    " And we have developed the first model for a non-profit rating agency for sovereign risk.": 1,
    "And we call it by its acronym INCRA.": 1,
    " Incra would make a difference to the current system by adding another non-profit player to the mix.": 1,
    "It would be based on a non-profit model.": 1,
    " that would be based on a sustainable endowment.": 1,
    "The endowment would create income that would allow us to run the operation, to run the rating agency.": 1,
    "And it would also allow us to make our ratings publicly available.": 1,
    " for joining us.": 1,
    " But this is not enough to make a difference, right?": 1,
    "INGRA would also be based on a very, very clear governance structure that would avoid any conflict of interest and it would include many stakeholders from the society.": 1,
    " INGRA would not only be a European or an American rating agency, it would be a truly international one, in which in particular the emerging economies would have an equal interest, voice and representation.": 1,
    " The second big difference that INCRA would make is that it would base its sovereign risk assessment on a broader set of indicators.": 1,
    " Think about it that way.": 1,
    "If we conduct a sovereign rating, we basically take a look at the economic soil of a country, its macroeconomic fundamentals.": 1,
    " But we also have to ask the question, who is cultivating the economic soil of a country, right?": 1,
    " Well, a country has many gardeners, and one of them is the government.": 1,
    "So we have to ask the question, how is a country governed?": 1,
    "How is it managed?": 1,
    "And this is the reason why we have developed what we call forward-looking indicators.": 1,
    " These are indicators that give you a much better read about the socio-economic development of a country.": 1,
    "I hope you would agree it's important for you to know if your government is willing to invest in energy and renewable": 1,
    " renewable energy and education, right?": 1,
    "It's important for you to know if the government of your country is able to manage a crisis, if the government is finally able to implement the reforms that it's promised.": 1,
    " For example, if INGRA would raid South Africa right now, of course we would take a very, very close look at the youth unemployment of the country, the highest in the world.": 1,
    " If over 70% of a country's population under the age of 35 is unemployed, of course this has a huge impact on the economy today and even more so in the future.": 1,
    " Well, our friends at Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch will tell us we would take this into account as well.": 1,
    " But guess what?": 1,
    "We do not know exactly how they would take this into account.": 1,
    "And this leads me to the third big difference that INGRA would make.": 1,
    " INGRA would not only release its ratings, but it would also release its indicators and methodology.": 1,
    "So in contrast to the current system, INGRA would be fully transparent.": 1,
    " So in a nutshell, INGRA would offer an alternative to the current system of the big three rating agencies by adding a new non-profit player to the mix that would increase the competition": 1,
    " it would increase the transparency of the sector, and it would also increase the quality.": 1,
    "I can tell that sovereign ratings may still look to you like this very small piece of this very complex global financial world.": 1,
    " But I tell you it's a very important one and a very important one to fix because sovereign ratings affect all of us and they should be addressed and should be defined as public goods.": 1,
    " And this is why we are testing our model right now and why we are trying to find out if we can bring together a group of able and willing actors to bring INGRA to life.": 1,
    " I truly believe building up INCRA is in everyone's interest and that we have the unique opportunity right now": 1,
    " to turn INCRA into a cornerstone of a new, more inclusive financial system.": 1,
    "Because for way too long,": 1,
    " we have left the big financial players on their own.": 1,
    "It's time to give them some company.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
