    " It's very, very difficult to...": 1,
    " wrap up to speak at the end of a conference like this.": 1,
    "Because everyone has spoken, everything has been said.": 1,
    "So I thought that what may be useful is to remind us": 1,
    " of some of the things that have gone on here and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away and take forward and work on.": 1,
    " That's what I'd like to try and do.": 1,
    "We came here saying we want to talk about Africa, the next chapter.": 1,
    " But we are talking about Africa the next chapter because we are looking at the old and the present chapter that we're looking at and saying it's not such a good thing.": 1,
    " The picture I showed you before and this picture of drought, death and disease is what we usually see.": 1,
    " What we want to look at is Africa, the next chapter.": 1,
    "And that's this.": 1,
    "A healthy, smiling, beautiful African.": 1,
    " And I think it's worth remembering what we've heard through this conference right from the first day where I heard that all the important statistics have been given.": 1,
    " about where we are now, about how the continent is doing much better.": 1,
    "And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on.": 1,
    "So I'm not going to spend too much time just to show you, refresh your memories that": 1,
    " We are here for Africa, the next chapter, because for the first time, there really is a platform to build on.": 1,
    "We really do have it going right, that the continent is growing at rates that people thought would not happen.": 1,
    " decades of 2%, we are now at 5% and it's going to projected 6% and 7% even and inflation has come down.": 1,
    " External debt, something that I can tell you a long story about, because I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent, has come down dramatically.": 1,
    "You know, as you can see, from almost 50 billion down to about": 1,
    " 12 or 13 billion now.": 1,
    "This is a huge achievement.": 1,
    "You know, we've built up reserves.": 1,
    "Why is that important?": 1,
    "It's because it shows up our economies.": 1,
    " shows up our currencies and gives a platform on which people can plan and build, including businesses.": 1,
    "We've also seen": 1,
    " Some evidence that all this is making a difference because private investment flows have increased.": 1,
    "I want to remind you again, I know you saw these statistics before, from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion.": 1,
    " In 2005, remittances, I just took one country, Nigeria, skyrocketing is too dramatic, but increasing.": 1,
    " dramatically and in many other countries this is happening.": 1,
    "Why is this important?": 1,
    "Because it shows confidence that people are now confident to bring if your people in the diaspora": 1,
    " bring their money back.": 1,
    "It shows other people that look, there's emerging confidence in your country and instead of an outflow, you're now getting a net inflow.": 1,
    "Now why is all this important?": 1,
    "I have to go really fast.": 1,
    " It's important that we build this platform, that we have the present Equators and others of our leaders who are saying, look, we must do something different, because we are confronted with a challenge.": 1,
    "62% of our population is below the age of 24.": 1,
    " What does this mean?": 1,
    "This means that we have to focus on how our youth are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives.": 1,
    " focus on how to create jobs, make sure they don't fall into disease, that they get an education, but most of all that they are productively engaged in life and that they are creating the kind of productive environment in our countries that will make things happen.": 1,
    " And you know, to support this, I just recently, one of the things I've done since leaving government is to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria.": 1,
    "Most of our countries don't even have any opinion research.": 1,
    "People don't have voice.": 1,
    " There is no way you can know what people want.": 1,
    "One of the things we asked them recently was what's their top issue.": 1,
    "Like in every other country where this has been done, jobs is the top issue.": 1,
    " I want to leave this up here and come back to it.": 1,
    "But before I get to this slide, I just wanted to run you through this and to say that for me, the next stage of building this platform": 1,
    " that now enables us to move forward and we mustn't make light of it.": 1,
    "It's only five, six, seven years ago, we couldn't even talk about the next chapter.": 1,
    " Because we were in the old chapter, we were going nowhere.": 1,
    "Economies were not growing.": 1,
    "We were having negative per capita growth.": 1,
    " The macroeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward was not even there.": 1,
    "So let's not forget that it's taken a lot to build this, including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to.": 1,
    " creating our own program to solve problems.": 1,
    " like fighting corruption, building institutions, stabilizing the macro economy.": 1,
    "So now we have this platform we can build on.": 1,
    "And it brings us to the": 1,
    " The debate that has been going on here.": 1,
    " versus private sector, aid versus trade, et cetera.": 1,
    "And as someone stood up to say, one of the frustrating things is that it's been a simplistic debate.": 1,
    " And that's not what the debate should be about.": 1,
    "That's engaging in the wrong debate.": 1,
    "The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government, donors, the private sector, and ordinary African people?": 1,
    " taking charge of their own lives.": 1,
    "How do we combine all this?": 1,
    " to move our continent forward to do the things that need doing that I talked about, getting young people employed.": 1,
    " getting the creative juices flowing on this continent much of what you have seen here.": 1,
    "So I'm afraid we've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate and we need to bring it back to say what is the combination of all these factors that is going to yield": 1,
    " what we want.": 1,
    " I want to tell you something.": 1,
    "For me, the issue about aid, I don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid.": 1,
    "Africa has been given the other country's aid.": 1,
    " Mo Ibrahim said at a debate that he dreams one day when Africa will be given aid.": 1,
    "And I said, Mo, you're right.": 1,
    " No, but we've already been doing it.": 1,
    "The UK and the US could not have been built today without Africa's aid.": 1,
    " It is all the resources that we are taking from Africa, including humans, that build these countries today.": 1,
    " So when they try to give back, we shouldn't be on the defensive.": 1,
    " The issue is not that.": 1,
    "The issue is how are we using what has been given, what is being given back?": 1,
    "How are we using it?": 1,
    "Is it being directed effectively?": 1,
    " I want to tell you a little story why I don't mind if we get aid but we use it well.": 1,
    " from 19.": 1,
    " 67 to 70, Nigeria fought a war, the Nigeria-Biafra war.": 1,
    " And in the middle of that war, I was 14 years old.": 1,
    "We spent much of our time with my mother cooking for the army.": 1,
    "My father joined the army as a brigadier, the Biafran army.": 1,
    "We were on the Biafran side.": 1,
    " And we were down to eating one meal a day, running from place to place, but wherever we could help, we did.": 1,
    "At a certain point in time in 1969.": 1,
    " Things were really bad.": 1,
    "We were down to almost nothing in terms of Emile.": 1,
    "The people, children were dying of Kwashioko.": 1,
    "I'm sure some of you who are not so young will remember those pictures.": 1,
    " Well, I was in the middle of it.": 1,
    "In the midst of all this my mother fell ill.": 1,
    " with a stomach ailment for two or three days.": 1,
    "We thought she was going to die.": 1,
    "My father was not there.": 1,
    "He was in the army.": 1,
    "So I was the oldest person in the house.": 1,
    "My sister felt very ill.": 1,
    " with malaria.": 1,
    "She was three years old.": 1,
    " And I was 15.": 1,
    " and she had such a high fever.": 1,
    "We tried everything.": 1,
    "It didn't look like it was going to work until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor.": 1,
    " who was able, who was looking at people and giving them medicine.": 1,
    "I put my sister on my back, burning, and I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back.": 1,
    "It was really hot.": 1,
    "I was very hungry.": 1,
    " I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman.": 1,
    "We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people.": 1,
    "I walked 10 kilometers, putting one foot in front of the other.": 1,
    "I got there and I saw huge crowds.": 1,
    " Almost a thousand people were there trying to break down the door.": 1,
    "She was doing this in a church How was I going to get in?": 1,
    " I had to crawl in between the legs of these people with my sister strapped on my back, find a way to a window and whilst they were trying to break down the door, I climbed in through the window and jumped in.": 1,
    " This woman told me it was in the nick of time.": 1,
    "By the time we jumped into that hole, she was barely moving.": 1,
    " She gave her a shot of chloroquine, what I learned was the chloroquine then, gave her some, it must have been a rehydration and some other therapies and put us in a corner.": 1,
    " In about two to three hours, she started to move.": 1,
    " and then they toweled her down because she started sweating which was a good sign.": 1,
    " And then my sister woke up.": 1,
    " And about five or six hours later, she said we could go home.": 1,
    "I strapped her on my back.": 1,
    "I walked 10 kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had.": 1,
    "I was so happy.": 1,
    " that my sister was alive.": 1,
    "Today she's 41 years old, a mother of three, and she's a physician saving other lives.": 1,
    " Why am I telling that?": 1,
    "I'm telling you that because when it is you or your person involved, you don't care whether it's aid,": 1,
    " Or do you don't care what it is?": 1,
    " You just want the person to be alive.": 1,
    " And now let me become less sentimental and say that saving lives, which some of the aid we get, does on this continent.": 1,
    "When you save the life of anyone, a farmer, a teacher, a mother, they are contributing productively into the economy.": 1,
    " and as an economist.": 1,
    " We can also look at that side of the story.": 1,
    "These are people who are productive agents in the economy.": 1,
    "So if we save people from HIV AIDS, if we save them from malaria, it means they can form the base.": 1,
    " production for our economy and by the same token as someone said yesterday if we don't and they die their children will become a burden on the economy": 1,
    " So even from an economic standpoint, if we leave the social and humanitarian, we need to save lives now.": 1,
    "So that's one of the reasons from a personal experience that I say, look,": 1,
    " if let's channel these resources we get into something productive however": 1,
    " I will also tell you that I'm one of those who don't believe that this is the sole answer.": 1,
    "That's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated.": 1,
    " You know, we have to use it well.": 1,
    "What has happened in Europe?": 1,
    "Do you all know that Spain, part of the EU, got $10 billion in aid from the rest of the EU?": 1,
    " resources that were transferred to them at where they Spanish.": 1,
    " ashamed of this?": 1,
    "No.": 1,
    "The EU transferred 10 billion.": 1,
    "What did they use it as?": 1,
    "Have you been to southern Spain lately?": 1,
    "There are roads everywhere, infrastructure everywhere.": 1,
    " It is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain has developed into a services economy.": 1,
    "Did you know that Ireland got three billion dollars in aid?": 1,
    " Ireland is one of the fastest growing economies in the European Union today, for which many people, even from other parts of the world, are going there to find jobs.": 1,
    "What did they do with the $3 billion they need?": 1,
    "They used it to build an information": 1,
    " Superhighway gain infrastructure that enables them to participate in the information technology revolution and to create jobs in their economy.": 1,
    " They didn't say no, we are not going to take this.": 1,
    "Today the European Union is busy transferring it.": 1,
    "My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain, which is roads,": 1,
    " highways, other things, and they can build ICT.": 1,
    "Why do they refuse to use the same way to build the same infrastructure in our countries?": 1,
    " when we ask them and tell them what we need.": 1,
    "One of my worries today is that we have many foundations now.": 1,
    "Now we talk about the World Bank IMF and Accountability and all that and the EU.": 1,
    "We also have": 1,
    " private citizens now who have a lot of money some of them in this audience with private foundations and one day these foundations have so much money they will overtake the official aid that is being given": 1,
    " But I fear and I'm very grateful to all of them for what they are trying to do on the continent.": 1,
    "But I'm also worried.": 1,
    "I wake up with annoying in my belly.": 1,
    " because I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent.": 1,
    " and they are also going from country to country.": 1,
    " and many times trying to find what to do, but I'm not really sure that their assistance is also being channeled in the right way.": 1,
    " And many of them are not really familiar with the continent.": 1,
    "They are just discovering.": 1,
    "And many times I don't see Africans working with them.": 1,
    " They are just going alone.": 1,
    " And many times I get the impression they are not really even interested in hearing from Africans who might know.": 1,
    "They want to visit us, see what's happening on the ground and make a decision.": 1,
    "And now it may be being harsh.": 1,
    " But I worry because this money is so important.": 1,
    "Now, who are they accountable to?": 1,
    " Are we on their boards?": 1,
    "When they make decisions about where to channel money, are we there?": 1,
    "Will we make the same mistake that we made before?": 1,
    "Have our presidents and our leaders, everyone is talking about?": 1,
    "Have they ever called these people together and say, look,": 1,
    " you foundation and you foundation you have so much money we are grateful let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled and where this age should go have we done that": 1,
    " The answer is no.": 1,
    "And each one is making their own individual effort.": 1,
    "And then 10 years from now, billions would again have gone into Africa.": 1,
    " and we would still have the same problems.": 1,
    "This is what gives us the hopeless image.": 1,
    "Our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money, sit down.": 1,
    "And we don't do it because there are so many of us.": 1,
    "We don't coordinate.": 1,
    " We've not called the Bill Gates and the Soros and everybody else who is helping.": 1,
    " and say sit down, let's have a conference with you.": 1,
    "As a continent, here are our priorities.": 1,
    "Here is where we want you to channel this money.": 1,
    "Each one should not be an entrepreneur, going and finding what is best.": 1,
    "We are not trying to stop them.": 1,
    " at all but to help them help us better and what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this 10 years from now we will have the same story and we will be repeating the same things": 1,
    " So our problem right now is how can we leverage all this goodwill?": 1,
    " that is coming towards our way.": 1,
    "How can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations, with the international organizations, and with our private sector?": 1,
    " I firmly believe in that private sector thing too, but it cannot do it alone.": 1,
    "So there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work.": 1,
    "They said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas.": 1,
    " So why don't we think of using some of this aid?": 1,
    "Well, why don't we first say to those helping us, don't be shy about infrastructure.": 1,
    "That health that you're working in cannot be sustainable without infrastructure.": 1,
    " That education will work better if we've got electricity and rural roads and so on.": 1,
    "That agriculture will work better if there are rural roads to get the goods to market.": 1,
    "Don't be shy of it.": 1,
    " invest some of your resources in that too and then we can say that this is one combination of private international multilateral money": 1,
    " private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership.": 1,
    " so that aid can be a facilitator.": 1,
    "That is all aid can be.": 1,
    "Aid cannot solve our problems.": 1,
    "I'm firmly convinced about that.": 1,
    "But it can be catalytic.": 1,
    "And if we fail to use it as catalytic,": 1,
    " we would have failed.": 1,
    "One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now.": 1,
    "One of the reasons.": 1,
    " is not only just that, you know, these people are stupid and China is coming to take resources.": 1,
    "It's because there's a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese, if you tell them we need a road here.": 1,
    " They will help you build.": 1,
    "They don't shy away from infrastructure.": 1,
    "In fact, the Chinese Minister of Finance said to me when I asked him, what are we doing wrong in Nigeria?": 1,
    " he said there are two things you need only infrastructure infrastructure infrastructure and discipline you are on discipline": 1,
    " And I repeat it for the continent.": 1,
    "It's the same.": 1,
    "We need infrastructure and discipline.": 1,
    "So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that.": 1,
    " Now, I realize I'm not saying health and education, we can also provide that as well, but I'm saying it's not either or.": 1,
    "Let's see how it can be a facilitator in partnership.": 1,
    "One idea.": 1,
    "Second thing, for the private sector.": 1,
    " People are afraid to take risks on the continent.": 1,
    "Why can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanism to enable people to take risks?": 1,
    " And finally, because they are both standing, I'm out of time.": 1,
    "Am I out of time?": 1,
    "OK, so let me not forget my punch line.": 1,
    "One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is to support women to create jobs.": 1,
    " A lot has been said here about women.": 1,
    "I don't need to repeat it.": 1,
    "But there are people, women, creating jobs.": 1,
    "And we know, studies have shown that when you put resources in the hand of the woman, in fact there's an econometric study in the World Bank Review done in 2000,": 1,
    " showing that transfers into the hands of women result in healthier children, more for the household, more for the economy and all that.": 1,
    "So I'm saying that one of the takeaways from here today, I'm not saying the men are not important, obviously, if you leave the husbands out,": 1,
    " They will come back home and get disgruntled and it will result in difficulties we don't want.": 1,
    "We don't want men beating their wives because they don't have a job and so on.": 1,
    "But at the margin, we also, I want to push this because": 1,
    " The reason is the men automatically get more support.": 1,
    "But I want you to realize that resources in the hands of African women is a powerful tool.": 1,
    " There are people creating jobs.": 1,
    "Beatrice Gargouva has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda.": 1,
    " We have Billy Awosika in Nigeria with the furniture, the chair company she wants to expand.": 1,
    "She needs another 20 million.": 1,
    "She will create another 100 to 200 more jobs.": 1,
    " So take away from here is how are you going to put together the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle who are already business people who want to expand and create more jobs.": 1,
    "And lastly,": 1,
    " What are you going to do to be part of this partnership?": 1,
    " of aid, government, private sector and the African as an individual.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " Bravo!": 1
