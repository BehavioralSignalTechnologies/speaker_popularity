    " I'm going to speak about a tiny little idea.": 1,
    " And this is about shifting baseline.": 1,
    "And because the idea can be explained in one minute, I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time.": 1,
    " And the first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.": 1,
    "And he was here, as you well know, in 35.": 1,
    "And you think he was chasing finches, but he wasn't.": 1,
    " he was actually collecting fish, and he described one of them": 1,
    " as very common.": 1,
    "This was the Selphine grouper.": 1,
    "A big fishery was run on it until the 80s.": 1,
    "Now the fish is on a Eucine red list.": 1,
    " Now, this story is, we have heard it lots of time, Pugalapagos, other places, so there is nothing particular about it.": 1,
    " But the point is we still come to Galapagos.": 1,
    "We still think it is pristine.": 1,
    "The brochures still say it is untouched.": 1,
    "So what happens here?": 1,
    " The second story also illustrates another concept.": 1,
    "It's called shifting waistline.": 1,
    " I was there in 71 studying a little girl named West Africa.": 1,
    "I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted to later to work in Africa.": 1,
    " and I thought I could blend in.": 1,
    "I got a big sunburn and I was convinced that I was really not from there.": 1,
    "This was my first sunburn.": 1,
    "And the lagoon was surrounded by": 1,
    " by palm trees, as you can see, and a few mangroves.": 1,
    "And it had tilapia, about 20 centimeters, a species of tilapia called black-chain tilapia.": 1,
    " And the fisheries for this tilapia sustained a lot of fishers and they had a good time and they earned more than average in Ghana.": 1,
    " And I went there 27 years later.": 1,
    "The fish had shrunk to half of their size.": 1,
    "They were maturing at five centimeters.": 1,
    "They had been pushed genetically.": 1,
    "They were still fishes.": 1,
    "They were still kind of happy.": 1,
    " and the fish also were happy to be there.": 1,
    "So nothing has changed, but everything has changed.": 1,
    " My third little story is that I was accomplice in the introduction of trolling in Southeast Asia.": 1,
    " In the 70s, well beginning in the 60s, Europe did lots of development projects.": 1,
    "Fisheries development meant imposing": 1,
    " on countries that had already 100,000 fisher to impose on them on industrial fishing.": 1,
    " quite ugly, it's called the Mutiara 4, and they went sailing on it, and we did surveys throughout the southern Charlestown Sea, and especially the Java Sea.": 1,
    " And what we caught, we didn't have words for it.": 1,
    " What we caught, I know now, is the bottom of the sea.": 1,
    "And 90% of our catch was sponges, other animals that are fixed on the bottom.": 1,
    "And actually most of the fish": 1,
    " There are little spots on the debris, the piles of debris, where coral reef fish.": 1,
    "Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto deck and then was slowed down.": 1,
    "And these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid.": 1,
    " Within a year that you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins, the bottom is transformed from, in this case, a hard bottom or soft core into a muddy": 1,
    " mass.": 1,
    "This is a dead turtle.": 1,
    "They were not eaten.": 1,
    "They were thrown away because they were dead.": 1,
    "And one time we caught a live one.": 1,
    "It was not drowned yet.": 1,
    "And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat.": 1,
    "This mountain of": 1,
    " of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that has never fished, but it's not documented.": 1,
    " We transform the world but we don't remember it.": 1,
    "We adjust our baseline and to the new level and we don't": 1,
    " We don't recall what was there.": 1,
    "If you generalize this, something like this happened.": 1,
    "You have in the y-axis some good thing, biodiversity.": 1,
    " numbers of orca, the greenness of your country, the water supply, and over time it changes.": 1,
    "It changes because": 1,
    " People do things all naturally every generation will use the the images that they got at the beginning of the conscious lives": 1,
    " as a standard and will extrapolate forward and the difference then they perceive as a loss.": 1,
    "But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss.": 1,
    " You can have a succession of changes.": 1,
    "At the end, you want to sustain a miserable leftovers and that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now.": 1,
    "We want to sustain things": 1,
    " that are gone or things that are not the way they were.": 1,
    "Now one should think this problem affected people certainly when": 1,
    " In preliterate societies, they killed animals, and they didn't know they had done so after a few generations.": 1,
    "Because, obviously, an animal that": 1,
    " that is very abundant, before it gets extinct, it gets rare, it becomes rare.": 1,
    "So you don't lose abundant animals, you always lose rare animals.": 1,
    " And therefore, they are not perceived as a big loss.": 1,
    "Over time, we concentrate on large animals.": 1,
    " And in the sea, that means the big fish.": 1,
    "They become rarer because we fish them.": 1,
    "Over time, we have few fish left, and we think this is the baseline.": 1,
    "And the question is, why do we...": 1,
    " do people accept this?": 1,
    "Well, because they don't know that it was different.": 1,
    "And in fact, lots of people, scientists, will contest that it was really different.": 1,
    "And they will contest this because the evidence": 1,
    " presented in": 1,
    " in earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented.": 1,
    "For example, the anecdotes that some present": 1,
    " as a captain so and so observed lots of fish in this area is cannot be used or is usually not utilized by fisheries scientists because it's not scientific.": 1,
    " So you have a situation where people don't know the past and even though we live in little societies because they don't trust": 1,
    " the sources of the past.": 1,
    "And hence the enormous role that marine protected area can play.": 1,
    "Because with marine protected area, we actually": 1,
    " we recreate the past.": 1,
    "We recreate the past that people cannot conceive because the baseline has shifted and is extremely low.": 1,
    "That is for people who can see the marine protected areas.": 1,
    " a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides that it enables": 1,
    " which enables them to reset the baseline.": 1,
    "How about the people who can't do that because they have no access to people in the Midwest, for example?": 1,
    " And then I think, there I think that the arts and films can perhaps fill the gap.": 1,
    "And simulation.": 1,
    "This is a simulation": 1,
    " of Chesapeake Bay.": 1,
    "There were grey whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago, 500 years ago.": 1,
    "And you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like avatar.": 1,
    " And if you think of Avatar, if you think of why people were so touched by it, never mind the Pocahontas story.": 1,
    " Why so touched by the imagery?": 1,
    "Because it evokes something that the sense has been lost.": 1,
    " And so my recommendation, that's the only one I will provide, is to Cameron to do Avatar 2 underwater.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
