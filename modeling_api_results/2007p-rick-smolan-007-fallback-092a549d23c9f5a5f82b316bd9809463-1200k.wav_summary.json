    "I said, what?": 2,
    " Some of you have heard the story before, but in fact there's somebody in the audience who's never heard the story in front of an audience before.": 1,
    " I'm a little more nervous than I normally am telling the story.": 1,
    "I used to be a photographer for many years.": 1,
    "In 1978 I was working for Time Magazine and I was given a three-day assignment to photograph": 1,
    " Amor Asian children, children who had been fathered by American GIs all over Southeast Asia and then abandoned, 40,000 children all over Asia.": 1,
    " I'd never heard the word admiration before.": 1,
    "I spent a few days photographing children in different countries.": 1,
    "And like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists, I always hope that when my pictures are published,": 1,
    " they might actually have an effect on a situation instead of just documenting it.": 1,
    "So I was so disturbed by what I saw and I was so unhappy with the article that ran afterwards.": 1,
    " that I decided I would take six months off.": 1,
    "I was 28 years old.": 1,
    "I decided I would find six children in different countries and actually go spend some time with the kids and try to tell their story a little bit better than I thought I had done for Time Magazine.": 1,
    " In the course of doing the story, I was looking for...": 1,
    " I was looking for children who hadn't been photographed before and the Pearl Buck Foundation told me that they worked with a lot of Americans who were donating money to help some of these kids.": 1,
    " And a man told me who ran the Pearl Buck Foundation in Korea that there was a young girl who was 11 years old being raised by her grandmother, and the grandmother had never let any Westerners ever see her.": 1,
    "Every time any Westerners came to the village, she hid the girl.": 1,
    "And of course I was immediately intrigued.": 1,
    " I saw photographs of her and I thought I wanted to go and the guy just told me there's no way, this grandmother won't even, there's no way she's ever going to let you meet this girl that she's raising.": 1,
    "I took a translator with me.": 1,
    " I went to this village, found the grandmother, sat down with her, and to my astonishment, she agreed to let me photograph her granddaughter.": 1,
    "And I was paying for this myself, so I asked the translator,": 1,
    " It would be okay if I stayed for the week.": 1,
    "I had a sleeping bag.": 1,
    "The family had a small shed on the side of the house.": 1,
    "So I said, could I sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings?": 1,
    " I just told the little girl whose name was Unsook Lee that if I ever did anything to embarrass her, she didn't speak a word of English, although she looked very American.": 1,
    " She could just put up her hand and say, stop.": 1,
    "And I would stop taking pictures.": 1,
    "And then my translator left.": 1,
    "And so there I was.": 1,
    "I couldn't speak a word of Korean.": 1,
    "And this is the first night I met Minsook.": 1,
    "Her mother was still alive.": 1,
    "Her mother was not raising her.": 1,
    "Grandmother was raising her.": 1,
    " And what struck me immediately was how in love the two of these people were.": 1,
    "The grandmother was incredibly fond, deeply in love with this little girl.": 1,
    "They slept on the floor at night.": 1,
    "The way they heat their homes in Korea is to put bricks": 1,
    " under the floor, so the heat actually radiates from underneath the floor.": 1,
    "Eun-suk was 11 years old.": 1,
    "I had photographed, as I said, a lot of these kids.": 1,
    "Eun-suk was, in fact, the fifth child that I found to photograph in an almost...": 1,
    " Universally, amongst all the kids, they were really psychologically damaged by having been made fun of, ridiculed, picked on, and been rejected.": 1,
    "And Korea was probably the place I found to be the worst for these kids.": 1,
    "And what struck me immediately, in meeting Un Suk,": 1,
    " was how confident she appeared to be, how happy she seemed to be in her own skin.": 1,
    "And remember this picture, I'm going to show you another picture later, but you can see how much she looks like her grandmother, although she looks so Western.": 1,
    "I decided to follow her to school.": 1,
    "This is the first morning I stayed with her.": 1,
    "This is on the way to school.": 1,
    " This is the morning assembly outsider school.": 1,
    " And I noticed that she was clowning around.": 1,
    "When the teachers would ask questions, she'd be the first person to raise her hand.": 1,
    "Again, not at all shy or withdrawn or anything like the other children that I had photographed.": 1,
    "Again, the first one to go to the blackboard to answer questions.": 1,
    " getting in trouble for whispering into her best friend's ears in the middle of class.": 1,
    "And one of the other things I had said to her through the translator, again, this thing about saying stop, was to not pay attention to me.": 1,
    "So she really just completely ignored me most of the time.": 1,
    " I noticed that at recess she was the one, the girl who picked the other girls to be on her team.": 1,
    "It was very obvious from the very beginning that she was a leader.": 1,
    "This is on the way home.": 1,
    "And that's North Korea up along the hill.": 1,
    "This is up along the DMZ.": 1,
    "They would actually cover the windows every night.": 1,
    " so that light couldn't be seen because the South Korean government has said for years the North Koreans may invade at any time so there's always this...": 1,
    " The closer you were to North Korea, the more terrifying it was.": 1,
    "Very often at school, I'd be taking pictures and she would whisper into her girlfriend's ears and then look at me and say, stop.": 1,
    "And I would stand at attention and all the girls would crack up and it was sort of a little joke.": 1,
    " The end of the week came and my translator came back and I asked her to come back so I could formally thank the grandmother and Unsook.": 1,
    "And in the course of the grandmother talking to the translator, the grandmother started crying.": 1,
    "And I said to my translator, what's going on?": 1,
    "Why is she crying?": 1,
    " And she spoke to the grandmother for a moment.": 1,
    "And then she started getting tears in her eyes.": 1,
    "And I said, OK, what did I do?": 1,
    "What's going on?": 1,
    "Why is everyone crying?": 1,
    "And the translator said, the grandmother says that she thinks she's dying.": 1,
    "And she wants to know if you would take Eun-suk to America with you.": 1,
    " And I said, I'm 28 years old and I live in hotels and I'm not married.": 1,
    "I'd fallen in love with this girl, but emotionally I was about 12 years old.": 1,
    "If you know of photographers, it's...": 1,
    " The joke is it's the finest form of delayed adolescence ever invented.": 1,
    "Sorry, honey, you have to go on an assignment.": 1,
    "I'll be back, and then you never come back.": 1,
    " So I asked the translator why she thought she was dying.": 1,
    "Could I get her a hospital?": 1,
    "Could I get her a doctor?": 1,
    "And she refused any help at all.": 1,
    " And so when I got outside, I actually gave the translator some money and said, please go back and see if you can do something.": 1,
    "And I gave the grandmother my business card.": 1,
    "I said, if you're serious, I will try to find a family for her.": 1,
    "And I immediately wrote a letter to my best friends in Atlanta, Georgia, who had an 11 year old son.": 1,
    " and uh...": 1,
    " My best friend had mistakenly one day said something about wishing he had another child.": 1,
    "So here my friends Jean and Gail had not heard from me in about a year and I suddenly I was calling saying I'm in Korea and I met this extraordinary girl and": 1,
    " I said, the grandmother thinks she's sick, but I think maybe we would have to bring the grandmother over also.": 1,
    "And I said, I'll pay for the grant.": 1,
    "I mean, I had this whole sort of picture.": 1,
    "So anyway, I left.": 1,
    " My friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her and I said, look, I think I'll scare the grandmother to death if I actually write to her and tell her.": 1,
    " that you're willing to adopt her.": 1,
    "I want to go back and talk to her, but I was off on assignment.": 1,
    "I figured I'd come back in a couple of weeks and talk to the grandmother.": 1,
    "And on Christmas Day, I was in Bangkok with a group of photographers and got a telegram.": 1,
    "Back in those days, you got telegrams.": 1,
    " from Time magazine saying someone in Korea had died and left their child in a will to me.": 1,
    "Did I know anything about this?": 1,
    "Because I hadn't told them what I was doing because I was so upset with the story they'd run.": 1,
    " So I went back to Korea and I went back to Eunsook's village and she was gone.": 1,
    "And the house that I had spent time in was empty.": 1,
    "It was incredibly cold.": 1,
    " No one in the village would tell me where Unsuk was because the grandmother had always hidden her from Westerners and they had no idea about this request that she'd made of me.": 1,
    " So I finally found Myung-sun, her best friend that she used to play with after school every day.": 1,
    "And Myung-sun, under some pressure from me and the translator, gave us an address on the outside of Seoul.": 1,
    " And I went to that address and knocked on the door and the man answered the door.": 1,
    "It was not a very nice area of Seoul.": 1,
    "There were mud streets outside of it.": 1,
    " I knocked on the door and Eun-sook answered the door and her eyes were bloodshot and she seemed to be in shock.": 1,
    "There was no recognition whatsoever.": 1,
    "And this man came to the door and kind of barked something in Korean and I said to the translator, what did he say?": 1,
    " And she said, he wants to know who you are.": 1,
    "I said, well, tell him that I am a photographer.": 1,
    "I started explaining who I was, and he interrupted.": 1,
    "And she said, he says he knows who you are.": 1,
    "What do you want?": 1,
    " I said, well, tell him that I was asked by this little girl's grandmother to find a family for her.": 1,
    "And he said, I'm her uncle.": 1,
    "She's fine.": 1,
    "You can leave now.": 1,
    "So I was.": 1,
    " The door is being slammed on my face.": 1,
    "It's incredibly cold.": 1,
    "And I'm trying to think, what would the hero do in a movie if I was writing this as a movie script?": 1,
    "So I said, listen, it's really cold.": 1,
    "I've come a very long way.": 1,
    "Do you mind if I just come in for a minute?": 1,
    "I'm freezing.": 1,
    " So the guy kind of reluctantly let us in and we sat down on the floor and as we started talking, I saw him yell something and once it came and brought us some food.": 1,
    " And I had this whole mental picture of sort of like Cinderella.": 1,
    "I sort of had this picture of this incredibly wonderful, bright, happy": 1,
    " little child who now appeared to be very withdrawn being enslaved by this family and I was really appalled and I couldn't figure what to do and the more I tried talking to him the less friendly he was getting.": 1,
    " So I finally decided, I said, look, this is all through the translator, because this is all, you know, I don't speak a word of Korean.": 1,
    "And I said, look, I'm really glad that": 1,
    " I was very worried about her.": 1,
    "I made a promise to her grandmother, your mother, that I would find a family.": 1,
    "And now I'm so happy you're going to take care of her.": 1,
    "I bought an airline ticket.": 1,
    "I'm stuck here for a week.": 1,
    " And I said, I'm staying at a hotel downtown.": 1,
    "Would you like to come have lunch tomorrow?": 1,
    " And you can practice your English because he told me, I was trying to ask him questions about himself.": 1,
    "And so I went to the hotel and I found two older Amerasians, a girl who": 1,
    " whose mother had been a prostitute, and she was a prostitute, and a boy who had been in and out of jail.": 1,
    "And I said to them, look, there's a little girl who has a tiny chance of getting out of here and going to America.": 1,
    "And I said, I don't know if it's the right decision or not.": 1,
    " But I would like you to come to lunch tomorrow and tell the uncle what it's like to walk down the street, what people say to you, what you do for a living.": 1,
    "And just, I want him to understand what happens if she stays here.": 1,
    " And I could be wrong, I don't know, but I wish you would come tomorrow.": 1,
    "These two came to lunch and we got thrown out of the restaurant.": 1,
    "They were yelling at him.": 1,
    "It got to be really ugly.": 1,
    "We went outside and he was just furious and I knew I had totally blown this whole thing.": 1,
    " Here I was again trying to figure out what to do.": 1,
    "And he started yelling at me and I said to the translator, okay, tell him to calm down.": 1,
    "What is he saying?": 1,
    "And she said, well, he's saying, who the hell are you to walk into my house?": 1,
    "Some rich American with your cameras around your neck.": 1,
    " accusing me of enslaving my niece.": 1,
    "This is my niece.": 1,
    "I love her.": 1,
    "She's my sister's daughter.": 1,
    "Who the hell are you to accuse me of something like this?": 1,
    "And I said, you know, look, I said,": 1,
    " You're absolutely right.": 1,
    "I don't pretend to understand what's going on here.": 1,
    "I said, all I know is I'm photographing a lot of these children.": 1,
    "And I said, I am in love with your grand, with your niece.": 1,
    "I think she's an incredibly special child.": 1,
    "And I said,": 1,
    " Look, I will fly my friends over here from the United States if you want to meet them to see if you approve of them.": 1,
    "I just think that what little I know about the situation, she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have.": 1,
    " So everyone told me afterwards that inviting the prospective parents over was again the stupidest thing I could have possibly done because who's ever good enough for your relative.": 1,
    "But he invited me to come to a ceremony they're having that day for her grandmother.": 1,
    " and they actually take items and clothing and photographs and they burn them as part of the ritual.": 1,
    " And you can see how different she looks just in three months.": 1,
    "This was now, I think, February, early February, and the pictures were before taken in September.": 1,
    " Well, there was an American Marino priest that I had met in the course of doing the story who had 75 children living in his house.": 1,
    "He had three women helping him take care of these kids.": 1,
    " And so I suggested the uncle we go down and meet Father Keane to find out how the adoption process worked because I wanted him to feel like this is all being done very much above board.": 1,
    "So this is on the way down to the orphanage.": 1,
    " This is Father King.": 1,
    "He's just a wonderful guy.": 1,
    " He had kids from all over Korea living there and he would find families for these kids.": 1,
    " This is a social worker interviewing.": 1,
    "I had always thought she was completely untouched by all of this because the grandmother to me appeared to be sort of the village wise woman in the": 1,
    " the person everybody throughout the day I noticed people kept coming to visit her grandmother and I always had this mental picture that even though they may have been one of the poor families in the village that that there was one of the most respected families in the village and I always felt that the grandmother had kind of demanded and insisted": 1,
    " that the villagers treat Uncuk with the same respect they treated her.": 1,
    " I went off on an assignment and came back a week later and Father Keen": 1,
    " He said, I've got to talk to you about Unsook.": 1,
    "And I said, oh God, now what?": 1,
    "And he takes me to his room, he closes the door, and he says, I have 75 children here in the orphanage.": 1,
    " and it's total bedlam and there's clothes and there's kids and you know there's three adults and 75 kids you can imagine.": 1,
    "And he said the second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids and she assigned one of the older kids to each of the younger kids.": 1,
    " And then she set up a work detail list of who cleaned the orphanage on what day.": 1,
    "And he said, she's telling me that I'm messy and I have to clean up my room.": 1,
    "And he said, I don't know who raised her, but he said, she's running the orphanage and she's been here three days.": 1,
    " This was movie day that she organized where all the kids went to the movies.": 1,
    " A lot of the kids that have been adopted actually wrote back to the other kids telling them what their life was like with their new family.": 1,
    "So it was a really big deal when the letters showed up.": 1,
    " This is a woman who is now working at the orphanage whose son had been adopted.": 1,
    " Jean and Gail started studying Korean the moment they got my first letter.": 1,
    "They really wanted to be able to welcome Eun-suk into their family.": 1,
    " And one of the things Fr.": 1,
    "Keane told me when I came back from one of these trips, Unsuk had chosen the name Natasha, which I understood was from her watching a Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon on the American Air Force Station.": 1,
    "It's maybe one of those myth buster things that we'll have to clear up.": 1,
    " up here in a minute.": 1,
    "So my friend Gene flew over with his son Tim.": 1,
    "Gail couldn't come.": 1,
    "And they spent a lot of time huddled over a dictionary.": 1,
    "And this was Gene showing the uncle where Atlanta was and the map where he lived.": 1,
    " This is the uncle signing the Adashin papers.": 1,
    "Now we went out to dinner that night to celebrate.": 1,
    "The uncle went back to his family and Natasha and Tim and Jean and I went out to dinner and Jean was showing Natasha how to use a knife and fork and then": 1,
    " Natasha was returning the utensil lessons.": 1,
    "We went back to our hotel room and Gene was showing Natasha also where Atlanta was.": 1,
    "This is the third night we're in Korea.": 1,
    "The first night": 1,
    " We've gotten a room for the kids right next to us.": 1,
    "I've been staying in this room for about three months.": 1,
    "It was a little 15-story Korean hotel.": 1,
    " So the second night, we didn't keep the kids' room, because we went down and slept on the floor with all the kids at the orphanage.": 1,
    "And the third night, we came back.": 1,
    "We'd just gone out to dinner.": 1,
    "We saw the pictures.": 1,
    " And we got to the front desk and the guy at the front desk said, there's no other free rooms on your floor tonight.": 1,
    "So if you want to put the kids' five floors below you, there's a room there.": 1,
    " And Gina and I looked at each other and said, yeah, we don't want two 11-year-olds five floors away.": 1,
    "So his son said, Dad, I have a sleeping bag.": 1,
    "I'll sleep on the floor.": 1,
    "And I said, yeah, I have one too.": 1,
    "So Tim and I slept on the floor.": 1,
    "Natasha got one bed.": 1,
    "Gene got the other.": 1,
    " Kids pass out.": 1,
    "It's been very exciting for three days.": 1,
    "We're laying in bed and Jean and I are talking about how cool we are.": 1,
    "We're saying, man, we're so great.": 1,
    "We saved this little girl's life.": 1,
    "We're just full of ourselves.": 1,
    " And we fall asleep, and I've been in this room for a couple of months now, and they always overheat the hotels in Korea terribly.": 1,
    "So during the day, I always left the window open.": 1,
    "And then at night, about midnight, they turn the heat off in the hotel.": 1,
    "So by 1 a.m.,": 1,
    " The whole room would be like 20 below zero and I'd get up.": 1,
    "I'd been doing this every night.": 1,
    "I'd been there.": 1,
    "So sure enough, it's one o'clock.": 1,
    "Room's freezing.": 1,
    "I go to close the window and I hear people shouting outside and I thought, oh, the bar's mess had just gotten out.": 1,
    " I don't speak Korean, but I'm hearing these voices and I'm not hearing anger, I'm hearing terror.": 1,
    "So I open the window and I look out and there's flames coming upside of our hotel.": 1,
    " And the hotel's on fire.": 1,
    "So I run over to Gene, and I wake him up, and I said, Gene, don't freak out.": 1,
    "I said, I think the hotel's on fire.": 1,
    "And now there's smoke and flames coming by our windows.": 1,
    "We're on the 11th floor.": 1,
    " So the two of us are just like, oh my god, oh my god.": 1,
    "So we're trying to get Natasha up and we can't talk to her.": 1,
    "And you know what kids are like when they've been asleep for like an hour?": 1,
    "It's like they took five valiums and it's all over the place.": 1,
    " We can't talk to him.": 1,
    "I remember his son in the LLB in boot laces.": 1,
    "We were trying to do up his laces.": 1,
    "So we try to get to the door and we run to the door and we open the door and it's like walking into a blast furnace.": 1,
    " There's people screaming, there's the sound of glass breaking, these weird thumps, and the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds, and Gene turns around and says,": 1,
    " We're not going to make it.\"": 1,
    "And he closes the door, and the whole room is now filled with smoke.": 1,
    "We're all choking, and there's smoke pouring through the vents, under the doors, there's people screaming.": 1,
    " It's just, I just remember this unbelievable, just utter chaos.": 1,
    "I remember sitting at the end of the bed and I was just so, I had two overwhelming feelings.": 1,
    "One was absolute terror.": 1,
    "It's like, oh, please God, I just want to wake up.": 1,
    "This has got to be a nightmare.": 1,
    "This can't be happening, please.": 1,
    " I just want to wake up.": 1,
    "It's got to be a nightmare.": 1,
    "And the other is unbelievable guilt.": 1,
    "Here I've been playing God with my friend's lives, my friend's son, with Natasha's life.": 1,
    "And this is what you get when you try playing God.": 1,
    " hurt people.": 1,
    "I remember just being so frightened and terrified, and Gene, who's laying on the floor, says, man, we've got to soak towels.": 1,
    "He says, we've got to soak towels.": 1,
    "We're going to die from the smoke.": 1,
    "So we ran to the bathroom.": 1,
    "We got towels and put them over our faces and the kids' faces.": 1,
    " And he said, do you have Gaffer's tape?": 1,
    "He said, do you have Gaffer's tape?": 1,
    "And I said, yeah, somewhere in my Halliburton.": 1,
    "He says, we've got to stop the smoke.": 1,
    "He said, that's all we can do.": 1,
    "We've got to stop the smoke.": 1,
    "I mean, Gene, thank God for Gene.": 1,
    " So we put the room service menus over the vents in the wall.": 1,
    "We put blankets at the bottom of the door.": 1,
    "We put the kids in the windowsill to try to get some air.": 1,
    " And there was a building, a new building going up that was being built right outside across the street from our hotel.": 1,
    "And there in the building were photographers waiting for people to jump.": 1,
    " Eleven people ended up dying in the fire.": 1,
    "Five people jumped and died.": 1,
    "Other people were killed by the smoke.": 1,
    " There's this loud thumping on the door after about 45 minutes and all this and people were shouting in Korean and I remember I": 1,
    " Natasha didn't want us opening the door or what?": 1,
    "No, that's right.": 1,
    "I was trying not to open the door because we'd spent so much time barricading the room and I didn't I didn't know who it was.": 1,
    "I didn't know what they wanted.": 1,
    "And Natasha could tell they were they were firemen trying to get us out.": 1,
    "I remember sort of a tussle at the door trying to get the door open.": 1,
    " In any case, 12 hours later, they put us in the lobby.": 1,
    "Gene ended up using his coat and his fist in the coat to break open a liquor cabinet.": 1,
    "People were lying on the floor.": 1,
