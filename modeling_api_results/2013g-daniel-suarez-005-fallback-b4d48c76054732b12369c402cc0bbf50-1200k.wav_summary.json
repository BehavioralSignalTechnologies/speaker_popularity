    " I write fiction, sci-fi thrillers.": 1,
    "So if I say killer robots, you probably think something like this.": 1,
    "But I'm actually not here to talk about fiction.": 1,
    "I'm here to talk about very real killer robots.": 1,
    " autonomous combat drones.": 1,
    " Now, I'm not referring to predator and reaper drones, whichever human making targeting decisions.": 1,
    "I'm talking about fully autonomous robotic weapons that make lethal decisions about human beings all on their own.": 1,
    " There's actually a technical term for this, lethal autonomy.": 1,
    " Now, lethally autonomous killer robots would take many forms, flying, driving, or just lying in wait.": 1,
    "And actually, they're very quickly becoming a reality.": 1,
    " These are two automatic sniper stations currently deployed in the DMZ between North and South Korea.": 1,
    " Both of these machines are capable of automatically identifying a human target and firing on it.": 1,
    "The one on the left, at a distance of over a kilometer.": 1,
    " Now, in both cases, there's still a human in the loop to make that lethal firing decision.": 1,
    "But it's not a technological requirement.": 1,
    "It's a choice.": 1,
    " And it's that choice that I want to focus on.": 1,
    " Because as we migrate lethal decision-making from humans to software, we risk not only taking the humanity out of war, but also changing our social landscape entirely, far from the battlefield.": 1,
    " That's because the way humans resolve conflict shapes our social landscape.": 1,
    "And this has always been the case throughout history.": 1,
    "For example, these were state-of-the-art weapons systems in 1400 AD.": 1,
    " Now they were both very expensive to build and maintain, but with these you could dominate the populace.": 1,
    "And the distribution of political power in feudal society reflected that.": 1,
    "Power was focused at the very top.": 1,
    " from what changed technological innovation, gunpowder, cannon.": 1,
    "And pretty soon, armor and castles were obsolete.": 1,
    "And it mattered less who you brought to the battlefield versus how many people you brought to the battlefield.": 1,
    " And as armies grew in size, the nation state arose as a political and logistical requirement of defense.": 1,
    "And as leaders had to rely on more of their populace, they began to share power.": 1,
    "Representative government began to form.": 1,
    " So again, the tools we use to resolve conflict shape our social landscape.": 1,
    "Autonomous robotic weapons are such a tool.": 1,
    " except that by requiring very few people to go to war, they risk re-centralizing power into very few hands, possibly reversing a five-century trend toward democracy.": 1,
    " Now I think knowing this, we can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions, to do what humans do best, which is adapt.": 1,
    " But time is a factor.": 1,
    "Seventy nations are developing remotely piloted combat drones of their own.": 1,
    "And as you'll see, remotely piloted combat drones are the precursors to autonomous robotic weapons.": 1,
    " That's because once you've deployed remotely piloted drones, there are three powerful factors pushing decision-making away from humans and onto the weapon platform itself.": 1,
    "The first of these is the deluge of video that drones produce.": 1,
    " For example, in 2004, the US drone fleet produced a grand total of 71 hours of video surveillance for analysis.": 1,
    " By 2011, this had gone up to 300,000 hours, outstripping human ability to review it all.": 1,
    "But even that number is about to go up drastically.": 1,
    " The Pentagon's Gorgon, Stair and Argus programs will put up to 65 independently operated camera eyes on each drone platform.": 1,
    " And this would vastly outstrip human ability to review it.": 1,
    "And that means visual intelligence software will need to scan it for items of interest.": 1,
    " And that means very soon drones will tell humans what to look at, not the other way around.": 1,
    " But there's a second powerful incentive pushing decision-making away from humans and onto machines.": 1,
    "And that's electromagnetic jamming, severing the connection between the drone and its operator.": 1,
    " Now we saw an example of this in 2011 when an American RQ-170 sentinel drone got a bit confused over Iran due to a GPS spoofing attack.": 1,
    "But any remotely piloted drone is susceptible to this type of attack.": 1,
    " And that means drones will have to shoulder more decision making.": 1,
    " They'll know their mission objective.": 1,
    " and they'll react to new circumstances without human guidance.": 1,
    " They'll ignore external radio signals and send very few of their own, which brings us to really the third and most powerful incentive, pushing decision-making away from humans and onto weapons.": 1,
    " plausible deniability.": 1,
    " Now we live in a global economy.": 1,
    " High-tech manufacturing is occurring on most continents.": 1,
    " cyberespionage is spiriting away advanced designs to parts unknown.": 1,
    "And in that environment, it is very likely that a successful drone design will be knocked off in contract factories, proliferate in the gray market,": 1,
    " And in that situation, sifting through the wreckage of a suicide drone attack, it will be very difficult to say who sent that weapon.": 1,
    " This raises the very real possibility of anonymous war.": 1,
    " This could tilt the geopolitical balance on its head, make it very difficult for a nation to turn its firepower against an attacker.": 1,
    " And that could shift the balance in the 21st century away from defense and toward offense.": 1,
    "It could make military action a viable option, not just for small nations, but criminal organizations, private enterprise, even powerful individuals.": 1,
    " it could create a landscape of rival warlords undermining rule of law and civil society.": 1,
    " Now if responsibility and transparency are two of the cornerstones of representative government, autonomous robotic weapons could undermine both.": 1,
    " You might be thinking that citizens of high-tech nations would have the advantage in any robotic war, that citizens of those nations would be less vulnerable, particularly against developing nations.": 1,
    " But I think the truth is the exact opposite.": 1,
    " I think citizens of high-tech societies are more vulnerable to robotic weapons.": 1,
    "And the reason can be summed up in one word, data.": 1,
    " Data powers high-tech societies.": 1,
    "Cell phone geolocation, telecom metadata, social media email text, financial transaction data, transportation data.": 1,
    "It's a wealth of real-time data.": 1,
    " on the movements and social interactions of people.": 1,
    "In short, we are more visible to machines than any people in history.": 1,
    " And this perfectly suits the targeting needs of autonomous weapons.": 1,
    " What you're looking at here is a link analysis map of a social group.": 1,
    "Lines indicate social connectedness between individuals.": 1,
    "And these types of maps can be automatically generated based on the data trail modern people leave behind.": 1,
    " Now it's typically used to market goods and services to targeted demographics, but it's a dual-use technology.": 1,
    " because targeting is used in another context.": 1,
    "Notice that certain individuals are highlighted.": 1,
    "These are the hubs of social networks.": 1,
    "These are organizers, opinion makers, leaders.": 1,
    " And these people also can be automatically identified from their communication patterns.": 1,
    "Now, if you're a marketer, you might then target them with product samples.": 1,
    "Try to spread your brand through their social group.": 1,
    " But if you're a repressive government searching for political enemies, you might instead remove them.": 1,
    " eliminate them, disrupt their social group, and those who remain behind lose social cohesion and organization.": 1,
    " Now in a world of cheap proliferating robotic weapons, borders would offer very little protection to critics of distant governments or transnational criminal organizations.": 1,
    " popular movements agitating for change could be detected early and their leaders eliminated before their ideas achieve critical mass.": 1,
    " And ideas achieving critical mass is what political activism and popular government is all about.": 1,
    "Anonymous lethal weapons could make lethal action an easy choice for all sorts of competing interests.": 1,
    " And this would put a chill on free speech and popular political action, the very heart of democracy.": 1,
    " And this is why we need an international treaty on robotic weapons, and in particular a global ban on the development and deployment of killer robots.": 1,
    " Now, we already have international treaties on nuclear and biological weapons.": 1,
    "And while imperfect, these have largely worked.": 1,
    "But robotic weapons might be every bit as dangerous, because they will almost certainly be used.": 1,
    " and they would also be corrosive to our democratic institutions.": 1,
    " Now in November 2012, the US Department of Defense issued a directive requiring a human being be present in all lethal decisions.": 1,
    " this temporarily effectively banned autonomous weapons in the US military.": 1,
    "But that directive needs to be made permanent.": 1,
    " and it could set the stage for global action.": 1,
    " because we need an international legal framework for robotic weapons.": 1,
    " And we need it now before there's a devastating attack or a terrorist incident that causes nations of the world to rush to adopt these weapons before thinking through the consequences.": 1,
    " Autonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much power in too few hands.": 1,
    " and they would imperil democracy itself.": 1,
    " Now, don't get me wrong, I think there are tons of great uses for unarmed civilian drones.": 1,
    "Environmental monitoring, search and rescue, logistics.": 1,
    "If we have an international treaty on robotic weapons, how do we gain the benefits of autonomous": 1,
    " drones and vehicles while still protecting ourselves against illegal robotic weapons.": 1,
    " I think the secret will be transparency.": 1,
    " No robot should have an expectation of privacy in a public place.": 1,
    " Each robot and drone should have a cryptographically signed ID burned in at the factory that can be used to track its movement through public spaces.": 1,
    "We have license plates on cars, tail numbers on aircraft, this is no different.": 1,
    " And every citizen should be able to download an app that shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles moving through public spaces around them, both right now and historically.": 1,
    " And civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones to detect rogue drones.": 1,
    "And instead of sending killer drones of our own up to shoot them down,": 1,
    " they should notify humans to their presence.": 1,
    "And in certain very high security areas, perhaps civic drones would snare them and drag them off to a bomb disposal facility.": 1,
    "But notice, this is more an immune system.": 1,
    " than a weapon system.": 1,
    "It would allow us to avail ourselves of the use of autonomous vehicles and drones while still preserving our open civil society.": 1,
    " We must ban the deployment and development of killer robots.": 1,
    "Let's not succumb to the temptation to automate war.": 1,
    " Autocratic governments and criminal organizations undoubtedly will, but let's not join them.": 1,
    "Autonomous robotic weapons would concentrate too much power in too few unseen hands, and that would be corrosive to representative government.": 1,
    " Let's make sure, for democracies at least, killer robots remain fiction.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
