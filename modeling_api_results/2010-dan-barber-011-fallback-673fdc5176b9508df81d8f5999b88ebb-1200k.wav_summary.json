    " So I've known a lot of fish in my life.": 1,
    " I've loved only two.": 1,
    " That first one was more like a passionate affair.": 1,
    "It was a beautiful fish.": 1,
    "Flavorful, textured, meaty.": 1,
    "The best seller on the menu.": 1,
    " What a fish.": 1,
    " Even better.": 1,
    " It was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability.": 1,
    " so you can feel good about selling it.": 1,
    " I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months.": 1,
    " One day, the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm's sustainability.": 1,
    "Absolutely, I said.": 1,
    " Here's a company trying to solve what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs.": 1,
    " How do we keep fish on our menus?": 1,
    " For the past 50 years,": 1,
    " We've been fishing the seas like we clear cut forests.": 1,
    " It's hard to overstate the destruction.": 1,
    " 90% of large fish, the ones we love, the tunas, the halibuts, the salmons, swordfish, have collapsed.": 1,
    " of the world.": 1,
    " So for better or for worse, aquaculture, fish farming, is going to be a part of our future.": 1,
    "A lot of arguments against it.": 1,
    "Fish farms pollute.": 1,
    "Most of them do anyway.": 1,
    "And they're inefficient.": 1,
    "Take tuna, a major drawback.": 1,
    " It's got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one.": 1,
    "That means it takes 15 pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna.": 1,
    " not very sustainable.": 1,
    "It doesn't taste very good either.": 1,
    " So here, finally, was a company trying to do it right.": 1,
    "I wanted to support them.": 1,
    " The day before the event, I called the head of PR for the company.": 1,
    " Let's call him Don.": 1,
    " Don, I said, just to get the facts straight, you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea, you don't pollute.": 1,
    "That's right, he said.": 1,
    "We're so far out, the waste from our fish gets distributed, not concentrated.": 1,
    " And then he added, we're basically a world unto ourselves.": 1,
    " A feed conversion ratio?": 1,
    "2.5 to 1 he said, best in the business.": 1,
    " 2.5 to 1, great.": 1,
    "2.5, what?": 1,
    "What are you feeding?": 1,
    "Sustainable proteins, he said.": 1,
    " Great, I said.": 1,
    "Got off the phone.": 1,
    "And that night I was lying in bed and I thought, what the hell is a sustainable protein?": 1,
    " So the next day, just before the event, I called Don.": 1,
    "I said, Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins?": 1,
    "He said he didn't know.": 1,
    " He would ask around.": 1,
    "Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the company.": 1,
    "No one could give me a straight answer.": 1,
    " Until finally, I got on the phone with the head biologist.": 1,
    " Let's call him Don too.": 1,
    " Don, I said, what are some examples of sustainable proteins?": 1,
    "Well, he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals.": 1,
    "And then he said chicken pellets.": 1,
    " I said, chicken pellets.": 1,
    "He said, yeah, feathers, skin, bone meal, scraps dried and processed into feed.": 1,
    "I said, what percentage of your feed is chicken?": 1,
    " thinking, you know, 2%.": 1,
    "Oh, it's about 30%, he said.": 1,
    " I said, Don, what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish?": 1,
    " There is a long pause on the line.": 1,
    " And he said, there's just too much chicken in the world.": 1,
    " Okay, I fell out of love with this fish.": 1,
    " No, not because I'm some self-righteous goody-two-shoes foodie.": 1,
    " I actually am.": 1,
    " Now I fell out of love with this fish because I swear to God after that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken.": 1,
    " This second fish.": 1,
    " Well it's a different kind of love story.": 1,
    " It's the romantic kind.": 1,
    " The kind where the more you get to know your fish, you love the fish.": 1,
    " I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain.": 1,
    "A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time.": 1,
    "She kind of set us up.": 1,
    " It came to the table a bright, almost shimmering white color.": 1,
    " The chef had overcooked it.": 1,
    " Like twice over.": 1,
    " Amazingly, it was still delicious.": 1,
    " Who can make a fish taste good?": 1,
    " After it's been overcooked, I can't.": 1,
    " But this guy can.": 1,
    " Let's call him Miguel.": 1,
    "Actually, his name is Miguel.": 1,
    " And no, he didn't cook the fish and he's not a chef, at least in the way that you and I understand it.": 1,
    "He's a biologist.": 1,
    " at Veta La Pama.": 1,
    "It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain.": 1,
    "It's at the tip of the Guadalajara River.": 1,
    "Until the 1980s, the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians.": 1,
    " They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands.": 1,
    " They did it by draining the land.": 1,
    "They built this intricate series of canals and they pushed water off the land and out into the river.": 1,
    " Well, they couldn't make it work.": 1,
    "Not economically.": 1,
    "And ecologically, it was a disaster.": 1,
    "Killed like 90% of the birds, which for this place is a lot of birds.": 1,
    " And so in 1982, a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land.": 1,
    "What did they do?": 1,
    " They reversed the flow of water.": 1,
    "They literally flipped the switch.": 1,
    "Instead of pushing water out, they used the channels to pull water back in.": 1,
    "They flooded the canals.": 1,
    "They created a 27,000 acre fish farm.": 1,
    " bass mullet, shrimp eel.": 1,
    "And in the process, Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction.": 1,
    " The farm's incredible.": 1,
    "I mean, you've never seen anything like this.": 1,
    " You stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away, and all you see are flooded canals and this thick, rich marshland.": 1,
    " I was there not long ago with Miguel.": 1,
    " He's an amazing guy, like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee.": 1,
    "There we are, slogging through the wetland.": 1,
    " You know, I'm panting and sweating, I've got mud up to my knees, and Miguel is calmly conducting a biology lecture.": 1,
    "Here he's pointing out a rare black-shouldered kite.": 1,
    "Now he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton.": 1,
    "And here,": 1,
    " Here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian giraffe.": 1,
    " It turns out Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Makumi National Park in Africa.": 1,
    "I asked him how he became such an expert on fish.": 1,
    "He said, fish.": 1,
    " I didn't know anything about fish.": 1,
    "I'm an expert in relationships.": 1,
    "And then he's off.": 1,
    " launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants and don't get me wrong, I was really fascinated, you know, the biotic community unplugged kind of thing, you know, it's great.": 1,
    " But I was in love.": 1,
    "And my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before.": 1,
    "So I interrupted him.": 1,
    "I said, Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good?": 1,
    " You pointed at the algae.": 1,
    "I know, dude, the algae, the phytoplankton, the relationships, it's amazing.": 1,
    "But what are your fish eating?": 1,
    "What's the feed conversion ratio?": 1,
    " What goes on to tell me": 1,
    " It's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild.": 1,
    " The plant biomass, the phytoplankton, the zooplankton, it's what feeds the fish.": 1,
    "The system is so healthy, it's totally self-renewing.": 1,
    "There is no feed.": 1,
    " Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals?": 1,
    " Later that day, I was driving around this property with Miguel, and I asked him, I said, for a place that seems so natural, unlike any farm I'd ever been at, how do you measure success?": 1,
    " What that moment?": 1,
    "It's as if a film director called for a set change.": 1,
    "And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight.": 1,
    "Thousands and thousands of pink flamingos.": 1,
    " a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see.": 1,
    "That's success, he said.": 1,
    " Look at their bellies, pink!": 1,
    "They're feasting!": 1,
    " Feasting.": 1,
    "I was totally confused.": 1,
    "I said, Miguel, aren't they feasting on your fish?": 1,
    " Yes, he said.": 1,
    " We lose 20% of our fish and fish eggs to birds.": 1,
    " Last year this property had 600,000 birds on it.": 1,
    "More than 250 different species.": 1,
    "It's become today the largest and one of the most important": 1,
    " private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe.": 1,
    " I said Miguel, isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm?": 1,
    " He shook his head.": 1,
    "No, he said, we farm extensively, not intensively.": 1,
    " This is an ecological network.": 1,
    " The flamingos eat the shrimp, the shrimp eat the phytoplankton.": 1,
    "So the pinker the belly, the better the system.": 1,
    " Okay, so let's review.": 1,
    "A farm that doesn't feed its animals, and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators.": 1,
    "A fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary.": 1,
    " Oh, and by the way, those flamingos, they shouldn't even be there in the first place.": 1,
    "They brood in a town 150 miles away, where the soil conditions are better for building nests.": 1,
    " Every morning, they fly 150 miles into the farm.": 1,
    " and every evening they fly 150 miles back.": 1,
    " They do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway A92.": 1,
    " No kidding.": 1,
    " You know, I was imagining a March of the Penguins thing, you know?": 1,
    "So I looked at Miguel, I said, Miguel, do they fly 150 miles to the farm, and then do they fly 150 miles back at night, do they do that for the children?": 1,
    " He looked at me like I just quoted a Whitney Houston song.": 1,
    " He said, no, they do it because the food's better.": 1,
    " You know, I didn't mention the skin of my beloved.": 1,
    "Fish.": 1,
    " Which was delicious, and I don't like fish skin.": 1,
    "I don't like it seared.": 1,
    "I don't like it crispy.": 1,
    "It's that acrid, tar-like flavor.": 1,
    " I almost never cook with it.": 1,
    " Yet when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain, it tasted not at all like fish skin.": 1,
    " It tasted sweet and clean.": 1,
    " like you were taking a bite of the ocean.": 1,
    "I mentioned that to Miguel and he nodded.": 1,
    "He said, the skin acts like a sponge.": 1,
    "It's the last defense before anything enters the body.": 1,
    "It evolved to soak up impurities.": 1,
    "And then he added,": 1,
    " but our water has no impurities.": 1,
    " Okay, a farm that doesn't feed its fish.": 1,
    " a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators": 1,
    " And then I realized when he says a farm that has no impurities, he made a big understatement.": 1,
    "Because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalajara River.": 1,
    " It's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days, chemical contaminants, pesticide runoff.": 1,
    "And when it works its way through the system,": 1,
    " and leaves the water is cleaner than when it entered.": 1,
    "The system is so healthy, it purifies the water.": 1,
    " So not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals, not just a farm that measures the health, its success by the health of its predators, but a farm that's literally a water purification plant.": 1,
    " and not just for those fish.": 1,
    " but for you and me as well.": 1,
    "Because when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic.": 1,
    " drop in the ocean, I know, but I'll take it and so should you.": 1,
    " because this love story": 1,
    " however romantic, is also instructive.": 1,
    "You might say it's a recipe for the future of good food.": 1,
    " whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle.": 1,
    " What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture, one in which the food actually tastes good.": 1,
    " Right?": 1,
    " But for a lot of people, that's a bit too radical.": 1,
    " We're not realists, us foodies.": 1,
    "We're lovers.": 1,
    "We love farmers markets.": 1,
    "We love small family farms.": 1,
    "We talk about local food.": 1,
    "We eat organic.": 1,
    " And when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food, someone somewhere stands up and says, hey guy, I love pink flamingos.": 1,
    "But how are you going to feed the world?": 1,
    " How are you going to feed the world?": 1,
    " Can I be honest?": 1,
    "I don't love that question.": 1,
    " No, not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world.": 1,
    "One billion people will go hungry today.": 1,
    "One billion, that's more than ever before.": 1,
    " not tonnage.": 1,
    " Now I don't love this question because it's determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years.": 1,
    "Feed grain to herbivores, pesticides to monocultures, chemicals to soil, chicken to fish.": 1,
    " And all along, Agribusiness has simply asked,": 1,
    " If we're feeding more people more cheaply, how terrible could that be?": 1,
    " That's been the motivation.": 1,
    "It's been the justification.": 1,
    "It's been the business plan of American agriculture.": 1,
    "We should call it what it is.": 1,
    " a business in liquidation.": 1,
    " A business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible.": 1,
    "That's not a business.": 1,
    "And it is agriculture.": 1,
    " Our breadbasket is threatened today not because of diminishing supply, but because of diminishing resources.": 1,
    " not by the latest combine and tractor invention, but by fertile land.": 1,
    "Not by pumps, but by fresh water.": 1,
    " Not by chainsaws, but by forests.": 1,
    "And not by fishing boats and nets, but by fishing the sea.": 1,
    "Wanna feed the world?": 1,
    "Let's start by asking, how are we gonna feed ourselves?": 1,
    " Or better, how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself?": 1,
    " To do that, don't look at the agribusiness model for the future.": 1,
    "It's really old and it's tired.": 1,
    "It's high on capital, chemistry and machines.": 1,
    "And it's never produced anything really good to eat.": 1,
    " Instead, let's look to the ecological model.": 1,
    "That's the one that relies on two billion years of on the job experience.": 1,
    " Look to Miguel, farmers like Miguel, farms that aren't worlds unto themselves.": 1,
    " farms that": 1,
    " Restore, instead of deplete, farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively.": 1,
    "Farmers that are not just producers, but experts in relationships.": 1,
    "Because they're the ones that are experts in flavor, too.": 1,
    " And if I'm gonna be really honest, they're a better chef than I'll ever be.": 1,
    " You know I'm okay with that?": 1,
    "Because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
