    " But here's the thing.": 2,
    " When I was born, there was really only one book about how to raise your children, and it was written by Dr. Spock.": 1,
    " Thank you for indulging me.": 1,
    "I've always wanted to do that.": 1,
    " No, it was Benjamin's book, and his book was called The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care.": 1,
    "It sold almost 50 million copies by the time he died.": 1,
    " Today, I, as the mother of a six-year-old, walk into Martin's Noble and see this.": 1,
    "And it is amazing the variety that one finds on their shelves.": 1,
    " There are guides to raising an eco-friendly kid, a gluten-free kid, a disease-proof kid, which, if you ask me, is a little bit creepy.": 1,
    " There are guides to raising a bilingual kid, even if you only speak one language at home.": 1,
    " There are guides to raising a financially savvy kid and a science-minded kid and a kid who is a whiz at yoga.": 1,
    " Short of teaching your toddler how to defuse a nuclear bomb, there is pretty much a guide to everything.": 1,
    " All of these books are well-intentioned.": 1,
    "I am sure that many of them are great.": 1,
    " But taken together, I am sorry.": 1,
    "I do not see help when I look at that shelf.": 1,
    " I see anxiety.": 1,
    " I see a giant candy-colored monument to our collective panic.": 1,
    " And it makes me want to know, why is it that raising our children is associated with so much anguish and so much confusion?": 1,
    " Why is it that we are at sixes and sevens about the one thing human beings have been doing successfully for millennia, long before parenting message boards and peer-reviewed studies came along?": 1,
    " Why is it that so many mothers and fathers experience parenthood as a kind of crisis?": 1,
    " Crisis might seem like a strong word, but there's data suggesting it probably isn't.": 1,
    "There was, in fact, a paper of just this very name, Parenthood as Crisis, published in 1957.": 1,
    "And in the 50-plus years since,": 1,
    " there has been plenty of scholarship documenting a pretty clear pattern of parental anguish.": 1,
    " Parents experience more stress than non-parents.": 1,
    "Their marital satisfaction is lower.": 1,
    "There have been a number of studies looking at how parents feel when they are spending time with their kids, and the answer often is not so great.": 1,
    " Last year, I spoke with a researcher named Matthew Killingsworth who is doing a very, very imaginative project that tracks people's happiness.": 1,
    "And here is what he told me he found.": 1,
    " Interacting with your friends is better than interacting with your spouse.": 1,
    " which is better than interacting with other relatives.": 1,
    " which is better than interacting with acquaintances, which is better than interacting with parents, which is better than interacting with children.": 1,
    " who are on par with strangers.": 1,
    " I have been looking at what underlies these data for three years.": 1,
    "And children are not the problem.": 1,
    "Something about parenting right now, at this moment, is the problem.": 1,
    " Specifically, I don't think we know what parenting is supposed to be.": 1,
    "Parent, as a verb, only entered common usage in 1970.": 1,
    " Our roles as mothers and fathers have changed.": 1,
    "The roles of our children have changed.": 1,
    "We are all now furiously improvising our way through a situation for which there is no script.": 1,
    " And if you're an amazing jazz musician, then improv is great.": 1,
    "But for the rest of us, it can kind of feel like a crisis.": 1,
    " So, how did we get here?": 1,
    "How is it that we are all now navigating a child-rearing universe without any norms to guide us?": 1,
    " Well, for starters, there's been a major historical change.": 1,
    "Until fairly recently, kids worked on our farms primarily, but also in factories, mills, mines.": 1,
    "Kids were considered economic assets.": 1,
    " Sometime during the progressive era, we put an end to this arrangement.": 1,
    "We recognized kids had rights, we banned child labor, we focused on education instead, and school became a child's new work.": 1,
    "And thank God it did.": 1,
    " But that only made a parent's role more confusing in a way.": 1,
    "The old arrangement might not have been particularly ethical, but it was reciprocal.": 1,
    "We provided food, clothing, shelter and moral instruction to our kids, and they, in return,": 1,
    " provided income.": 1,
    " Once kids stopped working, the economics of parenting changed.": 1,
    "Kids became, in the words of one brilliant if totally ruthless sociologist, economically worthless but emotionally priceless.": 1,
    " Rather than them working for us, we began to work for them.": 1,
    "Because within only a matter of decades, it became clear.": 1,
    "If we wanted our kids to succeed, school was not enough.": 1,
    " Today, extracurricular activities are a kid's new work.": 1,
    "But that's work for us, too, because we are the ones driving them to soccer practice.": 1,
    " Massive piles of homework are a kid's new work.": 1,
    "But that's also work for us because we have to check it.": 1,
    "About three years ago, a Texas woman told something to me that totally broke my heart.": 1,
    " She said, almost casually, homework is the new dinner.": 1,
    " The middle class now pours all of its time and energy and resources into its kids, even though the middle class has less and less of those things to give.": 1,
    " Mothers now spend more time with their children than they did in 1965, when most women were not even in the workforce.": 1,
    " it would probably be easier for parents to do their new roles if they knew what they were preparing their kids for.": 1,
    "This is yet another thing that makes modern parenting so very confounding.": 1,
    " We have no clue what portion of our wisdom, if any, is of use to our kids.": 1,
    "The world is changing so rapidly, it's impossible to say.": 1,
    " This was true even when I was young.": 1,
    "When I was a kid, high school specifically, I was told that I would be at sea in the new global economy if I did not know Japanese.": 1,
    " And with all due respect to the Japanese, it didn't turn out that way.": 1,
    "Now there is a certain kind of middle-class parent that is obsessed with teaching their kids Mandarin.": 1,
    "And maybe they're on to something.": 1,
    " but we cannot know for sure.": 1,
    "So, absent being able to anticipate the future, what we all do as good parents": 1,
    " is try and prepare our kids for every possible kind of future, hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off.": 1,
    " We teach our kids chess, thinking maybe they will need analytical skills.": 1,
    "We sign them up for team sports, thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills.": 1,
    " you know, for when they go to Harvard Business School.": 1,
    "We try and teach them to be financially savvy and science-minded and eco-friendly and gluten-free.": 1,
    " Though now is probably a good time to tell you that I was not eco-friendly and gluten-free as a child.": 1,
    " I ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef.": 1,
    " And you know what?": 1,
    "I'm doing okay.": 1,
    "I pay my taxes.": 1,
    "I hold down a steady job.": 1,
    " I was even invited to speak a tad.": 1,
    " But the presumption now is that what was good enough for me or for my folks, for that matter, isn't good enough anymore.": 1,
    "So we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf.": 1,
    " because we feel like if we aren't trying everything, it's as if we're doing nothing.": 1,
    "And we're defaulting on our obligations to our kids.": 1,
    " So it's hard enough to navigate our new roles as mothers and fathers.": 1,
    "Now add to this problem something else.": 1,
    " We are also navigating new roles as husbands and wives because most women today are in the workforce.": 1,
    "This is another reason I think that parenthood feels like a crisis.": 1,
    " We have no rules, no scripts, no norms for what to do when a child comes along now that both mom and dad are breadwinners.": 1,
    " The writer Michael Lewis once put this very, very well.": 1,
    "He said that,": 1,
    " Because the conversation in the car on the way home goes something like this.": 1,
    " So...": 1,
    " Did you catch that Dave is the one who walks them to school every morning?": 1,
    " Without scripts telling us who does what in this brave new world, couples fight.": 1,
    "And both mothers and fathers each have their legitimate gripes.": 1,
    " Mothers are much more likely to be multitasking when they are at home, and fathers, when they are at home, are much more likely to be monotasking.": 1,
    " Find a guy at home, and odds are he is doing just one thing at a time.": 1,
    "In fact, UCLA recently did a study looking at the most common configuration of family members in middle-class homes.": 1,
    " Guess what it was.": 1,
    "Dad in a room by himself.": 1,
    " According to the American Time Youth Survey, mothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers, which is better than it was in Irma Bombeck's day.": 1,
    "But I still think that something she wrote is highly relevant.": 1,
    " I have not been alone in the bathroom since October.": 1,
    " Men are doing plenty.": 1,
    "They spend more time with their kids than their father's ever spent with them.": 1,
    " They work more paid hours on average than their wives, and they genuinely want to be good, involved dads.": 1,
    "Today, it is fathers, not mothers, who report the most work-life conflict.": 1,
    " Either way, by the way, if you think it's hard for traditional families to sort out these new roles, just imagine what it's like now for non-traditional families.": 1,
    " Families with two dads, families with two moms, single-parent households.": 1,
    "They are truly improvising as they go.": 1,
    " Now, in a more progressive country, and forgive me here for capitulating to clich\u00e9 and invoking, yes, Sweden, parents could rely on the state for support.": 1,
    " There are countries that acknowledge the anxieties and the changing roles of mothers and fathers.": 1,
    " Unfortunately, the United States is not one of them.": 1,
    "So in case you were wondering what the US has in common with Papua New Guinea and Liberia, it's this.": 1,
    " We too have no paid maternity leave policy.": 1,
    " We are one of eight known countries that does not.": 1,
    " In this age of intense confusion, there is just one goal upon which all parents can agree, and that is whether they are tiger moms or hippie moms, helicopters or drones.": 1,
    " Our kids' happiness is paramount.": 1,
    " That is what it means to raise kids in an age when they are economically worthless but emotionally priceless.": 1,
    " We are all the custodians of their self-esteem.": 1,
    "The one mantra no parent ever questions is, all I want is for my children to be happy.": 1,
    " And don't get me wrong, I think happiness is a wonderful goal for a child.": 1,
    "But it is a very elusive one.": 1,
    "Happiness and self-confidence": 1,
    " Teaching children that is not like teaching them how to plow a field.": 1,
    "It's not like teaching them how to ride a bike.": 1,
    "There's no curriculum for it.": 1,
    "Happiness and self-confidence can be the byproducts of other things, but they cannot really be goals unto themselves.": 1,
    " A child's happiness is a very unfair burden to place on a parent.": 1,
    " And happiness isn't even more unfair burden to place on a kid.": 1,
    " And I have to tell you, I think it leads to some very strange excesses.": 1,
    "We are now so anxious to protect our kids from the world's ugliness that we now shield them from Sesame Street.": 1,
    " I wish I could say I was kidding about this, but if you go out and you buy the first few episodes of Sesame Street on DVD, as I did, out of nostalgia, you will find a warning at the beginning": 1,
    " saying that the content is not suitable for children.": 1,
    " Can I just repeat that?": 1,
    "The content of the original Sesame Street is not suitable for children.": 1,
    " When asked about this by the New York Times, a producer for the show gave a variety of explanations.": 1,
    "One was that Cookie Monster smoked a pipe in one skit and then swallowed it.": 1,
    "Bad modeling, I don't know.": 1,
    "But the thing that stuck with me": 1,
    " is she said that she didn't know whether Oscar the Grouch could be invented today because he was too depressive.": 1,
    " I cannot tell you how much this distresses me.": 1,
    " You are looking at a woman who has a periodic table of the Muppets hanging from her cubicle wall.": 1,
    " The offending Muppet, right there.": 1,
    " That's my son.": 1,
    " the day he was born.": 1,
    "I was high as a chiton morphine.": 1,
    "I had had an unexpected desection.": 1,
    " But even in my opiate haze, I managed to have one very clear thought the first time I held him.": 1,
    " I whispered it into his ear.": 1,
    "I said,": 1,
    " I will try so hard not to hurt you.": 1,
    " It was the Hippocratic oath, and I didn't even know I was saying it.": 1,
    " But it occurs to me now that the Hippocratic oath is a much more realistic aim than happiness.": 1,
    " In fact, as any parent will tell you,": 1,
    " It's awfully hard.": 1,
    " All of us have said or done hurtful things that we wish to God we could take back.": 1,
    " I think in another era, we did not expect quite so much from ourselves.": 1,
    " And it is important that we all remember that the next time we are staring with our hearts racing at those bookshelves.": 1,
    " I'm not really sure how to create new norms for this world, but I do think that in our desperate quest to create happy kids, we may be assuming the wrong moral burden.": 1,
    " It strikes me as a better goal, and dare I say, a more virtuous one, to focus on making productive kids and moral kids, and to simply hope that happiness will come to them by virtue of": 1,
    " the good that they do and their accomplishments and the love that they feel from us.": 1,
    " That, anyway, is one response to having no script.": 1,
    " Absent having new scripts, we just follow the oldest ones in the book.": 1,
    " decency.": 1,
    " A work ethic.": 1,
    "Love.": 1,
    " and let happiness and self-esteem take care of themselves.": 1,
    " I think if we all did that...": 1,
    " the kids would still be all right.": 1,
    " and so would their parents.": 1,
    "Possibly in both cases, even better.": 1
