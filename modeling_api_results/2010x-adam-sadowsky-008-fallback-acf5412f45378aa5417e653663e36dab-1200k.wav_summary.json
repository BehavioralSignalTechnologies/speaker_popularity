    " Okay.": 2,
    "What what?": 2,
    " Hi there.": 1,
    "I'm going to be talking a little bit about music, machines, and life.": 1,
    "Or more specifically, what we learn from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video.": 1,
    " Some of you may recognize this image.": 1,
    "This is the opening frame of the video that we created.": 1,
    "We'll be showing the video at the end, but before we do, I want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted.": 1,
    "Now, when we first started talking to OK Go,": 1,
    " The name of the song is This Too Shall Pass.": 1,
    "We were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with.": 1,
    " And we were very excited about this because, of course, they have a history of dancing with machines.": 1,
    "They're responsible for this video.": 1,
    "Here it goes again.": 1,
    "50 million plus views on YouTube.": 1,
    " Four guys, trancing on treadmills, you know, no cuts, just a static camera, fantastically viral and wonderful video.": 1,
    "So we're really excited about working with them.": 1,
    " we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted, and they explained that they wanted kind of a Rube Goldberg machine.": 1,
    " For those of you who don't know, a Rube Goldberg machine is a complicated contraption, an incredibly over engineered piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task.": 1,
    " So we were excited by this idea and we started talking about exactly what it would look like and we came up with some parameters that": 1,
    " because building a Rube Goldberg machine has limitations, but it also is pretty wide open.": 1,
    "And we wanted to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video.": 1,
    " We came up with a list of requirements, the Ten Commandments, and they were in order of ascending difficulty.": 1,
    "The first is no magic.": 1,
    " Everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a typical viewer.": 1,
    "The rule of thumb was that if my mother couldn't understand it, then we couldn't use it in the video.": 1,
    " They wanted band integration, that is the machine acting upon the band members, specifically not the other way around.": 1,
    "They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling, so as the song picks up emotion,": 1,
    " so should the machine get grander in its process.": 1,
    "They wanted us to make use of a space.": 1,
    "So we had this 10,000 square foot warehouse we were using divided between two floors and included an exterior loading dock.": 1,
    " We used all of that, including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through.": 1,
    "They wanted it messy and we were happy to oblige.": 1,
    " The machine itself would start the music.": 1,
    "So the machine would get started, it would travel some distance reacting along the way, hit play on an iPod or a tape deck or something that would start playback.": 1,
    " and the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.": 1,
    "And speaking of synchronization, they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way.": 1,
    " They wanted it to end precisely on time.": 1,
    "Okay, so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect.": 1,
    "And they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point of the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song.": 1,
    " And as if that wasn't enough, all of these incredibly complicating things, right?": 1,
    "They wanted it in one shot.": 1,
    " So just some statistics about sort of what we went through in the process.": 1,
    "The machine itself has 89 distinct interactions.": 1,
    "It took us 85 takes.": 1,
    " to get it on film to our satisfaction.": 1,
    "Of those 85 takes, only three actually successfully completed their run.": 1,
    "We destroyed two pianos and ten televisions in the process.": 1,
    " We went to Home Depot well over 100 times.": 1,
    " And we lost one high-heeled shoe when one of our engineers, Heather Knight, left her high-heeled shoe after a nice dinner and returned back to the build.": 1,
    " and left it in a pile of stuff and another engineer thought well that would be a really good thing to use and ended up using it as a really nice trigger and it's actually in the machine.": 1,
    " So what did we learn from all of this?": 1,
    "Well, having completed this, we get the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things.": 1,
    "And we learned that small stuff stinks.": 1,
    " Little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust and they fall out of the tracks and the exact angles makes it hard to get right.": 1,
    " And yet a bowling ball will always follow the same path.": 1,
    "It doesn't matter what temperature it is.": 1,
    "It doesn't matter what's in its way.": 1,
    "It will pretty much get where it needs to go.": 1,
    " But as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start so that we would have somewhere to go.": 1,
    "And so you have to start with it.": 1,
    "You have to focus on it.": 1,
    "Small stuff stinks, but of course, it's essential, right?": 1,
    "What else?": 1,
    "Planning is incredibly important.": 1,
    " You know, we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things.": 1,
    "It's been said that no battle plan survives contact with the enemy.": 1,
    "I think our enemy was physics.": 1,
    " She's a cruel mistress, and often we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever.": 1,
    "And so while planning is important, so is flexibility.": 1,
    "These are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine.": 1,
    " So also put reliable stuff last.": 1,
    " The stuff that's going to run every time, right?": 1,
    "Again, small to large is relevant here.": 1,
    "The little Lego car in the beginning of the video references the big...": 1,
    " real car near the end of the video the big real car works every time there's no problem about it the little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and that's a problem so": 1,
    " But you don't want to have to reset the whole machine because the Lego car at the end doesn't work, right?": 1,
    "So you put that up front so that if it fails at least, you know, you don't have to reset the whole thing.": 1,
    "Life.": 1,
    " can be messy.": 1,
    " There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing.": 1,
    "Months were spent in this tiny, cold warehouse.": 1,
    "And the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it.": 1,
    "So it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad, this too shall pass.": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1,
    " And now to introduce their music video, we have OK Go.": 1,
    " Hello TEDxUSC, we are OK Go.": 1,
    "What are we doing?": 1,
    "Oh, just hanging out with our Grammy.": 1,
    "I think we could do better than this.": 1,
    " Hello, TedxUSC.": 1,
    "We are OK Go.": 1,
    "Have you read the natural curiosity cabinet?": 1,
    "I mean, curiosity, excuse me, cabinet of natural... Let's start again.": 1,
    "We need some more ridiculous things besides the cabinet of natural curiosities.": 1,
    "Do you have a pike, Damien?": 1,
    "Tim's sundial hat.": 1,
    " Have you seen the new work": 1,
    " Dogs.": 1,
    "Hello, 10x USC.": 1,
    "We are OK Go, and this is our new video.": 1,
    "This too shall pass.": 1,
    " Okay, we can still do one better, I think.": 1,
    " Get better.": 1,
    " I'm the right color": 1,
    " let it": 1
