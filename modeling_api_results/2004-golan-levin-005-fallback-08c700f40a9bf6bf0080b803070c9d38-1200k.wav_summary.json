    " Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories only to find out that you're a performance artist.": 1,
    " I'm also a software engineer and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer and I think the main thing that I'm interested in is trying to find a way of making the computer into a personal mode of expression.": 1,
    " Many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft, and in a way, those are my bane.": 1,
    "I think there's a great homogenizing force that software": 1,
    " imposes on people and limits the way they think about what's possible on the computer.": 1,
    "Of course there's also a great liberating force that makes possible, you know, publishing and so forth and standards and so on.": 1,
    " But in a way, the computer makes possible much more than what most people think.": 1,
    "And my art has just been about trying to find a personal way of using the computer.": 1,
    "And so I end up writing software to do that.": 1,
    " Chris has asked me to do a short performance and so I'm going to take just this time, maybe 10 minutes to do that and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form.": 1,

    "I did a performance with two singers who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths.": 1,
    " And this just came off last September at Ars Electronica.": 1,
    "We repeated it in England.": 1,
    "And the idea was to visualize their speech and song behind them with a large screen.": 1,
    "We used a computer vision tracking system in order to know where they were.": 1,
    " And so since we know where their heads are and we have a wireless mic on them that we're processing the sound from, we're able to create visualizations which are linked very tightly to what they're doing with their speech.": 1,
    "This will take about 30 seconds or so.": 1,
    " He's making a kind of cheek flapping sound.": 1,
    " Grrr.": 1,
    "Grrr.": 1,
    " Well, suffice it to say, it's not all like that, but it's part of it.": 1,
    "Thanks very much.": 1,
    "There's always lots more.": 1,
    "I'm over time.": 1,
    "So I just wanted to say, if you're in New York, you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week and also at Bitform's Gallery in Chelsea.": 1,
    "And with that, I think I should give up the stage.": 1,
    "So thank you so much.": 1
