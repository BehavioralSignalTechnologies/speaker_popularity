    " About 12 years ago, I gave up my career in banking to try to make the world a safer place.": 1,
    "This involved a journey into national and global advocacy and meeting some of the most extraordinary people in the world.": 1,
    " You're welcome.": 1,
    " In the process, I became a civil society diplomat.": 1,
    "Civil society diplomats do three things.": 1,
    " They voice the concern of the people, are not pinned down by national interests, and influence change through citizen networks, not only states ones.": 1,
    "And if we want to change the world, we need more of them.": 1,
    " But many people still ask, can civil society really make a big difference?": 1,
    "Can citizens influence and shape national and global policy?": 1,
    " I never thought I'd ask myself these questions, but here I am to share some lessons about two powerful civil society movements that I've been involved in.": 1,
    "They are niches that I'm passionate about.": 1,
    " gun control and drug policy.": 1,
    "And these are issues that matter here.": 1,
    "Latin America is ground zero for both of them.": 1,
    " For example, Brazil, this beautiful country hosting TED Global, has the world's ugliest record.": 1,
    "We are the number one champion in homicidal violence.": 1,
    " One in every 10 people killed around the world is a Brazilian.": 1,
    " This translates into over 56,000 people dying violently each year.": 1,
    "Most of them are young black boys dying by guns.": 1,
    " Brazil is also one of the world's largest consumers of drugs.": 1,
    " And the war on drugs has been especially painful here.": 1,
    "Around 50 percent of the homicides in the streets in Brazil are related to the war on drugs.": 1,
    " The same is true for about 25% of people in jail.": 1,
    "And it's not just Brazil that is affected by the twin problems of guns and drugs.": 1,
    "Virtually every country and city": 1,
    " across Central and South America is in trouble.": 1,
    " Latin America has nine percent of the world's population, but 25 percent of its global violent deaths.": 1,
    "These are not problems we can run away from.": 1,
    "I certainly could not.": 1,
    " So the first campaign I got involved with started here in 2003 to change Brazil's gun law and to create a program to buy back weapons.": 1,
    " In just a few years, we not only changed national legislation that made it much more difficult for civilians to buy a gun, but we collected and destroyed almost half a million weapons.": 1,
    " This was one of the biggest buyback programs in history.": 1,
    "But we also...": 1,
    " But we also suffered some setbacks.": 1,
    "We lost the referendum to ban gun sales to civilians in 2005.": 1,
    " The second initiative was also homegrown, but is today a global movement to reform the international drug control regime.": 1,
    " I'm the executive coordinator of something called the Global Commission on Drug Policy.": 1,
    "The commission is a high-level group of global leaders brought together to identify more humane": 1,
    " and effective approaches to the issue of drugs.": 1,
    "Since we started in 2008, the taboo on drugs is broken.": 1,
    "Across the Americas, from the US and Mexico to Colombia and Uruguay, change is in the air.": 1,
    " But rather than tell you the whole story about these two movements, I just want to share with you four key insights.": 1,
    "I call them lessons to change the world.": 1,
    " There are certainly many more, but these are the ones that stand out to me.": 1,
    " So the first lesson is change and control the narrative.": 1,
    "It may seem obvious, but a key ingredient to civil society diplomacy is first changing and then controlling the narrative.": 1,
    " This is something that veteran politicians understand, but that civil society groups generally do not do very well.": 1,
    " In the case of drug policy, our biggest success has been to change the discussion away from prosecuting or war on drugs to putting people's health and safety first.": 1,
    " In a cutting-edge report we just launched in New York, we also showed that the groups benefiting most from this $320 billion market are criminal gangs and cartels.": 1,
    " So in order to undermine the power and profit of these groups, we need to change the conversation.": 1,
    "We need to make illegal drugs.": 1,
    " legal.": 1,
    " But before getting you too excited, I don't mean drugs should be a free for all.": 1,
    "What I'm talking about and what the Global Commission advocates for is creating a highly regulated market": 1,
    " where different drugs would have different degrees of regulation.": 1,
    " As for gun control, we were successful in changing, but not so much in controlling the narrative.": 1,
    "And this brings me to my next lesson.": 1,
    " Never underestimate your opponents.": 1,
    "If you want to succeed in changing the world, you need to know who you're up against.": 1,
    "You need to learn their motivations and points of view.": 1,
    " In the case of gun control, we really underestimated our opponents.": 1,
    "After a very successful gun collection program, we were elated.": 1,
    " We had support from 80% of Brazilians and thought that this could help us win a referendum to ban gun sales to civilians.": 1,
    "But we were dead wrong.": 1,
    " During a televised 20-day public debate, our opponents used our own arguments against us.": 1,
    "We ended up losing the popular vote.": 1,
    "It was really terrible.": 1,
    " The National Rifle Association, yes, the American NRA, came to Brazil.": 1,
    " They inundated our campaign with their propaganda that, as you know, links the right to own guns to ideas of freedom and democracy.": 1,
    " They simply threw everything at us.": 1,
    "They used our national flag, our independence anthem, they evoked women's rights, and misused images of Mandela, Tiananmen Square, and even Hitler.": 1,
    " They won by playing with people's fears.": 1,
    "In fact, guns were almost completely ignored in their campaign.": 1,
    "Their focus was on individual rights.": 1,
    " But I ask you, which right is more important, the right to life or the right to have a gun that takes life away?": 1,
    " We thought people would vote in defense of life.": 1,
    " But in a country with a recent pest of military dictatorship, the anti-government message of our opponents resonated, and we were not prepared to respond.": 1,
    " Lesson learned.": 1,
    "We've been more successful in the case of drug policy.": 1,
    " If you ask most people 10 years ago if an end to the war on drugs was possible, they would have left.": 1,
    "After all, there are huge military, police, prison and financial establishments benefiting from this war.": 1,
    " But today, the international drug control regime is starting to crumble.": 1,
    "Governments and civil societies are experimenting with new approaches.": 1,
    " The Global Commission on Drug Policy really knew its opposition.": 1,
    "And rather than fighting them, our chair, former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, reached out to leaders from across the political spectrum,": 1,
    " from liberals to conservatives.": 1,
    "This high-level group agreed to honestly discuss the merits and flaws of drug policies.": 1,
    " It was this reasoned, informed and strategic discussion that revealed the sad truth about the one drugs.": 1,
    " The war on drugs has simply failed across every metric.": 1,
    "Drugs are cheaper and more available than ever, and consumption has risen globally.": 1,
    "But even worse.": 1,
    " it also generated massive negative unintended consequences.": 1,
    " It is true that some people have made these arguments before, but we've made a difference by anticipating the arguments of our opponents and by leveraging powerful voices that a few years ago would probably have resisted change.": 1,
    " Third lesson, use data to drive your argument.": 1,
    "Guns and drugs are emotive issues.": 1,
    "And as we've painfully learned in the gun referendum campaign in Brazil,": 1,
    " Sometimes it's impossible to cut through the emotions and get to the facts.": 1,
    "But this doesn't mean that we shouldn't try.": 1,
    " Until quite recently, we simply didn't know how many Brazilians were killed by guns.": 1,
    "Amazingly, it was a local soap opera called Mulheres Apaixonadas, or Women in Love,": 1,
    " that kicked off Brazil's national gun control campaign.": 1,
    "In one highly viewed episode, a soap opera lead actress was killed by a stray bullet.": 1,
    " Brazilian grannies and housewives were outraged, and in a case of art, imitating life.": 1,
    " This episode also included footage of a real gun control march that we had organized right here outside in Copacabana Beach.": 1,
    " The televised death in March had a huge impact on public opinion.": 1,
    "Within weeks, our national congress approved the disarmament bill that had been languishing for years.": 1,
    " We were then able to mobilize data to show the successful outcomes of the change in the law and gun collection program.": 1,
    " Here's what I mean.": 1,
    "We could prove that in just one year, we saved more than 5,000 lives.": 1,
    " And in the case of drugs, in order to undermine this fear and prejudice that surrounds the issue,": 1,
    " We've managed to gather and present data that shows that today's drug policies cause much more harm than drug use per se.": 1,
    "And people are starting to get it.": 1,
    " My fourth insight is don't be afraid to bring together odd, bad fellows.": 1,
    "What we've learned in Brazil, and this doesn't only apply to my country,": 1,
    " is the importance of bringing diverse and eclectic folks together.": 1,
    "If you want to change the world, it helps to have a good procession of society on your side.": 1,
    " In both the case of guns and drugs, we brought together a wonderful mix of people.": 1,
    "We mobilized the elite and got huge support from the media.": 1,
    "We gathered the victims, human rights champions, cultural icons.": 1,
    " We also assemble the professional classes, doctors, lawyers, academia and more.": 1,
    "What I've learned over the last years is that you need coalitions of the willing,": 1,
    " and of the unwilling to make change.": 1,
    "In the case of drugs, we need the libertarians, anti-prohibitionists, legalizers and liberal politicians.": 1,
    " They may not agree on everything.": 1,
    "In fact, they disagree on almost everything.": 1,
    "But the legitimacy of the campaign is based on their diverse points of view.": 1,
    " Over a decade ago, I had a comfortable future working for an investment bank.": 1,
    "I was as far removed from the world of civil society diplomacy as you can imagine.": 1,
    " But I took a chance.": 1,
    "I changed course.": 1,
    "And on the way, I helped to create social movements that I believe have made some parts of the world safer.": 1,
    " Each and every one of us has the power to change the world.": 1,
    " No matter what the issue, and no matter how hard the fight, civil society is central to the blueprint for change.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
