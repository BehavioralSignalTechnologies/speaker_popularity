    " I live in Washington, DC.": 1,
    " But I grew up in Sindhikala, a village in Orissa in India.": 1,
    " My father was a government worker.": 1,
    " My mother.": 1,
    " could not read or write, but she would say to me,": 1,
    " A king is worshipped only in his own kingdom.": 1,
    "A poet is respected everywhere.": 1,
    " So I wanted to be a poet when I grew up.": 1,
    " But I almost didn't go to college.": 1,
    " until an aunt offered financial help.": 1,
    " I went to study in Sambalpur, the largest town in the region, where already in college, I saw a television for the first time.": 1,
    " I had dreams of going to the United States for higher studies.": 1,
    " When the opportunity came, I crossed two oceans with borrowed money for airfare and only a $20 bill in my pocket.": 1,
    " in the U.S.": 1,
    " I worked in a research center part-time while taking graduate classes in economics, and": 1,
    " With the little I earned, I would finance myself and then I would send money home to my brother and my father.": 1,
    " My story is not unique.": 1,
    "There are millions of people who migrate each year.": 1,
    " With the help of the family, they cross oceans, they cross deserts, they cross rivers, they cross mountains.": 1,
    "They risk their lives.": 1,
    " to realize a dream, and that dream is as simple as having a decent job somewhere so they can send money home and help the family, which has helped them before.": 1,
    " There are 232 million international migrants in the world.": 1,
    "These are people who live in a country other than their country of birth.": 1,
    " If there was a country made up of only international migrants, that would be larger in population than Brazil.": 1,
    "That would be larger in its size of the economy than France.": 1,
    " Some 180 million of them from poor countries send money home regularly.": 1,
    "Those sums of money are called remittances.": 1,
    " Here is a fact that might surprise you.": 1,
    "$413 billion.": 1,
    "$413 billion was the amount of remittances sent last year by migrants to developing countries.": 1,
    " Migrants from developing countries, money sent to developing countries, $413 billion.": 1,
    "That's a remarkable number because that is three times the size of the total of development aid money.": 1,
    " And yet, you and I, my colleagues in Washington,": 1,
    " We endlessly debate and discuss about development aid while we ignore remittances as small change.": 1,
    "True, people send $200 per month on average, but": 1,
    " Repeated month after month, by millions of people, these sums of money add up to rivers of foreign currency.": 1,
    "So, India last year received $72 billion, larger than its IT exports.": 1,
    " In Egypt, remittances are three times the size of revenue from the Suez Canal.": 1,
    "In Tajikistan, remittances are 42% of GDP.": 1,
    " And in poorer countries, smaller countries, fragile countries, conflict-afflicted countries, remittances are a lifeline as in Somalia or in Haiti.": 1,
    " No wonder these flows have huge impacts on economies and on poor people.": 1,
    " Remittances, unlike private investment money, they don't flow back at the first sign of trouble in the country.": 1,
    "They actually act like an insurance.": 1,
    " When the family is in trouble, facing hardship, facing hard times, remittances increase.": 1,
    "They act like an insurance.": 1,
    "Migrants send more money then.": 1,
    " Unlike development aid money that must go through official agencies through governments, remittances directly reach the poor, reach the family, and often with business advice.": 1,
    "So, in Nepal,": 1,
    " The share of poor people was 42% in 1995, the share of poor people in the population.": 1,
    "By 2005, a decade later,": 1,
    " At a time of political crisis, economic crisis, the share of poor people went down to 31%.": 1,
    "That decline in poverty": 1,
    " Most of it, about half of it, is believed to be because of remittances from India, another poor country.": 1,
    " in El Salvador.": 1,
    " The school dropout rate among children is lower in families that receive remittances.": 1,
    "In Mexico and Sri Lanka, the birth weight of children is higher.": 1,
    " among families that receive remittances.": 1,
    " Remittances are dollars wrapped with care.": 1,
    "Migrants send money home for food, for buying necessities, for building houses, for funding education.": 1,
    " for funding health care for the elderly, for business investments for friends and family.": 1,
    "Migrants send even more money home for special occasions like surgery.": 1,
    " or a wedding, and migrants also send money, perhaps far too many times, for unexpected funerals that they cannot attend.": 1,
    " Much as these flows do all that good, there are barriers to these flows of remittances, this $400 billion of remittances.": 1,
    "Foremost among them is the exorbitant cost of sending money home.": 1,
    " money transfer companies structure their fees to milk the poor.": 1,
    "They would say, up to $500 if you want to send, we will charge you $30 fixed.": 1,
    " If you are poor and if you have only $200 to send, you have to pay that $30 fees.": 1,
    " The global average cost of sending money is 8%.": 1,
    "That means you send $100, the family on the other side receives only $92.": 1,
    "To send money to Africa, the cost is even higher.": 1,
    " 12%.": 1,
    "To send money within Africa, the cost is even higher, over 20%.": 1,
    "For example, sending money from Benin to Nigeria.": 1,
    " And then there is the case of Venezuela.": 1,
    " where because of exchange controls, you send $100 and you are lucky if the family on the other side receives even $10.": 1,
    " Of course, nobody sends money to Venezuela through the official channel.": 1,
    "It all goes in suitcases.": 1,
    "Wherever costs are high, money goes underground.": 1,
    " And what is worse, many developing countries actually have a blanket ban on sending money out of the country.": 1,
    "Many rich nations also have a blanket ban on sending money to specific countries.": 1,
    " So is it that there are no options, no better options, cheaper options to send money?": 1,
    "There are.": 1,
    "M-Pesa in Kenya enables people to send money and receive money at a fixed cost of only 60 cents per transaction.": 1,
    " US Fed started a program with Mexico to enable money service businesses to send money to Mexico for a fixed cost of only 67 cents per transaction.": 1,
    " And yet, these faster, cheaper, better options can't be applied internationally because of the fear of money laundering.": 1,
    " even though there is little data to support any connection, any significant connection between money laundering and the small remittance transactions.": 1,
    " Many international banks now are wary of hosting bank accounts of money service businesses, especially those serving Somalia.": 1,
    "Somalia.": 1,
    " a country where the per capita income is only $250.": 1,
    " per year, $250 per year.": 1,
    "Monthly remittances on average to Somalia is larger than that amount.": 1,
    " Remittances are the lifeblood of Somalia.": 1,
    "And yet, this is an example of the right hand giving a lot of aid, while the left hand is cutting the": 1,
    " lifeblood to that economy through regulations.": 1,
    " Then there is the case of poor people from villages like me.": 1,
    " in the villages, the only place where you can get money is through the post office.": 1,
    "Most of the governments in the world have": 1,
    " allowed their post offices to have exclusive partnership with money transfer companies.": 1,
    "So if I have to send money to my father in the village,": 1,
    " I must send money through that particular money transfer company, even if the cost is high.": 1,
    "I cannot go to a cheaper option.": 1,
    " This has to go.": 1,
    " So what can international organizations, social entrepreneurs do to reduce cost of sending money home?": 1,
    "First,": 1,
    " Relax regulations on small remittances under $1,000.": 1,
    "Governments should recognize that small remittances are not money laundering.": 1,
    " Second, governments should abolish exclusive partnership between their post office and the money transfer company, for that matter between the post office and any national banking system that has a large network that serves the poor.": 1,
    " In fact, they should promote competition, open up the partnership so that we will bring down costs like we did, like they did.": 1,
    " in the telecommunications industry.": 1,
    "You have seen what has happened there.": 1,
    " Non-profit philanthropic organizations should create a remittance platform on a non-profit basis.": 1,
    "They should create a non-profit remittance platform to serve the money transfer companies.": 1,
    " so that they can send money at a low cost while complying with all the complex regulations all over the world.": 1,
    " The development community should set a goal of reducing remittance costs to 1% from the current 8%.": 1,
    "If we reduce costs to 1%, that would release a saving of $30 billion per year.": 1,
    " $30 billion.": 1,
    " That's larger than the entire bilateral aid budget going to Africa per year.": 1,
    "That is larger than or almost similar to the total aid budget of the United States government, the largest donor in the planet.": 1,
    " Actually, the saving would be larger than that 30 billion because Remittance channels are also used for aid, trade, and investment purposes.": 1,
    " Another major impediment to the flow of remittances reaching the family is the large and exorbitant and illegal cost of recruitment.": 1,
    " Fees that migrant workers pay to labor agents who found them the job.": 1,
    " I was in Dubai a few years ago.": 1,
    "I visited a camp for workers.": 1,
    "It was eight in the evening, dark, hot, humid.": 1,
    " workers were coming back from their grueling day of work, and I struck a conversation with a Bangladeshi construction worker.": 1,
    " He was preoccupied that he is sending money home.": 1,
    "He has been sending money home for a few months now.": 1,
    "And the money is mostly going to the recruitment agent, the labor agent who found him that job.": 1,
    "And in my mind,": 1,
    " I could picture the wife waiting for the monthly remittance.": 1,
    "The remittance arrives.": 1,
    "She takes the money and hands it over to the recruitment agent.": 1,
    " while the children are looking on.": 1,
    "This has to stop.": 1,
    " It is not only": 1,
    " construction workers from Bangladesh, it is all the workers.": 1,
    "There are millions of migrant workers who suffer from this problem.": 1,
    " A construction worker from Bangladesh on an average pays about $4,000 in recruitment fees for a job that gives him only $2,000 per year in income.": 1,
    " That means that for the two years or three years of his life, he's basically sending money to pay for the recruitment fees.": 1,
    "The family doesn't get to see any of it.": 1,
    " It is not only Dubai, it is the dark underbelly of every major city in the world.": 1,
    "It is not only Bangladeshi construction workers, it is workers from all over the world.": 1,
    "It is not only men.": 1,
    " Women are especially vulnerable to recruitment malpractices.": 1,
    " One of the most exciting and newest thing happening in the area of remittances is how to mobilize through innovation diaspora saving and diaspora giving.": 1,
    " Migrants send money home, but they also save a large amount of money where they live.": 1,
    " Annually, migrant savings are estimated to be $500 billion.": 1,
    "$500 billion.": 1,
    "Most of that money is parked in bank deposits that give you 0% interest rate.": 1,
    " if a country were to come and offer 3% or 4% interest rate, and then say that the money would be used for building schools, roads, airports, train systems,": 1,
    " in the country of origin, a lot of migrants would be interested in parting with their money because it's not only financial gains that gives them an opportunity to stay engaged with their country's development.": 1,
    " Remittance channels can be used to sell these bonds to": 1,
    " to migrants because when they come on a monthly basis to send remittances, that's when you can actually sell it to them.": 1,
    " You can also do the same for mobilizing diaspora giving.": 1,
    "I would love to invest in a bullet train system in India, and I would love to contribute to efforts to fight malaria in my village.": 1,
    " Remittances are a great way of sharing prosperity between places.": 1,
    " in a targeted way that benefits those who need them most.": 1,
    " Remittances empower people.": 1,
    " We must do all we can to make remittances and recruitment safer and cheaper.": 1,
    "And it can be done.": 1,
    " As for myself, I have been away from India for two decades now.": 1,
    " My wife is a Venezuelan.": 1,
    "My children are Americans.": 1,
    "Increasingly, I feel like a global citizen.": 1,
    "And yet, I'm growing nostalgic about": 1,
    " my country of birth.": 1,
    "I want to be in India and in the US at the same time.": 1,
    " My parents are not there anymore.": 1,
    "My brothers and sisters have moved on.": 1,
    " There is no real urgency for me to send money home, and yet, from time to time, I send money home to friends, to relatives, to the village.": 1,
    " to be there, to stay engaged, that's part of my identity.": 1,
    "And I'm still striving to be a poet for the hardworking migrants and their struggle to break free of the cycle of poverty.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
