    " I would like to tell you about a project which has started about 16 years ago and it's about making new forms of life.": 1,
    " And these are made of this kind of tube, electricity tube, they call it in Holland.": 1,
    "And we can start a film about that and we can see a little bit backwards in time.": 1,
    " Eventually these beasts are going to live in herds on the beaches.": 1,
    "Teo Jansson is working hard on this evolution.": 1,
    " I want to put this...": 1,
    " forms of life on the beaches and they should survive over there on their own in the future.": 1,
    " learning to live on their own.": 1,
    " and it will take a couple of more years.": 1,
    " to let them walk on their own.": 1,
    " The mechanical beasts will not get their energy from food, but from the wind.": 1,
    "The wind will move feathers on their back, which will drive their feet.": 1,
    " The beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach with its nose pointed into the wind.": 1,
    " As soon as it walks into either the rolling surf or the dry sand, it stops and walks in the opposite direction.": 1,
    " Evolution has generated many species.": 1,
    " I'll be right back.": 1,
    " This is the Animares currants fantosa.": 1,
    " you": 1,
    " This is a herd, and it's built according to a genetic code, and this is a sort of race, and every animal is different, and the winning code...": 1,
    " We'll multiply.": 1,
    "This is the wave going from right to left.": 1,
    "You can see this one.": 1,
    " And now it goes from left to right.": 1,
    "This is a new generation, a new family which is able to store the wind.": 1,
    "So the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles which are on top of the...": 1,
    " And they can use that energy in case the wind falls away and the tide is coming up and they still have a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives.": 1,
    " because they are drowned very easily.": 1,
    " I could show you this animal.": 1,
    " Thank you": 1,
    " So the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking.": 1,
    "There are 11 numbers which are called the 11 holy numbers.": 1,
    "These are the distances.": 1,
    " of the tubes which makes it walk that way.": 1,
    "In fact it's a new invention of the wheel.": 1,
    "It works the same as a wheel.": 1,
    "The axis of a wheel is staying on the same level and this hip is staying on the same level as well.": 1,
    " In fact this is better than a wheel because when you try to drive with your bicycle on the beach you will notice it's going very": 1,
    " very hard to do.": 1,
    "The feet just step over the sand and the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground in between.": 1,
    " So, 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel, we have a new wheel.": 1,
    "I will show you in the next video.": 1,
    "Can you start it, please?": 1,
    " that very heavy loads can be moved.": 1,
    " There's a guy pushing there behind, but he can also walk on the wind pretty well.": 1,
    "It's 3.2 tonnes.": 1,
    " This is a": 1,
    " working on the distort wind in the bottles.": 1,
    "Here's a feeler where it can feel obstacles and turn around and next off you see it's going the other way.": 1,
    " Can I have the feeler here?": 1,
    " Okay, good.": 1,
    " Third, they have to survive all the dangers of the beach.": 1,
    "And one of the big dangers is the sea.": 1,
    "This is the sea.": 1,
    " And it must feel the water of the sea.": 1,
    "And this is the water feeler.": 1,
    "And what's very important is this tube.": 1,
    "It sucks in air normally.": 1,
    " But when it swallows water, it feels the resistance of it.": 1,
    "So imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea.": 1,
    " As soon as it touches the water, you should hear a sort of sound.": 1,
    " of running air.": 1,
    " Yes.": 1,
    " So, if it doesn't feel, it will be drowned, okay?": 1,
    " Here we have the brain of the animal.": 1,
    " In fact, it is a step counter and it counts the steps.": 1,
    "It's a binary step counter.": 1,
    "So as soon as it has been to the C, it...": 1,
    " It changes the pattern of zeros and ones here.": 1,
    " And it knows always where it is on the beach.": 1,
    "So it's a very simple brain.": 1,
    "It says, well, there's the sea, there are the dunes, and I'm here.": 1,
    " So it's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " One of the biggest enemies.": 1,
    " The art of storms.": 1,
    " This is a part of the nose of the animal specifier.": 1,
    " When the nose is fixed of the animal, the whole animal is fixed.": 1,
    " when the storm's coming up.": 1,
    " Drives a pin into the ground.": 1,
    " The nose is fixed, the whole animal is fixed.": 1,
    "The wind may turn, but the animal will turn all its nose into the wind.": 1,
    " Well, not a couple of years and these animals will survive on their own.": 1,
    "I still have to help them a lot.": 1,
    "Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.": 1
