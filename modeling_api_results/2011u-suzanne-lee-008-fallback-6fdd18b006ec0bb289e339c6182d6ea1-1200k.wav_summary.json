    " So as a fashion designer, I've always tended to think of materials something like this.": 1,
    " Or this?": 1,
    " Or maybe this.": 1,
    " But then I met a biologist, and now I think of materials like this.": 1,
    "Green tea, sugar, a few microbes, and a little thyme.": 1,
    " I'm essentially using a kombucha recipe, which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria, yeasts, and other microorganisms which spin cellulose in a fermentation process.": 1,
    " Over time, these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface.": 1,
    " So we start by brewing the tea.": 1,
    "I brew up to about 30 litres of tea at a time, and then while it's still hot, add a couple of kilos of sugar.": 1,
    " We stir this in until it's completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath.": 1,
    "We need to check that the temperature has cooled to below 30 degrees C and then we're ready to add the living organism.": 1,
    "And along with that, some acetic acid.": 1,
    " And once you get this process going, you can actually recycle your previous fermented liquid.": 1,
    " We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth.": 1,
    "And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it.": 1,
    "And actually, in hot weather, I can just grow it outside.": 1,
    "So this is my mini fabric farm.": 1,
    " After about three days, the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid.": 1,
    "So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing.": 1,
    "And the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid.": 1,
    "So they're spinning these tiny nanofibres of pure cellulose.": 1,
    " and they're sticking together forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface.": 1,
    "After about two to three weeks we're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness.": 1,
    " So the bath on the left is after five days and on the right after ten.": 1,
    "And this is a static culture.": 1,
    "You don't have to do anything to it.": 1,
    "You just literally watch it grow.": 1,
    "It doesn't need light.": 1,
    " When it's ready to harvest, you take it out of the bath and you wash it in cold soapy water.": 1,
    " At this point, it's really heavy.": 1,
    "It's over 90% water, so we need to let that evaporate.": 1,
    "So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet.": 1,
    "Again, you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air.": 1,
    " And as it's drying, it's compressing.": 1,
    "So what you're left with, depending on the recipe, is something that's either like a really lightweight transparent paper or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather.": 1,
    " And then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally, or you can use the wet material to form it around a three-dimensional shape.": 1,
    "And as it evaporates, it will knit itself together forming seams.": 1,
    " So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea.": 1,
    "I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin, which intrigues me.": 1,
    " Since it's organic, I'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals.": 1,
    "I can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation.": 1,
    "Using fruit and vegetable staining create organic patterning.": 1,
    " And using indigo, make it antimicrobial.": 1,
    "And in fact, cotton would take up to 18 dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark.": 1,
    " And because of the super absorbency of this kind of cellulose, it just takes one and a really short one at that.": 1,
    " What I can't yet do is make it water resistant.": 1,
    "So if I was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today, I would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water.": 1,
    " The dress would get really heavy, and eventually the seams would probably fall apart, leaving me feeling rather naked.": 1,
    "Possibly a good performance piece, but definitely not ideal for everyday wear.": 1,
    " What I'm looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that I need.": 1,
    "So what I want to do is say to a future bug, spin me a thread.": 1,
    " align it in this direction, make it hydrophobic, and while you're at it, just form it around this 3D shape.": 1,
    " Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing and possibly in the future for biocompatible blood vessels, possibly even replacement bone tissue.": 1,
    " But with synthetic biology, we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality, quantity and shape of material that we desire.": 1,
    " Obviously, as a designer, that's really exciting because then I start to think, wow, you know, we could actually imagine growing consumable products.": 1,
    " What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency.": 1,
    "So we only grow what we need.": 1,
    "There's no waste.": 1,
    " And in fact, we could make it from a waste stream.": 1,
    "So for example, a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant.": 1,
    " Finally, at the end of use, we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings.": 1,
    "What I'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton, leather or other textile materials, but": 1,
    " I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources.": 1,
    "Ultimately, maybe it won't even be fashion where we see these microbes have their impact.": 1,
    "We could, for example, imagine growing a lamp": 1,
    " a chair, a car, or maybe even a house.": 1,
    "So I guess what my question to you is, in the future, what would you choose to grow?": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1,
    " Suzanne, just a curiosity.": 1,
    "What you're wearing is not random.": 1,
    "No.": 1,
    "This is one of the jackets you... Yes, it is.": 1,
    " It's probably part of the project still in process because this one is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes.": 1,
    " It's absorbing my sweat and it's feeding on it.": 1,
    "Okay, so we let you go and save it and rescue it.": 1
