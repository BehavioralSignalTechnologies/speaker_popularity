    " Jihad.": 2,
    "Who killed bin Ladenism?": 2,
    " I'm going to talk about the power of a word.": 1,
    " To the vast majority of practicing Muslims, jihad is an internal struggle for the faith.": 1,
    "It is a struggle within, a struggle against vice and sin, temptation, lust, greed.": 1,
    " It is a struggle to try and live a life that is set by the moral codes written in the Quran.": 1,
    " In that original idea, the concept of jihad is as important to Muslims as the idea of grace is to Christians.": 1,
    " It's a very powerful word, jihad, if you look at it in that respect.": 1,
    "And there's a certain almost mystical resonance to it.": 1,
    " And that's the reason why, for hundreds of years, Muslims everywhere have named their children jihad.": 1,
    "Their daughters, as much as their sons.": 1,
    "In the same way that, say, Christians name their daughters grace.": 1,
    " And Hindus, my people, name our daughters Bhakti, which means, in Sanskrit, spiritual worship.": 1,
    " But they've always been, in Islam, a small group, a minority, who believe that jihad is not only an internal struggle, but also an external struggle against forces that would threaten the faith or the faithful.": 1,
    " And some of these people believe that in that struggle, it is sometimes OK to take up arms.": 1,
    " And so the thousands of young Muslim men who flocked to Afghanistan in the 1980s to fight against the Soviet occupation of a Muslim country, in their minds they were fighting a jihad.": 1,
    "They were doing jihad.": 1,
    " And they named themselves the Mujahideen, which is a word that comes from the same root as Jihad.": 1,
    " And we forget this now, but back then, the Mujahideen were celebrated in this country, in America.": 1,
    "We thought of them as holy warriors who were taking the good fight to the ungodly communists.": 1,
    " America gave them weapons, gave them money, gave them support, encouragement.": 1,
    " But within that group, a tiny smaller group, a minority within a minority within a minority, we're coming up with a new and dangerous conception of jihad.": 1,
    " and in time this group would come to be led by Osama bin Laden.": 1,
    " And he refined the idea.": 1,
    "His idea of jihad was a global war of terror, primarily targeted at the far enemy, at the crusaders from the West against America.": 1,
    " And the things he did in the pursuit of this Jihad were so horrendous, so monstrous and had such great impact that his definition was the one that stuck.": 1,
    " Not just here in the West.": 1,
    "We didn't know any better.": 1,
    "We didn't pause to ask.": 1,
    "We just assumed that if this insane man and his psychopathic followers were calling what they did Jihad, then that's what Jihad must mean.": 1,
    " But it wasn't just us, even in the Muslim world.": 1,
    " his definition of Jihad began to gain acceptance.": 1,
    " A year ago I was in Tunis and I met the Imam of a very small mosque, an old man.": 1,
    "Fifteen years ago he named his granddaughter Jihad.": 1,
    " after the old meaning.": 1,
    "He hoped that a name like that would inspire her to live a spiritual life.": 1,
    " But he told me that after 9-11, he began to have second thoughts.": 1,
    "He worried that if he called her by that name, especially outdoors, outside in public, he might be seen as endorsing Bin Laden's idea of Jihad.": 1,
    " On Fridays in his mosque, he gave sermons trying to reclaim the meaning of the word.": 1,
    " But his congregants, the people who came to his mosque, they had seen the videos.": 1,
    "They had seen pictures of the planes going into the towers, the towers coming down.": 1,
    " they had heard bin Laden say that that was jihad and claimed victory for it.": 1,
    "And so the old imam worried that his words were falling on deaf ears, no one was paying attention.": 1,
    " He was wrong.": 1,
    "Some people were paying attention, but for the wrong reasons.": 1,
    " The United States at this point was putting pressure on all its Arab allies, including Tunisia, to stamp out extremism in their society.": 1,
    " And this imam found himself suddenly in the crosshairs of the Tunisian intelligence service.": 1,
    "They had never paid him any attention before.": 1,
    "Old man, small mosque.": 1,
    " But now they began to pay visits.": 1,
    "And sometimes they would drag him in for questions.": 1,
    "And always the same questions.": 1,
    "Why did you name your daughter, your granddaughter, Jihad?": 1,
    " Why do you keep using the word jihad in your Friday sermons?": 1,
    " Do you hate Americans?": 1,
    "What is your connection to Osama bin Laden?": 1,
    " So to the Tunisian intelligence agencies and organizations like it all over the Arab world, jihad equaled extremism.": 1,
    "Bin Laden's definition had become institutionalized.": 1,
    "That was the power.": 1,
    " of that word that he was able to do.": 1,
    "And it filled this old imam, it filled him with great sadness.": 1,
    " He told me that of Bin Laden's many crimes, this was, in his mind, one that didn't get enough attention, that he took this word, this beautiful idea.": 1,
    " He didn't so much appropriate it as kidnapped it and debased it and corrupted it.": 1,
    " and turned it into something it was never meant to be and then persuaded all of us that it always was.": 1,
    " Global jihad.": 1,
    " But the good news is that the global Jihad is almost over.": 1,
    " has bin Laden defined it.": 1,
    "It was dying well before he did, and now it's on its last legs.": 1,
    "Opinion polls from all over the Muslim world show that there is very little interest among Muslims.": 1,
    " in a global holy war against the West, against the far enemy.": 1,
    " The supply of young men willing to fight and die for this cause is dwindling.": 1,
    "The supply of money, just as important, more important perhaps, the supply of money to this activity is also dwindling.": 1,
    "The wealthy fanatics who were previously": 1,
    " sponsoring this kind of activity are now less generous.": 1,
    " What does that mean for us in the West?": 1,
    "Does it mean we can break out the champagne?": 1,
    " wash our hands off it, disengage, sleep easy at night.": 1,
    " No.": 1,
    "Disengagement is not an option.": 1,
    " Because if you let local...": 1,
    "Survive.": 1,
    "It becomes international jihad.": 1,
    " And so there's now a lot of different violent jihads all over the world.": 1,
    "In Somalia, in Mali, in Nigeria, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Pakistan.": 1,
    "There are groups that claim to be": 1,
    " the inheritors of the legacy of Osama bin Laden.": 1,
    "They use his rhetoric.": 1,
    " They even used the brand name he created for his jihad.": 1,
    "So there is now an al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.": 1,
    "There's an al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.": 1,
    "There is an al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia.": 1,
    " There are other groups in Nigeria, Boko Haram, in Somalia, Al-Shabaab, and they all pay homage to Osama bin Laden.": 1,
    "But if you look closely,": 1,
    " They're not fighting a global jihad.": 1,
    "They're fighting battles over much narrower issues.": 1,
    " Usually it has to do with ethnicity or race or sectarianism or it's a power struggle.": 1,
    "More often than not, it's a power struggle in one country or even a small region within one country.": 1,
    "Occasionally they will go across the border.": 1,
    " from Iraq to Syria, from Mali to Algeria, from Somalia to Kenya, but they are not fighting a global jihad against some far enemy.": 1,
    " But that doesn't mean.": 1,
    " that we can relax.": 1,
    "I was in Yemen recently where it's the home of the last al-Qaeda franchise that still aspires to attack America, to attack the West.": 1,
    "It's old school al-Qaeda.": 1,
    " You may remember that these guys, they're the ones who tried to send the underwear bomber here.": 1,
    "And they were using the internet to try and instigate violence among American Muslims.": 1,
    " But they've been distracted recently.": 1,
    "Last year, they took control over a portion of southern Yemen and ran it Taliban style.": 1,
    " And then the Yemeni military got its act together and ordinary people rose up against these guys and drove them out.": 1,
    "And since then, most of their activities, most of their attacks have been directed at Yemenis.": 1,
    " So I think we've come to a point now where we can say that just like all politics, all jihad is local.": 1,
    "But that's still not reason for us to disengage.": 1,
    " Because we've seen that movie before in Afghanistan, when those Mujahideen defeated the Soviet Union, we disengaged.": 1,
    " And even before the fizz had gone out of our celebratory champagne,": 1,
    " The Taliban had taken over in Kabul.": 1,
    "And we said, local jihad, not our problem.": 1,
    " And then the Taliban gave the keys of Kandahar to Osama bin Laden.": 1,
    "He made it our problem.": 1,
    "Local jihad, if you ignore it, becomes global jihad.": 1,
    " The good news is that it doesn't have to be.": 1,
    "We know how to fight it now.": 1,
    "We have the tools.": 1,
    "We have the know-how.": 1,
    " And we can take the lessons we learned from the fight against global jihad, the victory against global jihad, and apply those to local jihad.": 1,
    "What are those lessons?": 1,
    " We know who killed Bin Laden, SEAL Team 6.": 1,
    " Do we know, do we understand who killed bin Ladenism?": 1,
    "Who ended the global jihad?": 1,
    " There lie the answers to the solution to local jihad.": 1,
    "Let's start with bin Laden himself.": 1,
    " He probably thought 9-11 was his greatest achievement.": 1,
    "In reality, it was the beginning of the end for him.": 1,
    " He killed 3,000 innocent people and that filled the Muslim world with horror and revulsion.": 1,
    " And what that meant was that his idea of jihad could never become mainstream.": 1,
    "He condemned himself to operating on the lunatic fringes of his own community.": 1,
    " 9-11 didn't empower him, it doomed him.": 1,
    " Who killed Bin Ladenism?": 1,
    "Abu Musab Zarqawi killed him.": 1,
    " He was the especially sadistic head of Al-Qaeda in Iraq who sent hundreds of suicide bombers to attack not Americans, but Iraqis, Muslims, Sunni as well as Shiites.": 1,
    " Any claim that Al-Qaeda had to being protectors of Islam against the Western Crusaders was drowned in the blood of Iraqi Muslims.": 1,
    " Who killed Osama bin Laden?": 1,
    "The SEAL Team 6.": 1,
    "Al Jazeera did.": 1,
    "Al Jazeera and half a dozen other satellite news stations in Arabic.": 1,
    " because they circumvented the old state-owned television stations in a lot of these countries.": 1,
    " which were designed to keep information from people.": 1,
    "Al Jazeera brought information to them.": 1,
    " showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion, exposed the hypocrisy of Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda, and allowed them, gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclusions.": 1,
    " who killed bin Ladenism, the Arabs springed it because it showed a way for young Muslims to bring about change.": 1,
    " in a manner that Osama bin Laden with his limited imagination could never have conceived.": 1,
    " who defeated the global jihad, the American military did, the American soldiers did, with their allies, fighting in faraway battle.": 1,
    " fields.": 1,
    " And perhaps the time will come when they get the rightful credit for it.": 1,
    " So all these factors, and many more besides, we don't even fully understand some of them yet, these came together.": 1,
    " To defeat a monstrosity as big as bin Ladenism, the global jihad, you needed this group effort.": 1,
    "Now not all of these things will work in local jihad.": 1,
    "The American military is not going to march into Nigeria to take on Boko Haram.": 1,
    " And it's unlikely that SEAL Team 6 will repel into the homes of Al-Shabaab's leaders and take them out.": 1,
    "But many of these other factors that were in play are now even stronger than before.": 1,
    "Half the work is already done.": 1,
    " We don't have to reinvent the wheel.": 1,
    " The notion of violent jihad in which more Muslims are killed than any other kind of people is already thoroughly discredited.": 1,
    "We don't have to go back to that.": 1,
    " satellite television and the internet are informing and empowering young Muslims in exciting new ways.": 1,
    " And the Arab Spring has produced governments, many of them Islamist governments.": 1,
    " who know that for their own self-preservation they need to take on.": 1,
    " the extremists in their midst.": 1,
    " We don't need to persuade them, but we do need to help them because they haven't really come to this place before.": 1,
    " The good news again is that a lot of the things they need we already have and we are very good at giving.": 1,
    " Economic assistance, not just money, but expertise, technology, know-how.": 1,
    " Private investment, fair terms of trade, medicine, education, technical support for training for their police forces to become more effective, for their anti-terror forces to become more efficient.": 1,
    " We've got plenty of these things.": 1,
    "Some of the other things that they need, we're not very good at giving, maybe nobody is.": 1,
    "Time, patience, subtlety, understanding.": 1,
    " These are harder to give.": 1,
    "I live in New York now.": 1,
    "Just this week, posters have gone up in subway stations in New York that describe jihad as savage.": 1,
    " In all the many years that I've covered the Middle East, I have never been as optimistic as I am today.": 1,
    " that the gap between the Muslim world and the West is narrowing fast.": 1,
    " And one of the many reasons for my optimism is that because I know there are millions, hundreds of millions of people, Muslims like that old Imam in Tunis.": 1,
    " who are reclaiming this word and restoring it.": 1,
    " to its original, beautiful purpose.": 1,
    " Bin Laden is dead.": 1,
    "Bin Ladenism has been defeated.": 1,
    "His definition of jihad can now be expunged.": 1,
    " To that jihad, we can say goodbye, good riddance.": 1,
    " to the real jihad, we can say, welcome back.": 1,
    " Good luck.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
