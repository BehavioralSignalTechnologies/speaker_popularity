    " One of my favourite cartoon characters is Snoopy.": 1,
    "I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life.": 1,
    " So when I thought about compassion my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips where he's lying there and he says": 1,
    " I really understand and I really appreciate how one should love one's neighbour as one loves oneself.": 1,
    " The only trouble is the people next door, I can't stand them.": 1,
    " This, in a way, is one of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea.": 1,
    "We all, I think, believe in compassion.": 1,
    " If you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions, you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion.": 1,
    "So in Judaism we have from our Torah that you should love": 1,
    " your neighbour as you love yourself.": 1,
    "And within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hillel who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself.": 1,
    " And all the main religions have similar teachings.": 1,
    "And again, within Judaism, we have a teaching about God who is called the Compassionate.": 1,
    " After all, how could the world exist without God being compassionate?": 1,
    "And we as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God, so we too have to be compassionate.": 1,
    " But what does it mean?": 1,
    "How does it impact on our everyday life?": 1,
    "Sometimes, of course, being compassionate can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control.": 1,
    " I know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral or when I have been sitting with the bereaved or with people who are dying.": 1,
    " And I am overwhelmed by the sadness, by the": 1,
    " difficulty, the challenge that is there for the family, for the person.": 1,
    "And I'm touched so that tears come to my eyes.": 1,
    " And yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings, I wouldn't be doing my job.": 1,
    " because I have to actually be there for them and make sure that things, that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to.": 1,
    " And yet on the other hand, if I didn't feel this compassion...": 1,
    " then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe and give up being a rabbi.": 1,
    "And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world.": 1,
    " Who can not be touched by compassion when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war or famine or earthquakes or tsunamis?": 1,
    " I know some people who say, well, you know, there's just so much out there.": 1,
    "I can't do anything.": 1,
    "I'm not going to even begin to try.": 1,
    " And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue.": 1,
    "There are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore.": 1,
    " And so they turn off the television and don't watch.": 1,
    " In Judaism, though, we tend to always say there has to be a middle way.": 1,
    " You have to of course be aware of the needs of others, but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people.": 1,
    " So part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick.": 1,
    " And of course you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more.": 1,
    "And there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation, which says that when God created the world,": 1,
    " God thought that it would be best to create the world only with the divine attribute of justice.": 1,
    " Because after all, God is just, therefore there should be justice throughout the world.": 1,
    " And then God looked to the future and realized if the world was created just with justice, the world couldn't exist.": 1,
    "So God thought, no, I'm going to create the world just with compassion.": 1,
    " and then God looked to the future and realized that in fact, if the world is just filled with compassion, then there would be anarchy and chaos.": 1,
    " There have to be limits to all things.": 1,
    "The rabbis describe this as being like a king who has a beautiful, fragile glass bow.": 1,
    " If you put too much cold water in it will crack, it will shatter.": 1,
    "If you put boiling water in it will shatter.": 1,
    "What do you have to do?": 1,
    "Put in a mixture of the two.": 1,
    " And so God put both these possibilities into the world.": 1,
    " There is something more though that has to be there.": 1,
    " And that is the translation of the feelings that we may have about compassion into the wider world, into action.": 1,
    " You know, like Snoopy, we can't just lie there and think great thoughts about our neighbours.": 1,
    "We actually have to do something about it.": 1,
    " And so there is also within Judaism this notion of loving kindness that becomes very important.": 1,
    "Chesed.": 1,
    " All these three things then have to be melded together.": 1,
    "The idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our lives.": 1,
    " and gives us a feeling of what's right about life, what's right about living, what should we be doing, social justice.": 1,
    "There has to be a willingness to do good deeds.": 1,
    " but not of course at the expense of our own sanity.": 1,
    " There's no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things.": 1,
    "And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion, which has to be there, if you like, at our very roots.": 1,
    " This idea of compassion comes to us because we're made in the image of God, who is ultimately the compassionate one.": 1,
    " What does this compassion entail?": 1,
    "It entails understanding the pain of the other.": 1,
    " But even more than that, it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation.": 1,
    " that understanding that one is part of that creation, that there is a unity that underlies all that we see, all that we hear, all that we feel.": 1,
    " I call that unity God.": 1,
    " and that that unity is something that connects all of creation.": 1,
    "And of course in the modern world with the environmental movement we're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things.": 1,
    " that something I do here actually does matter.": 1,
    " that if I use too much of my carbon allowance, it seems to be that we are causing a great lack of rain in Central or Eastern Africa.": 1,
    " So there is a connectivity and I have to understand that as part of the creation, as part of me being made in the image of God.": 1,
    " And I have to understand that my needs sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs.": 1,
    "This 18 minutes business": 1,
    " I find quite fascinating because in Judaism the word, the number 18 in Hebrew letters stands for life, the word life.": 1,
    " So in a sense the 18 minutes are challenging me to say in life this is what's important in terms of compassion.": 1,
    "But there's something else as well.": 1,
    " Actually 18 minutes is important because at Passover when we have to eat unleavened bread": 1,
    " rabbis say what is the difference between dough that's made into bread and dough that's made into unleavened bread, matzah, and they say it's 18 minutes.": 1,
    " Because that's how long it takes for this dough to become leaven.": 1,
    "What does it mean dough becomes leaven?": 1,
    "It means it gets filled with hot air.": 1,
    "What's matzo?": 1,
    "What's unleavened bread?": 1,
    "You don't get it.": 1,
    " Symbolically, what the rabbis say is that at Passover what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air.": 1,
    " our pride, our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world and that everything should revolve around us.": 1,
    " So we try and get rid of those and so do we try to get rid of the habits, the emotions, the ideas that enslave us, that make our eyes": 1,
    " Close.": 1,
    "Give us tunnel vision so we don't see the needs of others.": 1,
    " and free ourselves from that.": 1,
    " And that too is a basis for having compassion, for understanding our place in the world.": 1,
    " Now there is.": 1,
    " Judaism, a gorgeous story.": 1,
    " of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day.": 1,
    " And as many people do, he was dozing off during the sermon.": 1,
    " And as he was dozing off they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah and they were saying that": 1,
    " In the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem, the priests used to have bread which they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem.": 1,
    " The man was asleep, but he heard the words, bread, temple, God.": 1,
    "And he woke up.": 1,
    "He said, God wants bread.": 1,
    "That's it.": 1,
    "God wants bread.": 1,
    "I know what God wants.": 1,
    "And he rushed home.": 1,
    " And after the Sabbath he made 12 loaves of bread, took them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue, opened the ark and said, God, I don't know why you want this bread, but here you are.": 1,
    " and he put it in the Ark with the scrolls of the Torah.": 1,
    " Then he went home.": 1,
    " The cleaner came into the synagogue.": 1,
    "Oh God, I'm in such trouble.": 1,
    "I've got children to feed and my wife's ill.": 1,
    "I've got no money.": 1,
    "What can I do?": 1,
    "Goes into the synagogue.": 1,
    "God, will you please help me?": 1,
    " Oh, what a wonderful smell.": 1,
    "Goes to the Ark.": 1,
    "He opens the Ark.": 1,
    "There's bread!": 1,
    "God, you've answered my... Please, you've answered my question!": 1,
    "Takes the bread and goes home.": 1,
    " Meanwhile, the rich man fixed himself.": 1,
    " I'm an idiot.": 1,
    "God wants bread?": 1,
    "God, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?": 1,
    "He rushes to the synagogue.": 1,
    "I get it out of the ark before anybody finds it.": 1,
    "Goes in there, and it's not there.": 1,
    " And he says, God, you really did want it.": 1,
    "You wanted my bread.": 1,
    "Next week with raisins.": 1,
    "This went on for years.": 1,
    "Every week the man would bring bread with raisins with raisins.": 1,
    " What sorts of good things?": 1,
    "Put it into the ark.": 1,
    "Every week the cleaner would come.": 1,
    "God, you've answered my plea again.": 1,
    "Take the bread.": 1,
    "Take it home.": 1,
    "Went on until a new rabbi came.": 1,
    "Rabbis always spoil things.": 1,
    "The rabbi came in.": 1,
    " and saw what was going on and he called the two of them to his office and he said you know this is what's happening and the rich man": 1,
    " Dear Crestfallen, you mean God didn't want my bread?": 1,
    " And the poor man said...": 1,
    " And you mean God didn't answer my pleas?": 1,
    " And the rabbi said, you've misunderstood me.": 1,
    " misunderstood totally he said of course what you are doing he said to the rich man is answering God's plea that we should be compassionate": 1,
    " And God, he said to the poor man, is answering your plea that people should be compassionate and give.": 1,
    " He looked at the rich man.": 1,
    "He held the rich man's hands and said, don't you understand, he said, these are the hands of God.": 1,
    " So that is the way I feel that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate.": 1,
    " of understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world.": 1,
    " that I want to try and serve that unity.": 1,
    " and that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope, trying to understand something of the pain of others.": 1,
    " but understanding that there are limits that people have to bear responsibility for some of the problems that come upon them.": 1,
    " and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy.": 1,
    " to the giving I can give.": 1,
    " I have to re-evaluate them, try and separate out the material things and my emotions that may be enslaving me so that I can see the world clearly.": 1,
    " And then I have to try to see in what ways I can make these the hands of God.": 1,
    " and so try to bring compassion to life in this world.": 1
