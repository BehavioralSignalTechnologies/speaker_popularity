    "The communist Khmer Rouge enters Phnom Penh to liberate their people from the encroaching conflict in Vietnam and American bombing campaigns.": 1,

    " for three days, and here's a picture of the Khmer Rouge.": 1,
    "They were actually young soldiers, typically child soldiers, and this is very normal now of modern-day conflict because they're easy to bring into wars.": 1,

    "It's actually a very pretty area of Cambodia where rice growing takes place.": 1,
    " And in fact, they were forced to work the fields.": 1,

    " And it was at that time that my mother got word from the commune chief that the Vietnamese were actually asking for their citizens to go back to Vietnam.": 1,
    " And she spoke some Vietnamese as a child, having grown up with Vietnamese friends, and she decided, despite the advice of her neighbors, that she would take the chance and claim to be Vietnamese so that": 1,
    " We could have a chance to survive because at this point they're forcing everybody to work and they're giving about In a modern-day caloric restriction diet, I guess they're giving it porridge with a few grains of rice": 1,
