    " As technology progresses and as it advances, many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent, make us smarter and more connected to the world.": 1,
    "And what I'd like to argue is that that's not necessarily the case.": 1,
    " as progress is simply a word for change.": 1,
    "And with change you gain something, but you also lose something.": 1,
    "And to really illustrate this point, what I'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with a very simple, a very": 1,
    " common, an everyday question, and that question is this.": 1,
    " What time is it?": 1,
    "What time is it?": 1,
    "If you glance at your iPhone, it's so simple to tell the time.": 1,
    "But I'd like to ask you, how would you tell the time if you didn't have an iPhone?": 1,
    "How would you tell the time, say, 600 years ago?": 1,
    "How would you do it?": 1,
    " Well, the way you would do it is by using a device that's called an astrolabe.": 1,
    " So an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world, but at the time, in the 13th century, it was the gadget of the day.": 1,
    "It was the world's first popular computer, and it was a device that, in fact, is a model of the sky.": 1,
    " So the different parts of the astrolabe in this particular type, the reet corresponds to the position of the stars, the plate corresponds to a coordinate system, and the mater has some scales and puts it all together.": 1,
    " If you were an educated child, you would know how to not only use the astrolabe, you would also know how to make an astrolabe.": 1,
    "And we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe, the first technical manual in the English language,": 1,
    " was written by Geoffrey Chaucer.": 1,
    "Yes, that Geoffrey Chaucer in 1391 to his little Lewis, his 11-year-old son.": 1,
    " And in this book, Little Lewis would know the big idea.": 1,
    "And the central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic projection.": 1,
    " Basically, the concept is how do you represent the three-dimensional image of the night sky that surrounds us onto a flat, portable, two-dimensional surface?": 1,
    " The idea is actually relatively simple.": 1,
    "Imagine that the Earth is at the center of the universe and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere.": 1,
    "Each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole onto a flat surface where it's then recorded.": 1,
    " So the north star corresponds to the center of the device.": 1,
    "The ecliptic, which is the path of the sun, moon and planets, corresponds to an offset circle.": 1,
    " The bright stars correspond to little daggers on the reet, and the altitude corresponds to the plate system.": 1,
    "Now, the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection.": 1,
    " The real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly.": 1,
    "There's the position of the sun, moon, and planets on the movable reet, and then there's their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate.": 1,
    " OK, so how would you use this device?": 1,
    " Well, let me first back up for a moment.": 1,
    " This is an astrolabe.": 1,
    " Pretty impressive, isn't it?": 1,
    "And so this astrolabe is on loan from us from the Oxford School of Museum of History.": 1,
    "And you can see the different components.": 1,
    "This is the mater, the scales on the back.": 1,
    " This is the reet.": 1,
    "Do you see that?": 1,
    "That's the movable part of the sky.": 1,
    "And in the back you can see a spider web pattern.": 1,
    "And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky.": 1,
    " This is a rural device, and on the back are some other devices, measuring tools, and scales to be able to make some calculations.": 1,
    " You know, I've always wanted one of these.": 1,
    "For my thesis, I actually built one of these out of paper.": 1,
    "And this one, this is a replica from a 15th century device, and it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros.": 1,
    " But a real one would cost about as much as my house, and the house next to it, and actually every house on the block, on both sides of the street, maybe a school thrown in, and a church, they're just incredibly expensive.": 1,
    "But let me show you how to work this device.": 1,
    " So let's go to step one.": 1,
    "First thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky if you're telling time at night.": 1,
    "So tonight, if it's clear, you'll be able to see the summer triangle, and there's a bright star called Deneb.": 1,
    "So let's select Deneb.": 1,
    " Second is you measure the altitude of Danips.": 1,
    "So step two, I hold the device up and then I sight.": 1,
    " its altitude there so I can see it clearly now.": 1,
    "And then I measure its altitude.": 1,
    "So it's about 26 degrees.": 1,
    "You can't see it from over there.": 1,
    " Step three is identify the star on the front of the device.": 1,
    "Deneb is there, I can tell.": 1,
    "Step four is I then move the reed, move the sky,": 1,
    " So the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back.": 1,
    "So when that happens, everything lines up.": 1,
    "I have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky.": 1,
    " Okay, so it is, in a sense, holding a model of the universe in my hands.": 1,
    "And then finally, I take a rule.": 1,
    " and move the rule to a date line, which then tells me the time here.": 1,
    "So that's how the device is used.": 1,
    " So I know what you're thinking, that's a lot of work, isn't it?": 1,
    "Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time.": 1,
    "But there's a difference between the two because with your iPod you can tell": 1,
    " or your iPhone, you can tell exactly what the time is with precision.": 1,
    "The way little Louis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky.": 1,
    "He would know where things would fit in the sky.": 1,
    "He would not only know": 1,
    " what time it was, he would also know where the sun would rise and how it would move across the sky.": 1,
    "He would know what time the sun would rise and what time it would set.": 1,
    "And he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens.": 1,
    " So in computer graphics and computer user interface design, there is a term called affordances.": 1,
    " So affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it.": 1,
    "And what the astrolabe does is it allows us, it affords us to connect to the night sky, to look up to the night sky and be much more": 1,
    " to see the visible and the invisible together.": 1,
    "So that's just one use.": 1,
    "It's incredible.": 1,
    " There's probably 350, 400 uses.": 1,
    "In fact, there's a text that has over 1,000 uses of this first computer.": 1,
    "On the back, there's scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation.": 1,
    " survey with it, the city of Baghdad was surveyed with it, it could be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types, and it would take a full university course to illustrate it.": 1,
    " Astrolabes have an incredible history.": 1,
    "They're over 2,000 years old.": 1,
    "The concept of stereographic projection originated in 330 BC.": 1,
    " And the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms.": 1,
    "There's portable ones, there's large display ones.": 1,
    "And I think what's common to all astrolabes is that they're beautiful works of art.": 1,
    "There's a quality of craftsmanship and precision.": 1,
    " that is just astonishing and remarkable.": 1,
    "Astrolabes, like every technology, do evolve over time.": 1,
    "So the earliest reets, for example, were very simple and primitive.": 1,
    " and advancing reeds became cultural emblems.": 1,
    "This is one from Oxford and I find this one really extraordinary because the reed pattern is completely symmetrical.": 1,
    " and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical or random sky.": 1,
    "How cool is that?": 1,
    "It's just amazing.": 1,
    "So would little Lewis have an astrolabe?": 1,
    " probably not one made of brass, he would have one made of wood or paper.": 1,
    "And the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket.": 1,
    " So what does the astrolabe inspire?": 1,
    "Well, I think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were, our forebears were, years and years ago.": 1,
    "It's just an incredible device.": 1,
    " Every technology advances.": 1,
    "Every technology is transformed and moved by others.": 1,
    "And what we gain with the new technologies, of course, is precision and accuracy.": 1,
    " But what we lose, I think, is an accurate, a felt sense of the sky, a sense of context.": 1,
    " Knowing the sky, knowing your relationship with the sky is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is.": 1,
    " So I think the astrolabes are just remarkable devices.": 1,
    "And so what can we learn from these devices?": 1,
    "Well, primarily that there's a subtle knowledge that we can connect with the world and": 1,
    " astrolabes return us to this subtle sense of how things all fit together and also how we connect to the world.": 1,
    "Thanks very much.": 1
