    "Someone took credit for Twitter bombing my account.": 1,

    "She was about the same age as my mother, she had this wild curly hair, and she always wore these bright yellow flowery dresses.": 1,
    " She was one of those doctors who, if you fell and you broke your arm, she'd ask you why you weren't laughing, because it's your humorous, get it?": 1,
    " See, you've grown, but she'd always make you feel better after having seen her.": 1,
    "Well, we all have that childhood hero that we want to grow up to be just like, right?": 1,
    "Well, I want it to be just like Dr. Sam.": 1,
    " When I was eight, my parents and I moved to the US, and ours became the typical immigrant narrative.": 1,
    "My parents cleaned hotel rooms and washed dishes and pumped gas so that I could pursue my dream.": 1,
    " Well, eventually, I learned enough English and my parents were so happy the day that I got into medical school and took my oath of healing and service.": 1,
    " But then one day, everything changed.": 1,
    "My mother called me to tell me that she wasn't feeling well, that she had this cough that wouldn't go away, that she was short of breath and tired.": 1,
    "Well, I knew that my mother was someone who never complained about anything.": 1,
    " For her to tell me that something was the matter, I knew something had to be really wrong.": 1,
    "And it was.": 1,

    " She tried to look up her oncologist's phone number on the internet, and she found it.": 1,
    "But she found something else, too.": 1,
    "On several websites, he was listed as a highly paid speaker to a drug company, and in fact, often spoke on behalf of the same chemo regimen": 1,
    " that he had prescribed her.": 1,
    "She called me in a panic, and I didn't know what to believe.": 1,
    "Maybe this was the right chemo regimen for her, but maybe it wasn't.": 1,
    "It made her scared, and it made her doubt.": 1,

    "Now imagine being his parents who flew in from Seattle 2,000 miles away to find their son in a coma.": 1,
    "I mean, you'd want to find out what's going on with him, right?": 1,
    " They asked to attend our bedside rounds where we discussed his condition and his plan, which I thought was a pretty reasonable request and also would give us a chance to show them how much we were trying and how much we cared.": 1,
    " The head doctor though said no.": 1,
    "He gave all kinds of reasons.": 1,
    "Maybe they'll get in the nurse's way.": 1,
    "Maybe they'll stop students from asking questions.": 1,
    " He even said, what if they see mistakes and sue us?": 1,
    " What I saw behind every excuse was deep fear.": 1,
    "And what I learned was that to become a doctor, we have to put on our white coats, put up a wall, and hide behind it.": 1,

    " And so what do we do?": 1,
    "We put on our white coats and we hide behind them.": 1,

    "The more fear then spirals into mistrust and poor medical care.": 1,
    "We don't just have a fear of sickness.": 1,
    " we have a sickness of fear.": 1,
    " Can we bridge this disconnect between what patients need and what doctors do?": 1,

    " One after another, our respondents told us that that doctor-patient relationship is a deeply intimate one.": 1,
    "That to show their doctors their bodies and tell them their deepest secrets,": 1,
