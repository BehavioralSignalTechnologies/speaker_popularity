    " I'm talking to you about the worst form of human rights violation, the third largest organized crime, a 10 billion dollar industry.": 1,
    "I'm talking to you.": 1,
    " about a modern day slavery.": 1,
    " I'd like to tell you the story of these three children, Pranita, Shaheen and Anjali.": 1,
    "Pranita's mother was a woman in prostitution.": 1,
    " a prostituted person.": 1,
    "She got infected with HIV.": 1,
    " And towards the end of her life, when she was in the final stages of AIDS, she could not prostitute.": 1,
    " So she sold four year old Pranita to a broker.": 1,
    " By the time we got the information, we reached there, Pranita was already raped by three men.": 1,
    " Shaheen's background I don't even know.": 1,
    " We found her in a railway track.": 1,
    " raped by many, many men, I don't know how many, but the indications of that on her body was that her intestine was outside her body.": 1,
    " And when we took her to the hospital, she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body.": 1,
    "We still don't know who her parents are, who she is, all that we know that hundreds of men had used her brutally.": 1,
    " Anjali's father, a drunkard sold his child for pornography.": 1,
    " You're seeing here images of three years, four year olds, and five year old children.": 1,
    " who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation.": 1,
    " in this country and across the globe.": 1,
    "Hundreds and thousands of children, as young as three, as young as four, are sold into sexual slavery.": 1,
    " But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for.": 1,
    "They're sold in the name of adoption.": 1,
    "They're sold in the name of organ trade.": 1,
    "They're sold in the name of forced labor, camel jockeying, anything, everything.": 1,
    " I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation and I tell you stories from there.": 1,
    "My own journey to work with these children started as a teenager.": 1,
    "I was 15 when I was gang raped by eight men.": 1,
    " I don't remember the rape part of it so much as much as the anger part of it.": 1,
    " Yes, there were each one who defiled me, raped me, but that didn't go into my conscience.": 1,
    "I never felt like a victim then or now.": 1,
    "But what lingered from then to now, I am 40 today.": 1,
    " is this huge outrageous anger.": 1,
    "Two years I was ostracized, I was stigmatized, I was isolated because I was a victim.": 1,
    " And that's what we do to all traffic survivors.": 1,
    "We as civil society, we have PhDs in victimizing a victim.": 1,
    " Right from the age of 15, when I started looking around me, I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children who are left in sexual slavery-like practices.": 1,
    " but have absolutely no respite because we don't allow them to come in.": 1,
    "Where does their journey begin?": 1,
    "Most of them come from very optionless families, not just poor.": 1,
    " You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked.": 1,
    "I had this IS officer's daughter, who's 14 years old, studying in 9th standard, who was web chatting with one individual.": 1,
    " and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine who was trafficked.": 1,
    "I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very, very well-to-do families and children from well-to-do families who are getting trafficked.": 1,
    " These people are deceived, forced,": 1,
    " 99.9% of them resist being inducted into prostitution.": 1,
    " Some pay the price for it.": 1,
    " They're killed.": 1,
    "We don't even hear about them.": 1,
    " They are voiceless, anamikas, nameless people.": 1,
    " But the rest who succumb into it go through everyday torture.": 1,
    "Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends or who want to have a family with you.": 1,
    " These are men who buy you for an hour, for a day, use you, throw you.": 1,
    " Each of the girls that I have rescued, I have rescued more than 3,200 girls.": 1,
    "Each of them tell me one story in common.": 1,
    " One story about one man at least putting chilli powder in her vagina.": 1,
    " One man taking a cigarette and burning her.": 1,
    "One man whipping her.": 1,
    "We are living among those men.": 1,
    "They are our brothers, fathers, uncles, cousins, all around us.": 1,
    "And we are silent about them.": 1,
    " We think it is easy money.": 1,
    "We think it is shortcut.": 1,
    "We think the person likes to do what she is doing.": 1,
    " But the extra bonuses that she gets is the various infections, sexually transmitted infections, HIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it, substance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun.": 1,
    " And one day, she gives up on you and me because we have no options for her.": 1,
    "And therefore, she starts normalizing this exploitation.": 1,
    "She believes, yes, this is it.": 1,
    "This is what my destiny is about.": 1,
    " And this is normal to get raped by 100 men a day.": 1,
    "And it's abnormal to live in a shelter.": 1,
    "It's abnormal to get rehabilitated.": 1,
    "It's in that context that I work.": 1,
    "It's in that context that I rescue children.": 1,
    " I've rescued children as young as three years, and I've rescued women as old as 40 years.": 1,
    " When I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had was, where do I begin?": 1,
    " Because...": 1,
    " I had lots of them who were already HIV infected.": 1,
    "One third of the people I rescue are HIV positive.": 1,
    " And therefore, my challenge was to understand how can I get out the power from this pain.": 1,
    " And for me, I was my greatest experience.": 1,
    "Understanding my own self, understanding my own pain, my own isolation was my greatest teacher.": 1,
    " Because what we did with these girls is to understand their potential.": 1,
    "You see a girl here who is trained as a welder.": 1,
    " She works for a very big company, a workshop in Hyderabad, making furnitures.": 1,
    "She earns around 12,000 rupees.": 1,
    "She's an illiterate girl.": 1,
    " trained, skilled as a welder.": 1,
    "Why welding and why not computers?": 1,
    " We felt one of the things that these girls had": 1,
    " is immense amount of courage.": 1,
    "They did not have any pardas inside their body, hijabs inside themselves.": 1,
    "They've crossed the barrier of it.": 1,
    " and therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world very easily and not feel very shy about it.": 1,
    " We have trained girls as carpenters, as masons, as security guards, as cab drivers, and each one of them are excelling in their chosen field.": 1,
    " gaining confidence, restoring dignity, and building hopes in their own lives.": 1,
    "These girls are also working in big construction companies like Ramkey Construction as full-time masons.": 1,
    " What has been my challenge?": 1,
    " My challenge?": 1,
    " has not been the traffickers who beat me up.": 1,
    "I've been beaten up more than 14 times in my life.": 1,
    " I can't hear from my right ear.": 1,
    " I've lost a staff of mine who was murdered while on a rescue.": 1,
    " My biggest challenge is a civil society.": 1,

    " My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims as our own.": 1,

    "When her mother fell sick,": 1,
    " She said, Sunita, you have so much of contacts.": 1,
    "Can you get somebody in my house to work so that she can look after my mother?": 1,
    "And there's a long pause, and then she says, not one of our girls.": 1,
    " It's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking in this fantastic AC hall.": 1,
    "It's very nice for discussion, discourse, making films and everything, but it is not nice.": 1,
    " to bring them to our homes.": 1,
    "It's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies.": 1,
    "It's not nice for our children to study with their children.": 1,
    " There it ends.": 1,
    "That's my biggest challenge.": 1,
    "If I'm here today, I'm here not only as Sunita Krishnan, I'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking.": 1,
    " They need your compassion.": 1,
    "They need your empathy.": 1,
    "They need much more than anything else, your acceptance.": 1,
    " Many times when I talk to people, I keep telling them one thing.": 1,
    "Don't tell me hundred ways how you cannot respond to this problem.": 1,
    " Can you apply your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem?": 1,
    "And that's what I'm here for, asking for your support, demanding for your support, requesting for your support.": 1,
