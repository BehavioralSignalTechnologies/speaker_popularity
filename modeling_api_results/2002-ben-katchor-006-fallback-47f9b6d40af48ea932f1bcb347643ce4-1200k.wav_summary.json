    "That's the end.": 3,
    " I'm going to read a few strips.": 1,
    "Most of these are from a monthly page I do in an architecture and design magazine called Metropolis.": 1,
    " And the first story is called The Faulty Switch, another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch.": 1,
    " It's fine during the day when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight, but at dusk everything changes.": 1,
    " The architect spent hundreds of hours designing a burnished brass switch plates for his new office tower.": 1,
    " and then left it to a contractor to install these 79 cent switches behind them.": 1,
    " We know instinctively where to reach when we enter a dark room.": 1,
    "We automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward.": 1,
    " But the sound we are greeted with as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late afternoon light.": 1,
    " recalls to mind a dirty men's room in the rear of a Greek coffee shop.": 1,
    " This sound colors our first impression of any room.": 1,
    "It can't be helped.": 1,
    "But where does this sound, commonly described as a click, come from?": 1,
    " Is it simply the byproduct of a crude mechanical action?": 1,
    " Or is it an imitation of one half the set of sounds we make to express disappointment, the orphaned dental consonant of no Indo-European language?": 1,
    " or is it the amplified sound of a synapse firing in the brain of a cockroach?": 1,
    " In the 1950s, they tried their best to muffle this sound with mercury switches and silent knob controls.": 1,
    " But today these improvements seem somehow inauthentic.": 1,
    "The clique is the modern, triumphal clarion proceeding us through life.": 1,
    " announcing our entry into every lightless room.": 1,
    "The sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature.": 1,
    "It has a deep melancholy ring.": 1,
    " Children don't like it.": 1,
    "It's why they leave lights on around the house.": 1,
    "Adults find it comforting.": 1,
    " But wouldn't it be an easy matter to wire a wall switch so that it triggers the muted horn of a steamship or the recorded crowing of a rooster?": 1,
    " or the distant peal of thunder.": 1,
    " Thomas Edison went through thousands of unlikely substances before he came upon the right one for the filament of his electric light bulb.": 1,
    " Why have we settled so quickly for the sound of its switch?": 1,
    "That's the end of that.": 1,
    " And the next story is called In Praise of the Taxpayer.": 1,
    " That so many of the city's most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom is cause for celebration.": 1,
    " These one or two story structures designed to yield only enough income to cover the taxes on the land on which they stand were not meant to be permanent buildings.": 1,
    " Yet for one reason or another, they have confounded the efforts of developers to be combined into lots suitable for high-rise construction.": 1,
    " Although they make no claim to architectural beauty, they are in their perfect temporariness.": 1,
    " a delightful alternative to the large-scale structures that might someday take their place.": 1,
    " The most perfect examples occupy corner lots.": 1,
    "They offer a pleasant respite from the high density development around them, a break of light and air.": 1,
    " an architectural biding of time.": 1,
    "So buried in signage of these structures that it often takes a moment to distinguish the modern, specially constructed taxpayer": 1,
    " from its neighbor.": 1,
    " the small commercial building from an earlier century whose upper floors have been sealed and whose ground floor space now functions as a taxpayer.": 1,
    " The few surfaces not covered by signs are often clad in a distinctive dark green-gray striated aluminum siding.": 1,
    " take out sandwich shops, film processing drop-offs, peep shows, and necktie stores.": 1,
    " These provisional structures have in some cases remained standing for the better part of a human lifetime.": 1,
    " The temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization, a healthy sublimation of the urge to build.": 1,
    " and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone.": 1,
    " And the next story is called On the Human Lamp.": 1,
    " For the ancient Egyptians, the lap was a platform upon which to place the earthly possessions of the dead, thirty cubits from foot to knee.": 1,
    " It was not until the 14th century that an Italian painter recognized the lap as a Grecian temple upholstered in flesh and cloth.": 1,
    " Over the next 200 years, we see the infant Christ go from a sitting to a standing position on the Virgin's lap and then back again.": 1,
    " Every child recapitulates this ascension, straddling one or both legs, sitting sideways or leaning against the body.": 1,
    " From there to the modern ventriloquist's dummy is but a brief moment in history.": 1,
    " You were late for school again this morning.": 1,
    "The ventriloquist must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap.": 1,
    "The illusion of speech follows incidentally.": 1,
    " What have you got to say for yourself, Jimmy?": 1,
    "As adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance.": 1,
    " We have fading memories of that provisional temple erected each time an adult sat down.": 1,
    "On a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on.": 1,
    " It is children and teenage girls who are most keenly aware of its architectural beauty.": 1,
    " They understand the structural integrity of a deep, avuncular lap as compared to the shaky arrangement of a neurotic niece in high heels.": 1,
    " The relationship between the lap and its owner is direct and intimate.": 1,
    " I envision a 36-story, 450-unit residential high-rise.": 1,
    "A reason to consider the mental health of any architect before granting an important commission.": 1,
    " The bathrooms and kitchens will of course have no windows.": 1,
    " The lap of luxury is an architectural construct of childhood which we seek in vain as adults to employ.": 1,
    " The next story is called The Havrepiece Collection.": 1,
    "A nondescript warehouse, visible for a moment.": 1,
    " from the northbound lanes of the Prakuszko Expressway serves as the temporary resting place for the haverpiece collection of European dried fruit.": 1,
    " the profound convolutions on the surface of a dried cherry, the foreboding sheen of an extra large date.": 1,
    " Do you remember wandering as a child through those dark wooden storefront galleries where everything was displayed in poorly labeled roach-proof bins?": 1,
    " Pairs dried in the form of genital organs, apricot halves like the ears of cherubim.": 1,
    " In 1962, the unsold stock was purchased by Maurice Haverpiece, a wealthy prune juice bottler, and consolidated to form the Core Collection.": 1,
    " As an art form, it lies somewhere between still life painting and plumbing.": 1,
    " Upon his death in 1967, a quarter of the items were sold off for compote to a high-class hotel restaurant.": 1,
    " Unsuspecting guests were served stewed turn-of-the-century Turkish figs for breakfast.": 1,
    " The rest of the collection remains here, stored in plain brown paper bags until funds can be raised to build a permanent museum and study center.": 1,
    " A shoe made of apricot leather for the daughter of a czar.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
