    " So I'm a huge believer in hands-on education.": 1,
    " But you have to have the right tools.": 1,
    "If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics, I'm not going to give her a soldering iron.": 1,
    "And similarly, she finds prototyping boards really frustrating for her little hands.": 1,
    " So my wonderful student Sam and I decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of, Play-Doh.": 1,
    "And so we spent a summer.": 1,
    " looking at different Play-Doh recipes.": 1,
    "And these recipes probably look really familiar to any of you who have made homemade Play-Doh.": 1,
    "Pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen.": 1,
    "We have two favorite recipes, one that had these ingredients.": 1,
    " and a second that had sugar instead of salt.": 1,
    "And they're great.": 1,
    "We can make great little sculptures with these.": 1,
    "But the really cool thing about them is when we put them together.": 1,
    " You see that really salty Play-Doh?": 1,
    "Well, it conducts electricity.": 1,
    "And this is nothing new.": 1,
    "It turns out the regular Play-Doh that you buy at the stores conducts electricity, and high school physics teachers have used that for years.": 1,
    "But our homemade Play-Doh actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh.": 1,
    " And that sugar dough, well, it's 150 times more resistant to electric current than that salt dough.": 1,
    "So what does that mean?": 1,
    "Well, it means if you put them together,": 1,
    " you suddenly have circuits.": 1,
    "Circuits that the most creative, tiny little hands can build on their own.": 1,
    " So I want to do a little demo for you.": 1,
    " So if I take this salt dough, again, it's like the play dough you probably made as kids, and I plug it in to two leads of a battery pack, simple battery pack.": 1,
    "You can buy them at Radio Shack and pretty much anywhere else.": 1,
    " We can actually then...": 1,
    " light things up.": 1,
    " But if any of you have studied electrical engineering, we can also create a short circuit.": 1,
    "If I push these together, the light turns off, right?": 1,
    "The current wants to run through the Play-Doh, not through that LED.": 1,
    "If I separate them again, I have some light.": 1,
    " Well, now if I take that sugar dough, the sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity.": 1,
    "It's like a wall of electricity.": 1,
    "If I place that between, now all the dough is touching, but if I stick that light back in,": 1,
    " I have light.": 1,
    "In fact, I could even add some movement to my sculptures.": 1,
    "If I want a spinning tail, let's grab a motor, put some Play-Doh on it, stick it on, and we have spinning.": 1,
    " And once you have the basics, we can make a slightly more complicated circuit.": 1,
    "We call this our sushi circuit.": 1,
    "It's very popular with kids.": 1,
    "I plug in again the power to it.": 1,
    " And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits.": 1,
    "I can start plugging in lots of lights.": 1,
    " And we can start talking about things like electrical load.": 1,
    "What happens if I put in lots of lights and then add a motor?": 1,
    "It'll dim.": 1,
    " We can even add microprocessors and have this as an input and create squishy sound music that we've done.": 1,
    "You could do parallel and theory circuits for kids using this.": 1,
    " So this is all in your home kitchen.": 1,
    "We've actually tried to turn it into electrical engineering lab.": 1,
    "We have a website.": 1,
    "It's all there.": 1,
    "These are the home recipes.": 1,
    "We've got some videos.": 1,
    "You can make them yourselves.": 1,
    "And it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone.": 1,
    " a mom in Utah who used them with her kids to a science researcher in the UK and curriculum developers in Hawaii.": 1,
    "So I would encourage you all to grab some Play-Doh, grab some salt, grab some sugar and start playing.": 1,
    "We don't usually think of our kitchen.": 1,
    " as an electrical engineering lab or little kids as circuit designers.": 1,
    "But maybe we should.": 1,
    "Have fun.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
