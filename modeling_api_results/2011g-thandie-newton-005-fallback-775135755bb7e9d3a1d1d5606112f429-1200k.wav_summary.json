    " embracing otherness.": 1,
    " When I first heard this theme, I thought, well, embracing otherness is embracing myself.": 1,
    "And the journey to that place of understanding and acceptance has been an interesting one for me.": 1,
    " And it's given me an insight into the whole notion of self, which I think is worth sharing with you today.": 1,
    "We each have a self, but I don't think that we're born with one.": 1,
    " You know how newborn babies believe they're part of everything.": 1,
    "They're not separate.": 1,
    "Well, that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly.": 1,
    "It's like that initial stage is over.": 1,
    "Oneness, infancy.": 1,
    " Unformed, primitive, it's no longer valid or real.": 1,
    "What is real is separateness.": 1,
    "And at some point in early babyhood, the idea of self starts to form.": 1,
    " Our little portion of oneness is given a name, is told all kinds of things about itself, and these details, opinions, and ideas become facts.": 1,
    " which go towards building ourselves, our identity.": 1,
    "And that self becomes the vehicle for navigating our social world.": 1,
    "But the self is a projection": 1,
    " based on other people's projections, is it who we really are or who we really want to be or should be?": 1,
    " So this whole interaction with self and identity was a very difficult one for me growing up.": 1,
    "The self that I attempted to take out into the world was rejected over and over again.": 1,
    "And my panic": 1,
    " but not having a self that fit.": 1,
    "And the confusion that came from myself being rejected created anxiety, shame, and hopelessness, which kind of defined me for a long time.": 1,
    " But in retrospect, the destruction of myself was so repetitive that I started to see a pattern.": 1,
    "The self changed, got affected, broken, destroyed, but another one would evolve.": 1,
    " sometimes stronger, sometimes hateful, sometimes not wanting to be there at all.": 1,
    "The self was not constant.": 1,
    " And how many times would myself have to die before I realized that it was never alive in the first place?": 1,
    " I grew up on the coast of England in the 70s.": 1,
    "My dad is white from Cornwall and my mum is black from Zimbabwe.": 1,
    " Even the idea of us as a family was challenging to most people.": 1,
    "But nature had its wicked way and brown babies were born.": 1,
    " But from about the age of five, I was aware that I didn't fit.": 1,
    " I was the black atheist kid in the all-white Catholic school run by nuns.": 1,
    "I was an anomaly.": 1,
    "And myself was rooting around for definition, trying to plug in.": 1,
    " because the self likes to fit.": 1,
    " to see itself replicated, to belong.": 1,
    "That confirms its existence and its importance.": 1,
    "And it is important.": 1,
    "It has an extremely important function.": 1,
    "Without it, we literally can't interface with others.": 1,
    " We can't hatch plans and climb that stairway of popularity, of success.": 1,
    " but my skin color wasn't right.": 1,
    " My hair wasn't right.": 1,
    "My history wasn't right.": 1,
    "My self became defined by otherness, which meant that in that social world, I didn't really exist.": 1,
    " And I was other before being anything else, even before being a girl.": 1,
    " I was a noticeable nobody.": 1,
    " Another world was opening up around this time, performance and dancing.": 1,
    " That nagging dread of self-hood didn't exist when I was dancing.": 1,
    "I'd literally lose myself.": 1,
    "And I was a really good dancer.": 1,
    " I would put all my emotional expression into my dancing.": 1,
    "I could be in the movement.": 1,
    " in a way that I wasn't able to be in my real life, in myself.": 1,
    "And at 16, I stumbled across another opportunity and I earned my first acting role in a film.": 1,
    " I can hardly find the words to describe the peace I felt when I was acting.": 1,
    "My dysfunctional self could actually plug in to another self, not my own, and it felt so good.": 1,
    " It was the first time that I existed inside a fully functioning self, one that I controlled, that I steered, that I gave life to.": 1,
    " But the shooting day would end, and I'd return to my gnarly, awkward self.": 1,
    " By 19...": 1,
    " I was a fully fledged movie actor, but still searching for definition.": 1,
    " I applied to read anthropology at university.": 1,
    " Dr Phyllis Lee gave me my interview and she asked me, how would you define race?": 1,
    "Well, I thought I had the answer to that one.": 1,
    "And I said, skin colour.": 1,
    "So, biology, genetics, she said.": 1,
    " Because, Tandi, that's not accurate because there's actually more genetic difference between a black Kenyan and a black Ugandan than there is between a black Kenyan and, say, a white Norwegian.": 1,
    " Because we all stem from Africa, so in Africa, there's been more time to create genetic diversity.": 1,
    "In other words, race has no basis in biological or scientific fact.": 1,
    " On the one hand, result, right?": 1,
    " On the other hand, my definition of self just lost a huge chunk of its credibility.": 1,
    "But what was credible, what is biological and scientific fact, is that we all stem from Africa.": 1,
    " In fact, from a woman called Mitochondrial Eve who lived 160,000 years ago.": 1,
    "And race is an illegitimate concept which ourselves have created based on fear and ignorance.": 1,
    " Strangely, these revelations didn't cure my low self-esteem.": 1,
    "That feeling of otherness": 1,
    " My desire to disappear was still very powerful.": 1,
    "I had a degree from Cambridge.": 1,
    "I had a thriving career, but myself was a car crash.": 1,
    " and I wound up with bulimia and on a therapist couch.": 1,
    "And of course I did.": 1,
    " I still believed myself was all I was.": 1,
    "I still valued self-worth above all other worth.": 1,
    "And what was there to suggest otherwise?": 1,
    " We've created entire value systems and a physical reality to support the worth of self.": 1,
    "Look at the industry for self-image and the jobs it creates, the revenue it turns over.": 1,
    " We'd be right in assuming that the self is an actual living thing, but it's not.": 1,
    "It's a projection which our clever brains create in order to cheat ourselves from the reality of death.": 1,
    " But there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection.": 1,
    "And that thing is oneness, our essence.": 1,
    " The self's struggle for authenticity and definition will never end unless it's connected to its creator, to you and to me.": 1,
    " And that can happen with awareness.": 1,
    "Awareness of the reality of oneness and the projection of selfhood.": 1,
    " For a start, we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves.": 1,
    "It happens when I dance, when I'm acting.": 1,
    " I'm earthed in my essence and myself is suspended.": 1,
    " In those moments, I'm connected to everything.": 1,
    "The ground, the air, the sounds, the energy from the audience.": 1,
    "All my senses are alert and alive.": 1,
    " in much the same way as an infant might feel, that feeling of oneness.": 1,
    " And when I'm acting a role, I inhabit another self, and I give it life for a while.": 1,
    "Because when the self is suspended, so is divisiveness and judgment.": 1,
    " and I've played everything from vengeful ghost in the time of slavery to secretary of state in 2004.": 1,
    " And no matter how other these selves might be, they're all related in me.": 1,
    " And I honestly believe the key to my success as an actor and my progress as a person has been the very lack of self that used to make me feel so anxious and insecure.": 1,
    " I always wondered why I could feel others' pain so deeply, why I could recognize the somebody in the nobody.": 1,
    " It's because I didn't have a self to get in the way.": 1,
    " I thought I lacked substance, and the fact that I could feel others meant that I had nothing of myself to feel.": 1,
    " the thing that was a source of shame.": 1,
    " was actually a source of enlightenment.": 1,
    "And when I realized and really understood that myself is a projection and that it has a function, a funny thing happened.": 1,
    "I stopped giving it so much authority.": 1,
    " I give it its due.": 1,
    "I take it to therapy.": 1,
    "I've become very familiar with its dysfunctional behavior.": 1,
    "But I'm not ashamed of myself.": 1,
    "In fact, I respect myself and its function.": 1,
    " And over time, and with practice, I've tried to live more and more from my essence.": 1,
    "And if you can do that, incredible things happen.": 1,
    " I was in Congo in February, dancing and celebrating with women who've survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways.": 1,
    " destroyed because other brutalized psychopathic selves all over that beautiful land are fueling ourselves addiction to iPods, pads and bling.": 1,
    " which further disconnect ourselves from ever feeling their pain, their suffering, their death.": 1,
    "Because hey, if we're all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life,": 1,
    " then we're devaluing and desensitizing life.": 1,
    "And in that disconnected state, yeah, we can build factory farms with no windows, destroy marine life, and use rape as a weapon of war.": 1,
    " So here's a note to self.": 1,
    " The cracks have started to show in our constructed world.": 1,
    " and oceans will continue to surge through the cracks and oil and blood, rivers of it.": 1,
    " Crucially, we haven't been figuring out how to live in oneness with the earth and every other living thing.": 1,
    "We've just been insanely trying to figure out how to live with each other, billions of each other.": 1,
    " Only we're not living with each other.": 1,
    "Our crazy selves are living with each other and perpetuating an epidemic of disconnection.": 1,
    " Let's live with each other.": 1,
    " and take it a breath at a time.": 1,
    " if we can get under that heavy self.": 1,
    " Light a torch of awareness and find our essence, our connection to the infinite and every other living thing.": 1,
    "We knew it from the day we were born.": 1,
    "Let's not be freaked out by our bountiful nothingness.": 1,
    " It's more a reality than the ones ourselves have created.": 1,
    " Imagine what kind of existence we can have if we honor inevitable death of self.": 1,
    " appreciate the privilege of life, and marvel at what comes next.": 1,
    " Simple awareness is where it begins.": 1,
    " Thank you for listening.": 1
