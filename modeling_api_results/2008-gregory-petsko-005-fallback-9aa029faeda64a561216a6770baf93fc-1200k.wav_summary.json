    " Unless we do something to prevent it, over the next 40 years we're facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale.": 1,
    " A cheery thought.": 1,
    " On this map, every country that's colored blue has more than 20% of its population over the age of 65.": 1,
    "This is the world we live in.": 1,
    "And this is the world your children will live in.": 1,
    " For 12,000 years, the distribution of ages in the human population has looked like a pyramid with the oldest on top.": 1,
    "It's already flattening out.": 1,
    "By 2050, it's going to be a column, and we'll start to invert.": 1,
    "This is why it's happening.": 1,
    " The average lifespan's more than doubled since 1840, and it's increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day.": 1,
    " And this is why that's not entirely a good thing.": 1,
    "Because over the age of 65, your risk of getting Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease will increase exponentially.": 1,
    " By 2050, there'll be about 32 million people in the United States over the age of 80, and unless we do something about it, half of them will have Alzheimer's disease and 3 million more will have Parkinson's disease.": 1,
    " Right now, those and other neurologic diseases for which we have no cure or prevention cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year.": 1,
    "It'll be well over a trillion dollars by 2050.": 1,
    " Alzheimer's disease starts when a protein that should be folded up properly misfolds into a kind of demented origami.": 1,
    " So one approach we're taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular scotch tape to hold the protein into its proper shape.": 1,
    " That would keep it from forming the tangles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do.": 1,
    "Interestingly enough, other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain": 1,
    " also show tangles of misfolded protein, which suggests that the approach might be a general one and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases, not just Alzheimer's disease.": 1,
    "There's also a fascinating connection to cancer here": 1,
    " because people with neurologic diseases have a very low incidence of most cancers.": 1,
    "And this is a connection that most people aren't pursuing right now, but which we're fascinated by.": 1,
    " Most of the important and all of the creative work in this area is being funded by private philanthropies.": 1,
    "And there's tremendous scope for additional private help here because the government has dropped the ball on much of this, I'm afraid.": 1,
    " In the meantime, while we're waiting for all these things to happen, here's what you can do for yourself.": 1,
    "If you want to lower your risk of Parkinson's disease, caffeine is protective to some extent.": 1,
    "Nobody knows why.": 1,
    " Head injuries are bad for you, they lead to Parkinson's disease, and the avian flu is also not a good idea.": 1,
    " As far as protecting yourself against Alzheimer's disease, well it turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for Alzheimer's disease.": 1,
    "You should also keep your blood pressure down because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.": 1,
    " It's also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma, which is just Alzheimer's disease of the eye.": 1,
    "And of course, when it comes to cognitive effects, use it or lose it applies, so you want to stay mentally stimulated, but hey, you're listening to me.": 1,
    " So you've got that covered.": 1,
    "And one final thing.": 1,
    "Wish people like me luck, okay?": 1,
    "Because the clock is ticking for all of us.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
