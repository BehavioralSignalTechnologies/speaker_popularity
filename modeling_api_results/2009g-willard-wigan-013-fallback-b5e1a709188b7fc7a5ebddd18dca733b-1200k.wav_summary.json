    " There's an old saying, just because you can't see something doesn't mean it's not there.": 1,
    " My work is a reflection of myself.": 1,
    "What I wanted to do is to": 1,
    " show the world that the little things can be the biggest things.": 1,
    " We all seem to think that if we look down on the ground, there's nothing there.": 1,
    "And we use the word nothing.": 1,
    " Nothing doesn't exist because there's always something.": 1,
    "My mother told me that when I was a child that I should always respect the little things.": 1,
    " What made me do this work?": 1,
    "I shall go into my story.": 1,
    "This all started when I was age five.": 1,
    "What made me do it?": 1,
    " At school, I will admit this, academically I couldn't express myself, so I was more or less classed as nothing, so my world was seen as less.": 1,
    " So I decided I didn't really want to be a part of that world.": 1,
    "So I thought I need to retreat.": 1,
    " into something else.": 1,
    "So one mother used to take me to school.": 1,
    " She thought I was at school and I used to do a U-turn when her back was turned and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden.": 1,
    " Now, the one time I was in the shed and...": 1,
    " My mother suspected something, thinking I was at school.": 1,
    "And my mother was like the woman in Tom and Jerry.": 1,
    "So you just see her feet.": 1,
    " So I was hiding in the shed, like that, and all of a sudden...": 1,
    " And then I saw her legs and then she said, grab me like that because my mother's quite big and she lifted me up and she says,": 1,
    " coming up at school and I told her I couldn't face it because the way the teacher was treating me, ridiculing me and using me as an example of failure so I told her": 1,
    " But at that age, obviously I couldn't really express it that way, but I told her I didn't feel right.": 1,
    "And then she just said, you're going back to school tomorrow, and walked off, and I didn't expect that, because I expected one of these.": 1,
    " but I didn't get it.": 1,
    "So I'm sitting there thinking.": 1,
    " And then as I look down on the ground,": 1,
    " I noticed there were some ants rolling around.": 1,
    " and I went into this little fantasy world and I thought...": 1,
    " Are they looking for the queen ant?": 1,
    "Or did I need somewhere to live?": 1,
    "So I thought, perhaps if I make these ants some apartments...": 1,
    " they'll move in.": 1,
    " So I did.": 1,
    " And how I set about that, I got some splinters of wood, and I sliced these little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass, constructed this little apartment.": 1,
    " It looked like a little shanty shed when I finished but I thought perhaps the ant won't know it'll probably move in and so I did.": 1,
    "That was a bit crude at the time and I made all these little apartments and little merry-go-round, seesaws and swings, little ladders.": 1,
    " and then I encouraged the ants to come round by putting sugar and things like that and then I sat down and all the ants came along and all I could hear was": 1,
    " Is this for us?": 1,
    "And I said, yes, they're all for you.": 1,
    "And they moved in and decided not to pay me any rent.": 1,
    " From there, I was watching this little world and it became a part of me.": 1,
    " when I discovered that I had this gift.": 1,
    " I wanted to experiment with": 1,
    " this world that we can't see.": 1,
    "So I realized that there was more to life than just everything that we see around us.": 1,
    "That's huge.": 1,
    "So I started to educate myself on this molecular level.": 1,
    " And as I got older, I continued.": 1,
    "I showed my mother.": 1,
    "My mother told me to take it smaller.": 1,
    "Now, I shall show you something here, and I'll explain.": 1,
    " As you can see.": 1,
    " That's a pinhead.": 1,
    " Now, that is called the Hough House.": 1,
    "The gentleman who commissioned me to do this was a gentleman called Peter Hough.": 1,
    " And he says to me, Willard, can you put my house on a pinhead?": 1,
    " So I says, how are you going to fit in there?": 1,
    " And then he said to me,": 1,
    " I don't believe you can do it.": 1,
    "Can you really do it?": 1,
    "And I says, well.": 1,
    " try me.": 1,
    "And then he said, but I don't believe that you can do this.": 1,
    " So I said, OK.": 1,
    "So I cut a long story short.": 1,
    "I went home, went underneath the microscope, and I crushed up a piece of glass, crushed it up.": 1,
    " And underneath the microscope there were splinters of glass.": 1,
    "Some of them were quite jagged.": 1,
    "So I was crushing up these pieces of glass, which as you can see that is the actual frame of the house.": 1,
    " and um...": 1,
    " The actual roof is made up of a fibre which I found in my sister's old teddy bear.": 1,
    " So I got the teddy bear and I said, do you mind if I pull out one of your fibres?": 1,
    "So I did.": 1,
    "And I looked at it with the microscope and some of it was flat.": 1,
    "So I decided to slice these up with the tools that I make.": 1,
    " I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade and then I actually slow down my whole nervous system and then I work between my heartbeat.": 1,
    " and I have one and a half seconds to actually move.": 1,
    " and at the same time I have to watch I don't inhale my own work at the same time.": 1,
    " Because that has happened to me.": 1,
    " So what I did, like I said, come back to the glass.": 1,
    "I found these little bits of glass and I had to make them square.": 1,
    "So I'm thinking, how can I do this?": 1,
    "So what I did, I got a oilstone, broke the edge of an oilstone off.": 1,
    " And what I did, I took pieces of glass and I started to rub them.": 1,
    "I used a little tweezer which I made from an air clip and I built up rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn't crush the glass.": 1,
    "And then I started rubbing very, very gently.": 1,
    " till some of the edges were quite square and then I constructed it and how I constructed it is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead and then pushing the glass in with its own friction and as I was doing it": 1,
    " What happened?": 1,
    "The instrument that I used turned into a catapult and it went like this.": 1,
    " And then that was it.": 1,
    " gone.": 1,
    " So I'm thinking Mr. Hough isn't going to be very happy when I told him his house has gone to another, into the atmosphere somewhere.": 1,
    " So, cut the story short, I decided that I had to go back and do it, so I found some more and I decided to sort of construct it very, very slowly, holding my breath, working between my heartbeat and making sure everything's level, because it's such a...": 1,
    " a small sculpture yet nothing can go wrong.": 1,
    "And I decided to build it up then I used fibres out of my jumper.": 1,
    " which I held and stretched and made the beams going around the house and the actual windows and the balcony had to be sort of constructed.": 1,
    "I used money spiders web to actually attach certain things which sent me insane.": 1,
    " But I managed to do it.": 1,
    "And when I finished it, I came back the next day and the house was occupied.": 1,
    " Have we ever heard of a dust mite?": 1,
    " Darren Dusmight and his family moved in.": 1,
    " So basically I'd completed the house and there you are.": 1,
    " Right, as you can see Bart Simpson is having a little argument.": 1,
    " I think they're arguing about the space on the pin.": 1,
    " There's not enough room for the two of them.": 1,
    "So I didn't think he was going to throw a bard off.": 1,
    "I think he was just warning him, actually.": 1,
    "But this one was made out of a nylon tag out of my shirt.": 1,
    " What I did, I plucked the tag out and put it underneath the microscope.": 1,
    "I used a needle, which has got a slight blade on the end.": 1,
    "Can anybody see the blade on the end of that needle?": 1,
    " So what I did is the same process where I just kind of hold my breath and just work away.": 1,
    " very, very slowly manipulating the plastic, cutting it, because it behaves different.": 1,
    "Whenever you work on that level, things behave different, because it's on this molecular level, things change and they act different.": 1,
    " And sometimes they turn it into little catapults and things go up in the air and, you know, that all different things happen.": 1,
    "But I had to make a little barrier going around it out of cellophane to stop it moving.": 1,
    "Then static electricity set in and it went...": 1,
    " And I'm trying to remove it and the static's interfering with everything so, you know, the sweat dripping off my head because I have to carve Omer Simpson like that in that position.": 1,
    " and after I've cut out the shape then I have to make sure that there's room for Bart's neck so after I've done the same thing then I have to paint it and after I've actually sculpted them I have to paint them": 1,
    " I experimented with a, I found a dead fly and I plucked the hair off the fly's head, decided to make a paintbrush.": 1,
    " But I would never do it to a living fly.": 1,
    " because...": 1,
    " I've heard a fly in pain and they go": 1,
    " even though they get on our nerves I would never kill an insect because you know all creatures great and small you know there's a hymn that says that so what I decided to do is to pluck": 1,
    " fine hair out of my face.": 1,
    " And I looked at it underneath the microscope, that was the paintbrush.": 1,
    "And whilst I'm painting, I have to be very careful because the paint starts to turn into little blobs and it starts to...": 1,
    " dry very quickly, so I have to be very quick.": 1,
    "If I'm not, it'll end up looking not like what it's supposed to look like.": 1,
    "It could end up looking like umpty dumpty.": 1,
    " or somebody else.": 1,
    "So I have to be very, very careful.": 1,
    "So this one took me approximately, I would say, six to seven weeks.": 1,
    "My work": 1,
    " rough estimates sometimes five six to seven weeks you can't always anticipate": 1,
    " As you can see, that's Charlton Heston brought down to size.": 1,
    " He says to me, Willard, as you can see him saying...": 1,
    " Why me?": 1,
    "I said, I enjoyed your film, that's why.": 1,
    "As you can see, there's an aphid fly there, that's just to show the scale and the actual size of the sculpture.": 1,
    " I would say it probably measures a quarter of a millimetre.": 1,
    "In America they say a period stop.": 1,
    "So I would say if you cut a period stop in aft,": 1,
    " That's about the size of the whole thing.": 1,
    " The chariot is made of gold and Charlton Heston is made of floating fibre which I took out the air.": 1,
    "When the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibres and what I normally do is walk around the room": 1,
    " trying to find one.": 1,
    " and then I put it in the microscope.": 1,
    "I remember one time I was doing it and the window was open and there was a lady standing by the bus stop and she saw me walking around like this.": 1,
    " Then she looked at me, and then I went.": 1,
    " And then she went, oh, OK, he's not mad.": 1,
    "To actually do this thing, the actual chariot is made of gold.": 1,
    "I had a 24-karat gold ring, and I cut off a little flake of gold, and then I bent it round.": 1,
    " and made it into the chariot and the horse is made from nylon and the spider's web is for the reins on the horse.": 1,
    "To get the symmetrical shape of the horse was very difficult.": 1,
    " because I had to get the horse to rear up and look as though it was sort of in some kind of action.": 1,
    "When I did this one, a gentleman seen it and said to me, there's no way you can do this, you must have used some kind of machine, there's no way a man can do that.": 1,
    " It must be a machine.": 1,
    "So I said, okay, then if you say it's a machine.": 1,
    " That one took me approximately six weeks.": 1,
    " the most famous statue in the world.": 1,
    " This one, I would say, was a serious challenge because...": 1,
    " Laughter.": 1,
    " because I had to put the torch on the top.": 1,
    " That one is more or less the same type of process.": 1,
    "The bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand.": 1,
    " because I wanted to get a bit of a stone effect.": 1,
    "I used a microscopic shard of diamond to actually carve the actual base.": 1,
    "Well, I can look at this one and I can be very proud of this because that statue has always sort of kept an image in my head of": 1,
    " you know, the beginning of people coming to America so it's sort of early silent and seeing America for the first time and that's the first thing they saw so I wanted to have that little image and this is it.": 1,
    " And we all know that is the Hulk.": 1,
    "I wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle because as we know we see needles but people are not familiar with the eye of a needle but apart from putting the thread through it.": 1,
    "So I broke the needle and": 1,
    " made the needle look like the hawk's broken it.": 1,
    " I had to make little holes in the base of the needle to shove his feet in.": 1,
    "So most of my work, I don't use glue.": 1,
    "They're going with their own friction.": 1,
    "And that's how I managed to do it.": 1,
    "As you can see, he's looking at the moment.": 1,
    "He's got little grimace on his face.": 1,
    " His mouth must be probably about three microns.": 1,
    "So the eyes are probably about one micron or something.": 1,
    " That chip there...": 1,
    " that's made from 24 karat gold and I normally rig it with the web of a money spider but I had to rig it with strands of glue because the web of the spider it was": 1,
    " sending me insane because I couldn't get the web to move off and that's 24 karat gold and it's constructed, I built it, constructed each plank of gold.": 1,
    " and the whole thing is sort of symmetrical.": 1,
    "The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold.": 1,
    "You know, it's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right.": 1,
    " As you can see, dressage.": 1,
    "It's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape, the actual rigging on the reins on the horse made from the same sort of thing.": 1,
    " and that was done with a particle from my shirt and the pinhead I've made greenery on there by": 1,
    " scraping the particles off a green shirt and then pressed onto the needle.": 1,
    "It's very painstaking work, but the best things come in small packages.": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1
