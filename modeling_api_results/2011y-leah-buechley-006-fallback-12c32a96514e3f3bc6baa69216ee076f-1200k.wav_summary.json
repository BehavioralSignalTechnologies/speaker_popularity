    " I'm sorry.": 2,
    " You.": 2,
    " Today I'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics.": 1,
    " I'm, among several other things, an electrical engineer.": 1,
    "And that means that I spend a good amount of time designing and building new pieces of technology.": 1,
    " and more specifically designing and building electronics.": 1,
    "And what I've found is that the process of designing and building electronics is": 1,
    " problematic in all sorts of ways.": 1,
    "So it's a really slow process.": 1,
    "It's really expensive.": 1,
    "And the outcome of that process, namely electronic circuit boards, are": 1,
    " limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways.": 1,
    "So they're really small generally.": 1,
    "They're square and flat.": 1,
    " and hard, and frankly, most of them just aren't very attractive.": 1,
    "And so my team and I have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up the process and the outcome": 1,
    " of designing electronics.": 1,
    "And so what if you could design and build electronics like this?": 1,
    " So what if you could do it extremely quickly, extremely inexpensively, and maybe more interestingly,": 1,
    " fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally, wouldn't that be so cool and wouldn't that open up all sorts of new possibilities?": 1,
    " I'm going to share with you two projects that are investigations along these lines, and we'll start with this one.": 1,
    " Pretty cool, huh?": 1,
    "We think so.": 1,
    "So now that we developed these tools and found these materials that let us do these things, we started to realize that": 1,
    " essentially anything that we can do with paper, anything that we can do with a piece of paper and a pen, we can now do with electronics.": 1,
    " So the next project that I want to show you is kind of a deeper exploration of that possibility.": 1,
    "And I'll kind of let it speak for itself.": 1,
    " So the next step for us in this process is now to find a way to let all of you build things like this.": 1,
    " And so the way that we're approaching that is by teaching workshops to people where we explain how they can use these kinds of tools.": 1,
    " And then also working to get the tools and the materials and techniques kind of out into the real world in a variety of ways.": 1,
    "And so sometime soon you'll be able to play and build and sketch.": 1,
    " with electronics in this fundamentally new way.": 1,
    "So thank you very much.": 1
