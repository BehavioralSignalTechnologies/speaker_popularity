    " They allow us to go where we want to and we want to.": 1,
    " pride of ownership.": 1,
    "Songs are written about cars.": 1,
    "A prince wrote a great song, Little Red Corvette.": 1,
    "He didn't write Little Red Laptop": 1,
    " computer or a little red dirt devil he wrote about a car.": 1,
    "And one of my favorites has always been make love to your man in the Chevy van because that was my vehicle when I was in college.": 1,
    "The fact is when we do our market research around the world": 1,
    " we see that there's nearly a universal aspiration on the part of people to own an automobile.": 1,
    "And 750 million people in the world today own a car.": 1,
    "And you say, boy, that's a lot.": 1,
    "But you know what?": 1,
    " that's just 12% of the population.": 1,
    "We really have to ask the question, can the world sustain that number of automobiles?": 1,
    "And if you look at projections over the next 10 to 15 to 20 years, it looks like the World Car Park": 1,
    " could grow to on the order of 1.1 billion vehicles.": 1,
    "Now if you park those end to end and wrap them around the earth,": 1,
    " That would stretch around the earth 125 times.": 1,
    "Now we've made great progress with automobile technology over the last hundred years.": 1,
    "Cars are dramatically cleaner, dramatically safer.": 1,
    " more efficient and radically more affordable than they were 100 years ago.": 1,
    "But the fact remains, the fundamental DNA of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same.": 1,
    "If we were going to reinvent the automobile today,": 1,
    " rather than a hundred years ago, knowing what we know about the issues associated with our product and about the technologies that exist today, what would we do?": 1,
    "We wanted something that was really affordable.": 1,
    "The fuel cell looked great.": 1,
    " One tenth as many moving parts in a fuel cell propulsion system as an internal combustion engine, and it emits just water.": 1,
    "And we wanted to take advantage of Moore's law with electronic controls and software, and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected.": 1,
    " So we embarked upon the reinvention around an electrochemical engine, the fuel cell.": 1,
    "Hydrogen is the energy carrier.": 1,
    "First was autonomy.": 1,
    " autonomy really set the vision for where we wanted to head.": 1,
    "We embodied all of the key components of a fuel cell propulsion system.": 1,
    "We then had autonomy drivable with high wire and we showed high wire": 1,
    " here at this conference last year.": 1,
    "High wire is the world's first drivable fuel cell and we have followed up that now with Sequel and Sequel truly is a real car.": 1,
    "So if we could run the video.": 1,
    " You're welcome.": 1,
    " Absolutely.": 1,
    " That's my last one, thank you.": 1,
    "It truly is my great pleasure to introduce Sequel.": 1,
    " But the real key question, I'm sure it's on your mind, where's the hydrogen going to come from?": 1,
    "And secondly, when are these kinds of cars going to be available?": 1,
    "So let me talk about hydrogen first.": 1,
    " The beauty of hydrogen is it can come from so many different sources.": 1,
    "It can come from fossil fuels.": 1,
    "It can come from any way that you can create electricity, including renewables.": 1,
    "And it can come from biofuels, and that's quite exciting.": 1,
    " The vision here is to have each local community play to its natural strength in creating the hydrogen.": 1,
    "A lot of hydrogen is produced today in the world.": 1,
    "It's produced to get sulfur out of gasoline, which I find is somewhat ironic.": 1,
    "It's produced in the": 1,
    " fertilizer industry is produced in the chemical manufacturing industry.": 1,
    "That hydrogen is being made because there's a good business reason for its use.": 1,
    " But it tells us that we know how to create it, we know how to create it cost-effectively, we know how to handle it safely.": 1,
    " We did an analysis where you would have a station in each city with each of the hundred largest cities in the United States and located the station so you'd be no more than two miles from a station at any time.": 1,
    " We put one every 25 miles on the freeway, and it turns out that translates into about 12,000 stations.": 1,
    "And at a million dollars each, that would be about $12 billion.": 1,
    "Now, that's a lot of money.": 1,
    " But if you built the Alaskan pipeline today, that's half of what the Alaskan pipeline would cost.": 1,
    "But the real exciting vision that we see truly is home refueling, much like recharging your laptop or recharging your cell phone.": 1,
    " So we're pretty excited about the future of hydrogen.": 1,
    "We think it's a question of not a weather but a question of when.": 1,
    "What we've targeted for ourselves, and we're making great progress toward this goal,": 1,
    " is to have a propulsion system based on hydrogen and fuel cells designed and validated that can go head to head with the internal combustion engine.": 1,
    "We're talking about obsoleting the internal combustion engine.": 1,
    " and do it in terms of its affordability at scale volumes, its performance and its durability.": 1,
    "So that's what we're driving to for 2010.": 1,
    "We haven't seen anything yet in our development work that says that is impossible.": 1,
    " We actually think the future is going to be event driven.": 1,
    "So since we can't predict the future, we want to spend a lot of our time trying to create that future.": 1,
    "I'm very, very intrigued by the fact that our cars and trucks sit idle 90% of the time.": 1,
    " They're parked.": 1,
    "They're parked all around us.": 1,
    "They're usually parked within 100 feet of the people that own them.": 1,
    "Now, if you take the power generating capability of an automobile,": 1,
    " and you compare that to the electric grid in the United States, it turns out that 4% of the automobiles, the power in 4% of the automobiles, equals that of the electric grid of the U.S.": 1,
    " That's a huge power generating capability, a mobile power generating capability, and hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity to actually use our cars and trucks when they're parked to generate electricity for the grid.": 1,
    " And we talked about swarm networks earlier, talking about the ultimate swarm, about having all of the processors and all of the cars when they're sitting idle being part of a global grid.": 1,
    " for computing capability.": 1,
    "We find that premise quite exciting.": 1,
    "The automobile becomes then an appliance, not in a commodity sense, but an appliance, mobile power, mobile platform for information and computing and communication.": 1,
    " as well as a form of transportation.": 1,
    "And the key to all of this is to make it affordable, to make it exciting, to get it on a pathway where there's a way to make money doing it.": 1,
    " And again, this is a pretty big march to take here.": 1,
    "And a lot of people say, how do you sleep at night when you're wrestling with a problem of that magnitude?": 1,
    "And I tell them, I sleep like a baby.": 1,
    "I wake up crying every two hours.": 1,
    " Actually, the theme in this conference, I think, has hit on really one of the major keys to pull that off, and that's relationships and working together.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1,
    " Larry, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.": 1,
    "Larry, wait, wait one sec.": 1,
    " I've got so many questions I could ask you.": 1,
    "I just want to ask one.": 1,
    "I could be wrong about this, but my sense is that in the public mind today that GM is not viewed as": 1,
    " serious about some of these environmental ideas, some of your Japanese competitors, maybe even as Ford.": 1,
    " Are you serious about it?": 1,
    "And not just when the consumers want it, when the regulators force us to do it, we will go there?": 1,
    "Are you guys going to really try and show leadership on this?": 1,
    " Yeah, we're absolutely serious.": 1,
    "We're into this over a billion dollars already, so I would hope people would think we're serious when we're spending that kind of money.": 1,
    " And secondly, it's a fundamental business proposition.": 1,
    "I'll be honest with you, we're into it because of business growth opportunities.": 1,
    "We can't grow our business unless we solve these problems.": 1,
    "The growth of the auto industry will be capped by sustainability issues if we don't solve the problems.": 1,
    " And there's a simple principle of strategy that says, do unto yourself before others do unto you.": 1,
    "If we can see this possible future, others can too.": 1,
    "And we want to be the first one to create it, Chris.": 1
