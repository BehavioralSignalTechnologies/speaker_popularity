    " I'm here today to show my photographs of the Lakota.": 1,
    "How many of you may have heard of the Lakota, or at least the larger group of tribes called the Sioux?": 1,
    " The Lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land to prisoner of war camps, now called reservations.": 1,
    "The Pine Ridge Reservation,": 1,
    " The subject of today's slideshow is located about 75 miles southeast of the Black Hills in South Dakota.": 1,
    "It is sometimes referred to as prisoner of war camp number 334 and is where the Lakota now live.": 1,
    " Now if any of you have ever heard of AIM, the American Indian Movement, or of Russell Means, or Leonard Peltier,": 1,
    " or at the standoff at Oglala, then you know that Pine Ridge is ground zero for Native issues in the U.S.": 1,
    " So I've been asked to talk a little bit today about my relationship with a Lakota.": 1,
    "And that's a very difficult one for me, because if you haven't noticed from my skin color, I'm white.": 1,
    "And that is a huge barrier on a native reservation.": 1,
    " You'll see a lot of people in my photographs today, and I've become very close with them, and they've welcomed me like family.": 1,
    "They've called me brother and uncle, and invited me again and again over five years.": 1,
    "But on Pine Ridge, I will always be what is called Washichu.": 1,
    " Washichu is a Lakota word.": 1,
    " That means non-Indian, but another version of this word means the one who takes the best meat for himself.": 1,
    "And that's what I want to focus on, the one who takes the best part of the meat.": 1,
    "It means greedy.": 1,
    " So take a look around this auditorium today.": 1,
    "We are at a private school in the American West, sitting in red velvet chairs with money in our pockets.": 1,
    " And if we look at our lives, we have indeed taken the best part of the meat.": 1,
    "So let's look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain and know that when you see these people's faces,": 1,
    " that these are not just images of Lakota.": 1,
    "They stand for all indigenous people.": 1,
    " On this piece of paper is the history, the way I learned it from my Lakota friends and family.": 1,
    " The following is a timeline of treaties made, treaties broken, and massacres disguised as battles.": 1,
    " I'll begin in 1824.": 1,
    "What is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs was created within the War Department, setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the Native Americans.": 1,
    " 1851, the first treaty of Fort Laramie was made, clearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota Nation.": 1,
    "According to the treaty, those lands are a sovereign nation.": 1,
    " If the boundaries of this treaty had held, and there is a legal basis that they should, then this is what the US would look like today.": 1,
    " Ten years later, the Homestead Act, signed by President Lincoln, unleashed a flood of white settlers into native lands.": 1,
    " 1863, an uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota ends with the hanging of 38 Sioux men, the largest mass execution in U.S.": 1,
    "history.": 1,

    " after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation.": 1,

    " We appropriated land for trails and trains to shortcut through the heart of the Lakota nation.": 1,
    "The treaties were out the window.": 1,
    "In response, three tribes led by the Lakota chief, Red Cloud, attacked and defeated the U.S.": 1,
    "Army many times over.": 1,
    " I want to repeat that part.": 1,
    "The Lakota defeat the U.S.": 1,
    "Army.": 1,
    " 1868, the Second Fort Laramie Treaty clearly guarantees the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation and the Lakota's ownership of the sacred Black Hills.": 1,
    " The government also promises land and hunting rights in the surrounding states.": 1,
    "We promise that the Powder River Country will henceforth be closed to all whites.": 1,
    " The treaty seemed to be a complete victory for Red Cloud and the Sioux.": 1,
    "In fact, this is the only war in American history in which the government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by the enemy.": 1,
    " 1869, the Transcontinental Railroad was completed.": 1,
    "It began carrying, among other things, large numbers of hunters who began the wholesale killing of buffalo, eliminating a source of food, clothing, and shelter for the Sioux.": 1,
    " 1871, the Indian Appropriation Act makes all Indians wards of the federal government.": 1,
    "In addition, the military issued orders forbidding Western Indians from leaving reservations.": 1,
    " All Western Indians at that point in time were now prisoners of war.": 1,
    "Also in 1871, we ended the time of treaty making.": 1,
    "The problem with treaties is that they allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations, and we can't have that.": 1,

    "He was later killed while in custody.": 1,
    " 1877 is also the year we found a way to get around the Fort Laramie treaties.": 1,
    "A new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men under a campaign known as Cellar Starve.": 1,
    " Sign the paper or no food for your tribe.": 1,

    "Communal ownership of reservation lands ends.": 1,
    "Reservations are cut up into 160 acre sections and distributed to individual Indians with a surplus disposed of.": 1,
    " Tribes lost millions of acres.": 1,
    " The American dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was left.": 1,
    " The move destroyed the reservations, making it easier to further subdivide and to sell with every passing generation.": 1,
    "Most of the surplus land and many of the plots within reservation boundaries are now in the hands of white ranchers.": 1,
    " Once again, the fad of the land goes to Washitu.": 1,
    " 1890, a date I believe to be the most important in this slideshow.": 1,
    "This is the year of the Woundedy Massacre.": 1,
    " On December 29th, U.S.": 1,
    "troops surrounded a Sioux encampment at Wounded Knee Creek and massacred Chief Bigfoot and 300 prisoners of war using a new rapid-fire weapon that fired exploding shells called a Hotchkiss gun.": 1,

    " to this day.": 1,
    " This is the most medals of honor ever awarded for a single battle.": 1,

    " The Woundedie Massacre is considered the end of the Indian Wars.": 1,
    " Whenever I visit the site of the mass grave, a wounded knee, I see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or for the Sioux, but as a grave for all indigenous peoples.": 1,
    " The holy man Black Elk said, I did not know then how much was ended.": 1,
    " When I look back now from this high hill of my old age, I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch.": 1,
    " as plain as when I saw them with eyes still young.": 1,
    " and I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud.": 1,
    " and was buried in the blizzard.": 1,
    " A people's dream died there.": 1,
    " And it was a beautiful dream.": 1,
    " With this event, a new era in Native American history began.": 1,
    " Everything can be measured before wounded knee and after, because it was in this moment, with the fingers on the triggers of the Hotchkiss guns, that the U.S.": 1,
    "government openly declared its position on Native rights.": 1,
    " They were tired of treaties.": 1,
    "They were tired of sacred hills.": 1,
    "They were tired of ghost dances.": 1,
    " and they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux.": 1,
    " So they brought out their cannons.": 1,
    " You want to be an Indian now, they said.": 1,
    "Finger on the trigger.": 1,
    " The U.S.": 1,
    "Indian population reached its low point, less than 250,000, compared to an estimated 8 million in 1492.": 1,
    " Fast forward, 1980, the longest running court case in US history, the Sioux Nation versus the United States was ruled upon by the US Supreme Court.": 1,
    " The court determined that when the suvery settled under reservations and seven million acres of their land were opened up to prospectors and homesteaders, the terms of the Second Fort Laramie Treaty had been violated.": 1,

    " Those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end.": 1,
    " as removed as we the dominant society may feel.": 1,
    " From a massacre in 1890, or a series of broken treaties 150 years ago, I still have to ask you the question, how should you feel about the statistics of today?": 1,
    " What is the connection between these images of suffering and the history that I just read to you?": 1,
    " and how much of this history do you need to own even?": 1,
    "Is any of this your responsibility today?": 1,
    " I have been told that there must be something we can do.": 1,
    "There must be some call to action.": 1,
    " because for so long I've been standing on the sidelines, content to be a witness, just taking photographs.": 1,
    " because the solution seems so far in the past, I needed nothing short of a time machine to access them.": 1,
    " The suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix.": 1,
    "It's not something everyone can get behind, the way they get behind helping Haiti, or ending AIDS, or fighting a famine.": 1,
    " The fix, as it's called, may be much more difficult for the dominant society than say a $50 check, or a church trip to paint some graffitied covered houses, or a suburban family donating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore.": 1,
    " So where does that leave us?": 1,
