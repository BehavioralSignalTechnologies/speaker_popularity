    "I knew that.": 2,
    " On the 4th of January, 1934, a young man delivered a report to the United States Congress": 1,
    " that 80 years on still shapes the lives of everyone in this room today.": 1,
    "Still shapes the lives of everyone on this planet.": 1,
    " That young man wasn't a politician, he wasn't a businessman, a civil rights activist, or a faith leader.": 1,
    "He was that most unlikely of heroes, an economist.": 1,
    " His name was Simon Kuznets, and the report that he delivered was called National Income 1929-1932.": 1,
    "Now you might think this is a rather dry and dull report,": 1,
    " And you're absolutely right.": 1,
    "It's dry as a bone.": 1,
    " But this report is the foundation of how today we judge the success of countries, what we know best as gross domestic product, GDP.": 1,
    " GDP has defined and shaped our lives for the last 80 years.": 1,
    " And today, I want to talk about a different way to measure the success of countries, a different way to define and shape our lives for the next 80 years.": 1,
    " But first, we have to understand how GDP came to dominate our lives.": 1,
    " Kuznets report was delivered at a moment of crisis.": 1,
    "The US economy was plummeting into the Great Depression and policymakers were struggling to respond.": 1,
    " struggling because they didn't know what was going on.": 1,
    "They didn't have data and statistics.": 1,
    "So what Kuznets report gave them was reliable data on what the US economy was producing": 1,
    " updated year by year.": 1,
    "And armed with this information, policymakers were eventually able to find a way out of the slump.": 1,
    " And because Kuznets invention was found to be so useful, it spread around the world.": 1,
    "And now today, every country produces GDP statistics.": 1,
    " But in that first report, Kuznets himself delivered a warning.": 1,
    " It's in the introductory chapter, on page seven, he says, the welfare of a nation can therefore scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income as defined above.": 1,
    " It's not the greatest sound bite in the world, and it's dressed up in the cautious language of the economist.": 1,
    "But his message was clear.": 1,
    "GDP is a tool to help us measure economic performance.": 1,
    " It's not a measure of our well-being and it shouldn't be a guide to all decision-making.": 1,
    " But we have ignored Kuznet's warning.": 1,
    "We live in a world where GDP is the benchmark of success in a global economy.": 1,
    "Our politicians boast when GDP goes up.": 1,
    " markets move and trillions of dollars of capital move around the world based on which countries are going up and which countries are going down, all measured in GDP.": 1,
    " Our societies have become engines to create more GDP.": 1,
    " But we know that GDP is flawed.": 1,
    "It ignores the environment.": 1,
    "It counts bombs and prisons as progress.": 1,
    " It can't count happiness or community, and it has nothing to say about fairness or justice.": 1,
    " Is it any surprise that our world, marching to the drumbeat of GDP, is teetering on the brink of environmental disaster and filled with anger and conflict?": 1,
    " We need a better way to measure our societies.": 1,
    "A measure based on the real things that matter to real people.": 1,
    "Do I have enough to eat?": 1,
    "Can I read and write?": 1,
    "Am I safe?": 1,
    " Do I have rights?": 1,
    "Do I live in a society where I'm not discriminated against?": 1,
    "Is my future and the future of my children prevented from environmental destruction?": 1,
    " These are questions that GDP does not and cannot answer.": 1,
    " There have, of course, been efforts in the past to move beyond GDP.": 1,
    "But I believe that we are living in a moment when we are ready for a measurement revolution.": 1,
    " We're ready because we've seen in the financial crisis of 2008 how our fetish for economic growth led us so far astray.": 1,
    " We've seen in the Arab Spring how countries like Tunisia were supposedly economic superstars, but they were societies being full of seething with discontentment.": 1,
    " We're ready because today we have the technology to gather and analyze data in ways that would have been unimaginable to Kuznets.": 1,
    " Today I'd like to introduce you to the Social Progress Index.": 1,
    "It's a measure of the well-being of society completely separate from GDP.": 1,
    "It's a whole new way of looking at the world.": 1,
    " The Social Progress Index begins by defining what it means to be a good society, based around three dimensions.": 1,
    "The first is, does everyone have the basic needs for survival?": 1,
    "Food, water, shelter, safety.": 1,
    " Secondly, does everyone have access to the building blocks to improve their lives?": 1,
    "Education, information, health.": 1,
    " and sustainable environment?": 1,
    "And then third, does every individual have access to a chance to pursue their goals and dreams and ambitions free from obstacles?": 1,
    "Do they have rights?": 1,
    " freedom of choice, freedom from discrimination, and access to the world's most advanced knowledge.": 1,
    "Together, these 12 components form the social progress framework.": 1,
    " And for each of these 12 components, we have indicators to measure how countries are performing.": 1,
    "Not indicators of effort or intention, but real achievement.": 1,
    " We don't measure how much a country spends on health care.": 1,
    "We measure the length and quality of people's lives.": 1,
    " We don't measure whether governments pass laws against discrimination.": 1,
    "We measure whether people experience discrimination.": 1,
    " But what you want to know is who's top, don't you?": 1,
    " I knew that.": 1,
    "Okay, I'm going to show you.": 1,
    "I'm going to show you on this chart.": 1,
    "So here we are.": 1,
    "So what I've done here is put on the vertical axis social progress.": 1,
    "Higher is better.": 1,
    " And then just for comparison, just for fun, on the horizontal axis is GEP per capita.": 1,
    "Further to the right is more.": 1,
    " So the country in the world with the highest social progress, the number one country on social progress is": 1,
    " New Zealand.": 1,
    " Voila, never been, must go.": 1,
    " The country with the least social progress, I'm sorry to say, is Chad.": 1,
    "I've never been.": 1,
    "Maybe next year.": 1,
    " or maybe the year after.": 1,
    " Now, I know what you're thinking.": 1,
    "You're thinking, aha, but New Zealand has a higher GDP than Chad.": 1,
    "It's a good point, well made.": 1,
    " But let me show you two other countries.": 1,
    "Here's the United States, considerably richer than New Zealand, but with a lower level of social progress.": 1,
    " And then here's Senegal.": 1,
    "It's got a higher level of social progress than Chad at the same level of GDP.": 1,
    " So what's going on?": 1,
    "Well, look, let me bring in the rest of the countries of the world, the 132 we've been able to measure, each one represented by a dot.": 1,
    "There we go, lots of dots.": 1,
    " Now, obviously, I can't do all of them, so a few highlights for you.": 1,
    "The highest ranked G7 country is Canada.": 1,
    " My country, the United Kingdom, is sort of middling, sort of dull, but who cares?": 1,
    "At least we beat the French.": 1,
    " And then looking at the emerging economies, the bricks, top of the bricks, pleased to say, is Brazil.": 1,
    "Come on, cheer.": 1,
    "Go Brazil.": 1,
    " beating South Africa, then Russia, then China, and then India.": 1,
    "Tucked away on the right-hand side, you will see a dot of a country with a lot of GDP but not a huge amount of social progress.": 1,
    "That's Kuwait.": 1,
    " And just above Brazil is a social progress superpower.": 1,
    "That's Costa Rica.": 1,
    "Got a level of social progress the same as some Western European countries with a much lower GDP.": 1,
    " Now, my slide is getting a little cluttered, and I'd like to step back a bit.": 1,
    "So let me take away these countries and then pop in the regression line.": 1,
    "So this shows the average relationship between GDP and social progress.": 1,
    " And the first thing to notice is that there's lots of noise around the trend line.": 1,
    " And what this shows, what this empirically demonstrates, is that GDP is not destiny.": 1,
    "At every level of GDP per capita, there are opportunities for more social progress, risks of less.": 1,
    " The second thing to notice is that for poor countries, the curve is really steep.": 1,
    "So what this tells us is that if poor countries can get a little bit of extra GDP,": 1,
    " And if they reinvest that in doctors, nurses, water supply, sanitation, et cetera, there's a lot of social progress bang for your GDP buck.": 1,
    " And that's good news and that's what we've seen over the last 20, 30 years with a lot of people lifted out of poverty by economic growth and good policies in poorer countries.": 1,
    " But go on a bit further up the curve, and then we see it flattening out.": 1,
    "Each extra dollar of GDP is buying less and less social progress.": 1,
    " And with more and more of the world's population living on this part of the curve, it means GDP is becoming less and less useful as a guide to our development.": 1,
    " Let's show you an example of Brazil.": 1,
    "Here's Brazil.": 1,
    "Social progress of about 70 out of 100.": 1,
    "GDP per capita of about $14,000 a year.": 1,
    "And look, Brazil's above the line.": 1,
    " Brazil is doing a reasonably good job of turning GDP into social progress.": 1,
    " But where does Brazil go next?": 1,
    "Let's say that Brazil adopts a bold economic plan to double GDP in the next decade.": 1,
    "But that is only half a plan.": 1,
    "It's less than half a plan.": 1,
    " Because where does Brazil want to go on social progress?": 1,
    "Brazil, it's possible to increase your growth, increase your GDP, while stagnating or going backwards on social progress.": 1,
    " We don't want Brazil to become like Russia.": 1,
    "What you really want is for Brazil to get ever more efficient at creating social progress from its GDP so it becomes more like New Zealand.": 1,
    " And what that means is that Brazil needs to prioritize social progress in its development plan and see that it's not just growth alone, it's growth with social progress.": 1,
    " And that's what the Social Progress Index does.": 1,
    "It reframes the debate about development, not just about GDP alone, but inclusive, sustainable growth that brings real improvements in people's lives.": 1,
    " And it's not just about countries.": 1,
    "Earlier this year, with our friends from the Amazon nonprofit here in Brazil, we launched the first sub-national social progress index.": 1,
    " We did it for the Amazon region.": 1,
    "It's an area the size of Europe, 24 million people, one of the most deprived parts of the country.": 1,
    " And here are the results.": 1,
    "And this is broken down into nearly 800 different municipalities.": 1,
    " And with this detailed information about the real quality of life in this part of the country, Amazon and other partners from government, business and civil society,": 1,
    " can work together to construct a development plan that will help really improve people's lives while protecting that precious global asset that is the Amazon rainforest.": 1,
    " And this is just the beginning.": 1,
    "You can create a social progress index for any state, region, city, or municipality.": 1,
    " We all know and love TEDx.": 1,
    "This is Social Progress X. This is a tool for anyone to come and use.": 1,
    " Contrary to the way we sometimes talk about it, GDP was not handed down from God on tablets of stone.": 1,
    " It's a measurement tool invented in the 20th century to address the challenges of the 20th century.": 1,
    " In the 21st century, we face new challenges, aging, obesity, climate change, and so on.": 1,
    "To face those challenges, we need new tools of measurement, new ways of valuing progress.": 1,
    " Imagine if we could measure what nonprofits, charities, volunteers, civil society organizations really contribute to our society.": 1,
    " Imagine if businesses competed not just on the basis of their economic contribution, but on their contribution to social progress.": 1,
    " Imagine if we could hold politicians to account for really improving people's lives.": 1,
    " Imagine if we could work together, government, business, civil society, me, you, and make this century the century of social progress.": 1,
