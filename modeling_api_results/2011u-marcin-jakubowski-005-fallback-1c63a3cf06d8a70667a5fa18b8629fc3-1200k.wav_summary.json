    " Hi, my name is Marcin, farmer, technologist.": 1,
    "I was born in Poland, now in the US.": 1,
    " I started a group called Open Source Ecology.": 1,
    "We've identified the 50 most important machines that we think takes for modern life to exist.": 1,
    " things from tractors, bread ovens, circuit makers.": 1,
    "Then we set out to create an open source DIY do-it-yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost.": 1,
    "We call this the global village construction set.": 1,
    " So let me tell you a story.": 1,
    "So I finished my 20s with a PhD in fusion energy and I discovered": 1,
    " I was useless.": 1,
    "I had no practical skills.": 1,
    "I mean, the world presented me with options and I took them.": 1,
    "I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle.": 1,
    " So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming.": 1,
    "I bought a tractor, then it broke.": 1,
    "I paid to get it repaired, then it broke again.": 1,
    "And pretty soon,": 1,
    " I was broke too.": 1,
    " I realized that the truly appropriate low-cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn't exist yet.": 1,
    " I needed tools that were robust, modular, highly efficient and optimized, low cost, made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime, not designed for obsolescence.": 1,
    "I found that I would have to build them myself.": 1,
    " So I did just that.": 1,
    " And I tested them.": 1,
    " and I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale.": 1,
    " So then I published the 3D designs, schematics, instructional videos, and budgets on a wiki.": 1,
    " Then contributors from all over the world began showing up prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits.": 1,
    "So far we have prototyped 8 of the 50 machines and now the project is beginning to grow on its own.": 1,
    " We know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity and the same is starting to happen with hardware too.": 1,
    "We're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people's lives in such tangible material ways.": 1,
    " If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing, then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential.": 1,
    "That's not only in the developing world.": 1,
    " Our tools are being made for the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker.": 1,
    "We've seen lots of excitement from these people who can now start a construction business, parts manufacturing, organic CSA, or just selling power back to the grid.": 1,
    " Our goal is a repository of published design so clear, so complete that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit.": 1,
    " I've planted a hundred trees in a day.": 1,
    " I've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet": 1,
    " and built a tractor in six days.": 1,
    "From what I've seen, this is only the beginning.": 1,
    "If this idea is truly sound, then the implications are significant.": 1,
    " a greater distribution of the means of production, environmentally sound supply chains, and a newly relevant DIY maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity.": 1,
    " We're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
