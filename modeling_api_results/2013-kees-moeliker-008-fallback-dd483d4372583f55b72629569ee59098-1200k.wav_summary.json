    " This is the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam where I work as a curator.": 1,
    "It's my job to make sure the collection stays okay and that it grows.": 1,
    "And basically it means I collect dead animals.": 1,
    " Back in 1995, we got a new wing next to the museum.": 1,
    "It was made of glass.": 1,
    " And this building really helped me to do my job good.": 1,
    "The building was a true bird killer.": 1,
    " You may know that birds don't understand the concept of class.": 1,
    "They don't see it.": 1,
    "So they fly into the windows and get killed.": 1,
    "The only thing I had to do is go out, pick them up, and have them stuffed for the collection.": 1,
    " And in those days, I developed an ear to identify birds just by the sound of the bangs they made against the class.": 1,
    " And it was on June 5th, 1995 that I heard a loud bang against the glass that changed my life and ended that of a duck.": 1,
    " And this is what I saw when I looked out of the window.": 1,
    " This is the dead duck that flew against the window.": 1,
    "It's laying dead on its belly.": 1,
    "But next to the dead duck is a live duck.": 1,
    " And please pay attention, both are of the male sex.": 1,
    " And then this happened.": 1,
    "The live duck mounted the dead duck and started to copulate.": 1,
    " Well, I'm a biologist, I'm an ornithologist.": 1,
    "I said, something's wrong here.": 1,
    "One is dead, one is alive.": 1,
    "That must be necrophilia.": 1,
    " And look, both are of the male sex.": 1,
    "Homosexual necrophilia.": 1,
    " So I...": 1,
    " I took my camera, took my notebook, took a chair and started to observe this behavior.": 1,
    " After 75 minutes...": 1,
    " Pfft": 1,
    " I had seen enough and I got hungry.": 1,
    " And I wanted to go home.": 1,
    "So I went out, collected the duck, and before I put it in the freezer, I checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex.": 1,
    " And here's a rare picture of a duck's penis.": 1,
    "So it was indeed of the male sex.": 1,
    "It's a rare picture because there are 10,000 species of birds and only 300 possess a penis.": 1,
    " I knew I'd seen something special, but it took me six years to decide to publish it.": 1,
    " I mean, it's a nice topic for a birthday party or at the coffee machine.": 1,
    " But to share this among your peers is something different.": 1,
    "I didn't have the framework.": 1,
    "So after six years, my friends and colleagues urged me to publish.": 1,
    "So I published the first case of homosexual necrophilia in the Mallard.": 1,
    " And here's the situation again.": 1,
    "A is my office.": 1,
    "B is the place where the duck hit the clouds and C is from where I watched it.": 1,
    " And here are the ducks again.": 1,
    " As you probably know in science, when you write a kind of special paper only six or seven people read it.": 1,
    " Um...": 1,
    " But then something good happened.": 1,
    "I got a phone call from a person called Mark Abrahams.": 1,
    "And he told me, you won a prize with your duck paper.": 1,
    "The Ig Nobel Prize.": 1,
    " and the Ignowell Prize.": 1,
    " The Ig Nobel Prize honors research that first make people laugh and then make them think, with the ultimate goal to make more people interested in science.": 1,
    " That's a good thing, so I accepted the price.": 1,
    " I went, let me remind you that Mark Abrams didn't call me from Stockholm, he called me from Cambridge, Massachusetts.": 1,
    "So I traveled to Boston, to Cambridge.": 1,
    " and I went to this wonderful Iknobol Prize ceremony held at Harvard University.": 1,
    "And this ceremony is a very nice experience.": 1,
    " Real Nobel laureates hand you the prize.": 1,
    "That's the first thing.": 1,
    "And there are nine other winners who will get prizes.": 1,
    "Here's one of my fellow winners.": 1,
    "That's Charles Paxton.": 1,
    " who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper, courtship behavior of ostriches towards humans under farming conditions in Britain.": 1,
    " And I think there's one or two more ignoble prize winners in this room.": 1,
    "Dan, where are you, Dan Ariely?": 1,
    " Applause for Dan.": 1,
    " Then one is priced in medicine for demonstrating that high-priced fake medicine works better than low-priced fake medicine.": 1,
    " So here's my one minute of fame.": 1,
    " My acceptance speech.": 1,
    " And here's the duck.": 1,
    "This is its first time on the US West Coast.": 1,
    "I'm going to pass it around.": 1,
    " Yeah?": 1,
    "You can pass it around.": 1,
    "Please note, it's a museum specimen, but there's no chance you get the avian flu.": 1,
    " After winning this prize, my life changed.": 1,
    "In the first place, people started to send me all kinds of duck related things.": 1,
    " And I got a real nice collection.": 1,
    " More importantly...": 1,
    " Okay.": 1,
    "More importantly, people started to send me their observations of remarkable animal behavior.": 1,
    "And believe me, if there's an animal misbehaving on this planet, I know about it.": 1,
    " This is a moose.": 1,
    "It's a moose trying to copulate with a bronze statue of a bison.": 1,
    "This is in Montana, 2008.": 1,
    " This is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish.": 1,
    "This is the Netherlands, 2011.": 1,
    " These are cane toads in Australia.": 1,
    "This is a roadkill.": 1,
    "Please note that this is necrophilia.": 1,
    "It's remarkable.": 1,
    "But the position, the missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom.": 1,
    " These are pigeons in Rotterdam.": 1,
    " Barn Swallows in Hong Kong, 2004.": 1,
    " This is a turkey in Wisconsin on the premise of the Ethan Allen Juvenile Correctional Institution.": 1,
    " It took all day.": 1,
    " and the prisoners had a great time.": 1,
    " So what does this mean?": 1,
    "I mean, the question I ask myself, why does this happen in nature?": 1,
    "Well, what I concluded from...": 1,
    " reviewing all these cases is that it is important that this happens only when death is instant": 1,
    " and in a dramatic way and in the right position of a copulation.": 1,
    "At least I thought it was till I got these slides.": 1,
    " And here you see a dead duck.": 1,
    "It's been there for three days, and it's laying on its back.": 1,
    "So there goes my theory of necrophilia.": 1,
    " Another example of the impact of glass buildings on the life of birds is Mad Max.": 1,
    "A black bird lives in Rotterdam.": 1,
    " The only thing this bird did was fly against this window from 2004 to 2008, day in, day out.": 1,
    "Here he goes.": 1,
    "And here's a short video.": 1,
    " I will always be here": 1,
    " You.": 1,
    " So what this bird does is fighting its own image.": 1,
    " He sees an intruder in his territory, and it's coming all the time he's there.": 1,
    "So there's no end to it.": 1,
    " And I thought in the beginning, I studied this bird for a couple of years that, well, shouldn't the brain of this bird be damaged?": 1,
    "It's not.": 1,
    "I show you here some slides, some frames from the video.": 1,
    " And at the last moment before he hits the glass, he puts his feet in front and then he bangs against the glass.": 1,
    " So I'll conclude to invite you all to that Duck Day.": 1,
    "That's on June 5th every year at 5 minutes to 6 in the afternoon.": 1,
    "We come together at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam.": 1,
    " The duck comes out of the museum and we try to discuss new ways to prevent birds from colliding with windows.": 1,
    " And as you know, or as you may not know, this is one of the major causes of death for birds in the world.": 1,
    "In the US alone, a billion birds die in collision with glass buildings.": 1,
    " And when it's over we go to a Chinese restaurant.": 1,
    " And we have a six course duck dinner.": 1,
    " So I hope to see you.": 1,
    " next year in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for Dad Duck Day.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    " Oh, sorry.": 1,
    " May I have my duck back, please?": 1
