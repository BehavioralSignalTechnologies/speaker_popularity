    " Ever since then, I was fascinated by this incredible language.": 1,
    " But to an outsider, it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China.": 1,

    "He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the well.": 1,
    " One tree is a tree, two trees together we have the woods, three trees together we create the forest.": 1,
    " Put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation.": 1,
    "Put a mouse on the top of the tree, let's eat it.": 1,
    " Easy to remember, since the talking tree is pretty idiotic.": 1,
    " Remember fire?": 1,
    "Two fires together, I get really hot.": 1,

    " Three women together, be careful, it's adultery.": 1,
    " So we have gone through almost 30 characters.": 1,
    "By using this method, the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32.": 1,
    "The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32.": 1,
    " So within very little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old.": 1,
