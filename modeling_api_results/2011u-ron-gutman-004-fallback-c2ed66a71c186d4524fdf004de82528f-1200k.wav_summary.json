    " When I was a child, I always wanted to be a superhero.": 1,
    "I wanted to save the world and make everyone happy.": 1,
    "But I knew that I'd need superpowers to make my dreams come true.": 1,
    " So I used to embark on these imaginary journeys to find intergalactic objects from planet Krypton, which was a lot of fun, but didn't yield much result.": 1,
    " When I grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers, I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science to find a more useful truth.": 1,
    " I started my journey in California with a UC Berkeley 30-year longitudinal study that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook": 1,
    " and try to measure their success and well-being throughout their life.": 1,
    "By measuring their student smiles, researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long-lasting a subject marriage will be.": 1,
    " how well she would score in standardized tests of well-being, and how inspiring she would be to others.": 1,
    " In another yearbook, I stumbled upon Barry Obama's picture.": 1,
    "When I first saw his picture, I thought that his superpowers came from his super color.": 1,
    " But now I know it was all in his smile.": 1,
    "Another aha moment came from a 2010 Wayne State University research project that looked into pre-1950s baseball cards of major league players.": 1,
    " The researchers found that the span of a player's smile could actually predict the span of his life.": 1,
    "Players who didn't smile in their pictures lived an average of only 72.9 years, whereas players with beaming smile": 1,
    " lived an average of almost 80 years.": 1,
    " The good news is that we're actually born smiling.": 1,
    "Using 3D ultrasound technology, we can now see that developing babies appear to smile even in the womb.": 1,
    " When they're born, babies continue to smile, initially mostly in their sleep, and even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice.": 1,
    " Smiling is one of the most basic biologically uniform expressions of all humans.": 1,
    "In studies conducted in Papua New Guinea, Paul Ekman, the world's most renowned researcher on facial expression found that even members of the Fori tribe": 1,
    " who were completely disconnected from Western culture and also known for their unusual cannibalism rituals, attributed smiles to descriptions of situations the same way you and I would.": 1,
    "So from Papua New Guinea,": 1,
    " to Hollywood, all the way to modern art in Beijing, we smile often and use smile to express joy and satisfaction.": 1,
    " How many people here in this room smile more than 20 times per day?": 1,
    "Raise your hand if you do.": 1,
    " Oh, wow.": 1,
    "Outside of this room, more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day, whereas less than 14% of us smile less than five.": 1,
    " In fact, those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children who smile as many as 400 times per day.": 1,
    " Have you ever wondered why being around children who smile so frequently makes you smile very often?": 1,
    " A recent study at Uppsala University in Sweden found that it's very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles.": 1,
    "You ask why?": 1,
    " because smiling is evolutionary contagious and it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles.": 1,
    " Mimicking a smile and experiencing it physically help us understand whether a smile is fake or real so we can understand the emotional state of the smiler.": 1,
    " In a recent mimicking study at the University of Clermont-Ferrand in France, subjects were asked to determine whether a smile was real or fake while holding a pencil in their mouth to repress smiling muscles.": 1,
    " Without the pencil, subjects were excellent judges, but with the pencil in their mouth, when they could not mimic the smile they saw, their judgment was impaired.": 1,
    " In addition to theorizing on evolution in the origin of species, Charles Darwin also wrote the facial feedback response theory.": 1,
    " His theory states that the act of smiling itself actually makes us feel better, rather than smiling being merely a result of feeling good.": 1,
    " In his study, Darwin actually cited a French neurologist, Julien Boucham, who used electric jolts to facial muscles to induce and stimulate smiles.": 1,
    "Please, don't try this at home.": 1,
    " In a related German study, researchers used fMRI imaging to measure brain activity before and after injecting Botox to suppress smiling muscles.": 1,
    " The findings supported Darwin's theory by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain in a way that helps us feel better when we smile.": 1,
    " Smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate, a well-regarded pleasure inducer, cannot match.": 1,
    " British researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate.": 1,
    " Wait, the same study found that smiling is as stimulating as receiving up to 16,000 pounds sterling in cash.": 1,
    " That's like 25 grand a smile.": 1,
    "It's not bad.": 1,
    "And think about it this way, 25,000 times 400, quite a few kids out there feel like Mark Zuckerberg every day.": 1,
    " And unlike lots of chocolate, lots of smiling can actually make you healthier.": 1,
    "Smiling can help reduce the level of stress enhancing hormones like cortisol, adrenaline, and dopamine,": 1,
    " increase the level of mood enhancing hormones like endorphin, and reduce overall blood pressure.": 1,
    "And if that's not enough, smiling can actually make you look good in the eyes of others.": 1,
    " A recent study at Penn State University found that when you smile, you don't only appear to be more likable and courteous, but you actually appear to be more competent.": 1,
    " So whenever you want to look great and competent, reduce your stress, or improve your marriage, or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high-quality chocolate without incurring the calorie cost, or as if you found 25 grand in a pocket of an old jacket,": 1,
    " you hadn't worn for ages.": 1,
    "Or whenever you want to tap into a superpower that will help you and everyone around you live a longer, healthier, happier life, smile.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
