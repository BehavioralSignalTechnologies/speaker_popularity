    "Please welcome Claren McVadden.": 1,
    " The human voice.": 1,
    " mysterious, spontaneous, primal.": 1,
    " For me, the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel, except perhaps jealousy.": 1,
    " And the breath, the breath is the captain of that vessel.": 1,
    " A child is born.": 1,
    " Takes its first breath.": 1,
    " and we behold the wondrous beauty": 1,
    " A vocal expression.": 1,
    "Mysterious, spontaneous.": 1,
    " and primal.": 1,
    " A few years ago I did a meditation retreat in Thailand.": 1,
    "I wanted a place that I would have total silence and total solitude.": 1,
    " I spent two weeks at this retreat in my own little hut.": 1,
    "No music, no nothing, sounds of nature.": 1,
    " trying to find the essence of concentration, being in the moment.": 1,
    " On my last day, the woman who'd looked after the place": 1,
    " She came and we spoke for a minute and then she said to me,": 1,
    " Would you sing something for me?": 1,
    "And I thought, but this is a place of total quiet and silence.": 1,
    "I can't make noise.": 1,
    " She said, please sing for me.": 1,
    " So I closed my eyes.": 1,
    "I took breath.": 1,
    " And the first thing that came up and out was summertime.": 1,
    " Porgy and Bess.": 1,
    " Fish are jumping and the cotton is high.": 1,
    "Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good looking.": 1,
    "So hush little baby, don't you cry.": 1,
    " And I opened my eyes and I saw that she had her eyes closed.": 1,
    "And after a moment she opened her eyes and she looked at me and she said,": 1,
    " It's like meditation.": 1,
    " And in that moment I understood that everything I had gone to Thailand to look for, to search for, I had it already in my singing.": 1,
    " the calm, but alertness, the focus, but awareness, and being totally in the moment.": 1,
    " When you're totally in the moment, when I'm totally in the moment, the vessel of expression is open.": 1,
    "The emotions can flow from me to you and back.": 1,
    " It's extremely profound experience.": 1,
    " There's a piece by a composer, an American composer called John Cage.": 1,
    "It's called Aria.": 1,
    "It was written for an amazing singer called Kathy Barbarian.": 1,
    "And the thing about this piece, it's so special,": 1,
    " Do you see it behind me?": 1,
    " It's not notated in any way.": 1,
    " no notes, no flats, no sharps, but it's a kind of structure.": 1,
    "And the singer within this structure has total freedom to be creative, spontaneous.": 1,
    "For example,": 1,
    " There are different colors, and each color gets a different type of singing.": 1,
    "Pop, country and western, opera, jazz.": 1,
    "And you just have to be consistent with that color.": 1,
    " You see there are different lines.": 1,
    "You choose in your own tempo, in your own way to follow the line, but you must respect it.": 1,
    " more or less, and these little dots, these represent a sort of sound.": 1,
    " That's not a vocal, not a lyrical way of expressing the voice.": 1,
    "Using the body, it could be sneezing, it could be coughing, it could be animals, exactly.": 1,
    "Clapping, whatever.": 1,
    " And there's different text.": 1,
    "There's Armenian, Russian, French, English, Italian.": 1,
    "So within this structure, one is free.": 1,
    "To me, this piece is an ode to the voice.": 1,
    " Because it's mysterious, as we can see.": 1,
    " It's quite spontaneous.": 1,
    " And it's primal.": 1,
    "So I would like to share this piece with you.": 1,
    "It's Aria of John Cage.": 1,
    " Turn part, zoom.": 1,
    " Woof!": 1,
