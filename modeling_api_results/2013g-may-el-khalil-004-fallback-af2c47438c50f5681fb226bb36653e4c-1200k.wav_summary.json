    " I come from Lebanon and I believe that running can change the world.": 1,
    "I know what I have just said is simply not obvious.": 1,
    " You know Lebanon as a country has been once destroyed by a long and bloody civil war.": 1,
    "Honestly, I don't know why they call it civil war when there is nothing civil about it.": 1,
    " Syria to the north, Israel and Palestine to the south, and our government even up till this moment is still fragmented and unstable.": 1,
    " For years, the country has been divided between politics and religion.": 1,
    " However, for one day a year, we truly stand united.": 1,
    "And that's when the marathon takes place.": 1,
    " I used to be a marathon runner.": 1,
    "Long distance running was not only good for my well-being,": 1,
    " But it helped me meditate and dream big.": 1,
    "So the longer distances I ran, the bigger my dreams became.": 1,
    "Until one fateful morning, and while training,": 1,
    " I was hit by a bus.": 1,
    " I nearly died, was in coma, stayed at the hospital for two years, and underwent 36 surgeries to be able to walk again.": 1,
    " As soon as I came out of my coma, I realized that I was no longer the same runner I used to be.": 1,
    "So I decided, if I couldn't run myself, I wanted to make sure.": 1,
    " that others could.": 1,
    "So out of my hospital bed, I asked my husband to start taking notes, and a few months later, the marathon was born.": 1,
    " Organizing a marathon as a reaction to an accident may sound strange.": 1,
    " But at that time, even during my most vulnerable condition, I needed to dream big.": 1,
    "I needed something to take me out of my pain and objective to look forward to.": 1,
    " I didn't want to pity myself, nor to be pitied.": 1,
    "And I thought by organizing such a marathon, I'll be able to pay back to my community, build bridges with the outside world,": 1,
    " and invite runners to come to Lebanon and run under the umbrella of peace.": 1,
    " Organizing a marathon in Lebanon is definitely not like organizing one in New York.": 1,
    " How do you introduce the concept of running to a nation that is constantly at the brink of war?": 1,
    "How do you ask those who were once fighting and killing each other": 1,
    " to come together and run next to each other.": 1,
    " More than that, how do you convince people to run a distance of 26.2 miles at a time they were not even familiar with the word marathon?": 1,
    " So we had to start from scratch.": 1,
    "For almost two years, we went all over the country and even visited remote villages.": 1,
    " I personally met with people from all walks of life, mayors, NGOs, school children, politicians, militiamen.": 1,

    " In October 2003, over 6,000 runners from 49 different nationalities came to the start line all determined.": 1,
    "And when the gunfire went off, this time,": 1,
    " It was a signal to run in harmony for a change.": 1,
    " The marathon grew, so did our political problems.": 1,
    "But for every disaster we had, the marathon found ways to bring people together.": 1,
    " In 2005, our prime minister was assassinated and the country came to a complete standstill.": 1,
    " So we organized a five kilometer United We Run campaign.": 1,
    "Over 60,000 people came to the start line all wearing white t-shirts with no political slogans.": 1,
    " That was a turning point for the marathon where people started looking at it as a platform for peace and unity.": 1,
    " Between 2006 up to 2009, our country Lebanon went through unstable years.": 1,
    " invasions and more assassinations that brought us close to a civil war.": 1,
    "The country was divided again so much that our parliament resigned.": 1,
    "We had no president for a year.": 1,
    " and no prime minister, but we did have a marathon.": 1,
    " So through the marathon, we learned that political problems can be overcome.": 1,
    "When the opposition party decided to shut down part of the city center, we negotiated alternative routes.": 1,
    " Government protesters became sideline cheerleaders.": 1,
    "They even hosted juice stations.": 1,
    " You know, the marathon has really become one of its kind.": 1,
    "It gained credibility from both the Lebanese and the international": 1,
    " community.": 1,
    "Last November 2012, over 33,000 runners from 85 different nationalities came to the start line, but this time they challenged a very stormy and rainy weather.": 1,
    " The streets were flooded, but people didn't want to miss on the opportunity of being part of such a national day.": 1,
    " BMA has expanded.": 1,
    "We include everyone, the young, the elderly, the disabled, the mentally challenged, the blind, the elite, the amateur runners, even moms with their babies.": 1,
    " Themes have included runs for the environment, breast cancer, for the love of Lebanon, for peace, or just simply to run.": 1,
    " the first annual all-women's and girls' race for empowerment, which is one of its kind in the region.": 1,
    " has just taken place only a few weeks ago with 4,512 women, including the First Lady.": 1,

    " to help them structure a similar sporting event.": 1,
    " We are now one of the largest running events in the Middle East, but most importantly, it is a platform for hope and cooperation in an ever fragile": 1,
    " and unstable part of the world.": 1,
    " From Boston to Beirut, we stand as one.": 1,
