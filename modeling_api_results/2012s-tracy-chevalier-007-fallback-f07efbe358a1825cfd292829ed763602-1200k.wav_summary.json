    " I'm going to tell you about an affliction I suffer from.": 1,
    "And I have a funny feeling that quite a few of you suffer from it as well.": 1,
    " When I'm walking around an art gallery, rooms and rooms full of paintings, after about 15 or 20 minutes,": 1,
    " I realize I'm not thinking about the paintings.": 1,
    "I'm not connecting to them.": 1,
    "Instead, I'm thinking about that cup of coffee I desperately need to wake me up.": 1,
    "I'm suffering from gallery fatigue.": 1,
    " How many of you out there suffer from it?": 1,
    "Sometimes you might last longer than 20 minutes or even shorter, but I think we all suffer from it.": 1,
    "And do you have the accompanying guilt?": 1,
    " For me, I look at the paintings on the wall and I think somebody has decided to put them there, thinks they're good enough to be on that wall, but I don't always see it.": 1,
    "In fact, most of the time I don't see it.": 1,
    " And I leave feeling actually unhappy.": 1,
    "I feel guilty and unhappy with myself.": 1,
    "Rather than thinking there's something wrong with the painting, I think there's something wrong with me.": 1,
    "And that's not a good experience to leave a gallery like that.": 1,
    " The thing is, I think we should give ourselves a break.": 1,
    "If you think about going into a restaurant,": 1,
    " When you look at the menu, are you expected to order every single thing on the menu?": 1,
    "No.": 1,
    "You select.": 1,
    "If you go into a department store to buy a shirt,": 1,
    " Are you going to try on every single shirt and want every single shirt?": 1,
    "Of course not.": 1,
    "You can be selective.": 1,
    "It's expected.": 1,
    "How come then it's not so expected to be selective when we go to an art gallery?": 1,
    " Why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting?": 1,
    "Well, I'm trying to take a different approach, and there's two things I do.": 1,
    "When I go into a gallery, first of all, I go quite fast, and I look at everything": 1,
    " And I pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other.": 1,
    "I don't even know why they make me slow down, but something pulls me like a magnet.": 1,
    " And then I ignore all the others and I just go to that painting.": 1,
    "So it's the first thing I do is I do my own curation.": 1,
    "I choose a painting.": 1,
    "It might just be one painting in 50.": 1,
    "And then the second thing I do is I stand in front of that painting.": 1,
    " and I tell myself a story about it.": 1,
    "Why a story?": 1,
    "Well, I think that we are wired, our DNA,": 1,
    " tells us to tell stories.": 1,
    "We tell stories all the time about everything and I think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy": 1,
    " chaotic place, and sometimes stories were trying to make sense of the world a little bit, trying to bring some order to it.": 1,
    "Why not apply that to our looking at paintings?": 1,
    " So I now have this sort of restaurant menu visiting of art galleries.": 1,
    " There are three paintings I'm going to show you now that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks and want to tell stories about them.": 1,
    " The first one needs little introduction.": 1,
    "Girl with a Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer, 17th century Dutch painter.": 1,
    " This is the most glorious painting.": 1,
    "I first saw it when I was 19, and I immediately went out and got a poster of it.": 1,
    "And in fact, I still have that poster 30 years later, it's hanging in my house.": 1,
    " It's accompanied me everywhere I've gone.": 1,
    "I never tire of looking at her.": 1,
    "What made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with were just the gorgeous colors he uses and the light falling on her face.": 1,
    " But I think what's kept me still coming back year after year is another thing, and that is the look on her face, the conflicted look on her face.": 1,
    "I can't tell if she's happy or sad, and I change my mind all the time.": 1,
    " So that keeps me coming back.": 1,
    " One day, 16 years after I had this poster on my wall, I lay in bed and looked at her, and I suddenly thought, I wonder what the painter did to her to make her look like that.": 1,
    " And it was the first time I'd ever thought that the expression on her face is actually reflecting how she feels about him.": 1,
    "Always before, I thought of it as a portrait of a girl.": 1,
    " Now I began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship.": 1,
    "And I thought, well, what is that relationship?": 1,
    "So I went to find out.": 1,
    "I did some research and discovered we have no idea who she is.": 1,
    " In fact, we don't know who any of the models and any of Vermeer's paintings are, and we know very little about Vermeer himself, which made me go, yippee!": 1,
    "I can do whatever I want.": 1,
    "I can come up with whatever story I want to.": 1,
    " So here's how I came up with this story.": 1,
    "First of all, I thought, I've got to get her into the house.": 1,
    "How does Vermeer know her?": 1,
    "Well, there have been suggestions that she is his 12-year-old daughter.": 1,
    " The daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting.": 1,
    "And I thought, no, it's a very intimate look, but it's not a look a daughter gives her father.": 1,
    "For one thing, in Dutch painting of the time, if a woman's mouth is open, it was indicating sexual availability.": 1,
    " It would have been inappropriate for Vermeer to paint his daughter like that.": 1,
    "So it's not his daughter, but it's somebody close to him, physically close to him.": 1,
    "Well, who else would be in the house?": 1,
    " A servant.": 1,
    "A lovely servant.": 1,
    "So, she's in the house.": 1,
    "How do we get her into the studio?": 1,
    " We don't know very much about Vermeer, but the little bits that we do know, one thing we know is that he married a Catholic woman, they lived with her mother in a house where he had his own room, his studio.": 1,
    " He also had 11 children.": 1,
    "It would have been a chaotic, noisy household.": 1,
    "And if you've seen Vermeer's paintings before, you know that they're incredibly calm.": 1,
    " and quiet.": 1,
    "How does a painter paint such calm, quiet paintings with 11 kids around?": 1,
    "Well, he compartmentalizes his life.": 1,
    "He gets to the studio and he says, nobody comes in here.": 1,
    " not the wife, not the kids, okay, the maid can come in and clean.": 1,
    " She's in the studio.": 1,
    "He's got her in the studio, they're together, and he decides to paint her.": 1,
    " He has her wear very plain clothes.": 1,
    "Now all of the women, or most of the women in Vermeer's other paintings, wore velvet, silk,": 1,
    " for very sumptuous materials.": 1,
    "This is very plain.": 1,
    "The only thing that isn't plain is her pearl earring.": 1,
    " Now, if she's a servant, there is no way she could afford a pair of pearl earrings.": 1,
    "So those are not her pearl earrings.": 1,
    "Whose are they?": 1,
    " We happen to know there's a list of Katerina, the wife's clothes, amongst them a yellow coat with white fur, a yellow and black bodice, and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings": 1,
    " different women in the paintings, Vermeer's paintings.": 1,
    "So clearly her clothes were lent to various different women.": 1,
    "It's not such a leap of faith to take that that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife.": 1,
    " So we've got all the elements for our story.": 1,
    "She's in the studio with him for a long time.": 1,
    "These paintings took a long time to make.": 1,
    "They would have spent them time alone, all that time.": 1,
    " She's wearing his wife's pearl earring.": 1,
    "She's gorgeous.": 1,
    "She obviously loves him.": 1,
    "She's conflicted.": 1,
    "And does the wife know?": 1,
    "Maybe not.": 1,
    "And if she doesn't, well.": 1,
    " That's the story.": 1,
    " The next painting I'm going to talk about is called Boy Building a House of Cards by Chardin.": 1,
    " He's an 18th century French painter best known for his still lifes, but he did occasionally paint people.": 1,
    "And in fact, he painted four versions of this painting, different boys building houses of cards, all concentrated.": 1,
    " I like this version the best because some of the boys are older and some are younger.": 1,
    "And to me, this one, like Oldie Locks' porridge, is just right.": 1,
    " He's not quite a child and he's not quite a man.": 1,
    "He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience.": 1,
    "And that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.": 1,
    " And I looked at his face.": 1,
    "It's like a Vermeer painting a bit.": 1,
    "The light comes in from the left.": 1,
    "His face is bathed in this glowing light.": 1,
    "It's right in the center of the painting.": 1,
    "And you look at it, and I found that when I was looking at it, I was standing there going,": 1,
    " Look at me.": 1,
    "Please look at me.\"": 1,
    "And he didn't look at me.": 1,
    "He was still looking at his cards, and that's one of the seductive elements of this painting, is he's so focused on what he's doing that he doesn't look at us.": 1,
    " And that is, to me, the sign of a masterpiece, of a painting when there's a lack of resolution.": 1,
    "He's never going to look at me.": 1,
    " So I was thinking of a story where if I'm in this position, who could be there looking at him?": 1,
    "Not the painter.": 1,
    "I don't want to think about the painter.": 1,
    "I'm thinking of an older version of himself.": 1,
    " He's a man, a servant, an older servant looking at this younger servant saying, look at me.": 1,
    "I want to warn you about what you're about to go through.": 1,
    "Please look at me.": 1,
    "And he never does.": 1,
    " And that lack of resolution, the lack of resolution in Girl with a Pearl Earring, we don't know if she's happy or sad.": 1,
    "I've written an entire novel about her and I still don't know if she's happy or sad.": 1,
    " Again and again, back to the painting, looking for the answer, looking for the story to fill in that gap.": 1,
    "And we may make a story, and it satisfies us momentarily, but not really, and we come back again and again.": 1,
    " The last painting I'm going to talk about is called Anonymous by Anonymous.": 1,
    " This is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery.": 1,
    "They thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury.": 1,
    "And then they discovered that it wasn't him and they have no idea who it is.": 1,
    " Now, in the National Portrait Gallery, if you don't know the biography of the painting, it's kind of useless to you.": 1,
    "They can't hang it on the wall because they don't know who he is.": 1,
    "So, unfortunately, this orphan": 1,
    " spends most of his time in storage along with quite a number of other orphans, some of them some beautiful paintings.": 1,
    "This painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons.": 1,
    " One is the disconnection between his mouth that's smiling and his eyes that are wistful.": 1,
    "He's not happy, and why isn't he happy?": 1,
    " The second thing that really attracted me were his bright red cheeks.": 1,
    "He is blushing.": 1,
    "He's blushing for his portrait being made.": 1,
    "This must be a guy who blushes all the time.": 1,
    "What is he thinking about that's making him blush?": 1,
    " The third thing that made me stop in my tracks is his absolutely gorgeous doublet.": 1,
    " gray, those beautiful buttons, and you know what it makes me think of is it's sort of snug and puffy.": 1,
    "It's like a duvet spread over a bed.": 1,
    " I kept thinking of beds and red cheeks and of course I kept thinking of sex when I looked at him.": 1,
    "And I thought, is that what he's thinking about?": 1,
    " And I thought, if I'm going to make a story, what's the last thing I'm going to put in there?": 1,
    "Well, what would a Tudor gentleman be preoccupied with?": 1,
    "And I thought, well, Henry VIII, okay.": 1,
    " He'd be preoccupied with his inheritance, with his heir.": 1,
    "Who is going to inherit his name and his fortune?": 1,
    "You put all those together and you've got your story to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back.": 1,
    " Now, here's the story.": 1,
    " It's short.": 1,
    " Rosie.": 1,
    " I am still wearing the white brocade doublet Caroline gave me.": 1,
    "It has a plain high collar, detachable sleeves, and intricate buttons of twisted silk thread set close together so that the fit is snug.": 1,
    " The doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed.": 1,
    "Perhaps that was the intention.": 1,
    " I first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor.": 1,
    "I knew even before I stood up to speak that my cheeks were inflamed.": 1,
    " I have always flushed easily, from physical exertion, from wine, from high emotion.": 1,
    "As a boy, I was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys, but not by George.": 1,
    " Only George could call me Rosie.": 1,
    "I would not allow anyone else.": 1,
    "He managed to make the word tender.": 1,
    " When I made the announcement, George did not turn rosy, but went pale as my doublet.": 1,
    "He should not have been surprised.": 1,
    "It has been a common assumption that I would one day marry his cousin.": 1,
    " But it is difficult to hear the words aloud.": 1,
    "I know.": 1,
    "I could barely utter them.": 1,
    " Afterwards, I found George on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden.": 1,
    "Despite drinking steadily all afternoon, he was still pale.": 1,
    "We stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces.": 1,
    " What do you think of my doublet?": 1,
    "I asked.": 1,
    "He glanced at me.": 1,
    "That collar looks to be strangling you.": 1,
    " We will still see each other, I insisted.": 1,
    "We can still hunt and play cards and attend court.": 1,
    "Nothing need change.": 1,
    "George did not speak.": 1,
    " I am 23 years old.": 1,
    "It is time for me to marry and produce an heir.": 1,
    "It is expected of me.": 1,
    " George drained another glass of claret and turned to me.": 1,
    "Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials, James.": 1,
    "I'm sure you'll be content together.": 1,
    " He never used my nickname again.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
