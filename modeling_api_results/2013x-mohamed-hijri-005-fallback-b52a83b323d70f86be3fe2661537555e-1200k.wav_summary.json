    " So I want to start with a question to the public.": 1,
    "Who knows the problem of blue algae?": 1,
    " The majority of you agree that this is a serious problem.": 1,
    "No one wants to drink water contaminated by blue algae.": 1,
    "No one wants to swim in a lake contaminated by blue algae either.": 1,
    "Right?": 1,
    " So don't be disappointed.": 1,
    "Today, I don't want to talk about blue wings.": 1,
    "But on the contrary, I want to talk to you about the causes": 1,
    " and the main cause that leads us to this problem.": 1,
    "And this cause is what I would call the phosphor crisis.": 1,
    "Why did I choose to talk to you about this phosphor crisis?": 1,
    "Simply because no one talks about it.": 1,
    " And I would like, at the end of my presentation, that citizens, that the public, be aware of this crisis and this problem.": 1,
    " So the problem, unfortunately, if I ask the question of why we are here with the blue algae, the problem is that it comes from our agriculture, from our agriculture that uses fertilizers, chemical fertilizers.": 1,
    " Why does it use chemical fertilizers?": 1,
    "Simply to help plants grow and have a better yield.": 1,
    "The problem, unfortunately, is that this will cause an environmental problem, therefore unprecedented.": 1,
    " So we're going to do a little vegetable biology class before we start.": 1,
    "So what does a plant need to grow?": 1,
    "A plant simply needs light.": 1,
    " It needs CO2, but more importantly, it needs the nutrients that it will exhaust inside the soil.": 1,
    "Between these nutrients, there are several essential chemical elements, phosphorus,": 1,
    " Today I want to focus more on a major problem that is related to phosphorus.": 1,
    "Why phosphorus exactly?": 1,
    "Because it is the most problematic element.": 1,
    " So you will see that at the end of my presentation, what are these problems and where are we now?": 1,
    " So phosphorus, as I said, is a chemical element, an element that is essential in life.": 1,
    "And that's very important, I like that everyone understands exactly the issue of phosphorus.": 1,
    " Phosphor is a main component of several molecules, non-molecules, molecules of life.": 1,
    "For connoisseurs, cellular communication is done on the basis of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.": 1,
    " Our structures, the membranes, the cells are based on phosphors, so we are talking about phospholipids.": 1,
    " In our body, of everything that is alive, ATP is based on phosphor.": 1,
    "Even more important, phosphor is a main component of DNA, which everyone knows.": 1,
    " As you can see here in this image.": 1,
    "When we talk about DNA, it's our genetic heritage, it's extremely important, and if we talk about phosphorus, it's a key player.": 1,
    " So now, where are we going to get this phosphor?": 1,
    "The phosphor, for us humans, where are we going to get it, as I explained earlier, the plants are going to exhaust it inside the soil, through the water.": 1,
    " After that, we transmitted the old age that we eat.": 1,
    " plants, vegetables, fruits, vegetables, but also eggs, meat and milk.": 1,
    "Indeed, some humans eat better than others, some are happier than others.": 1,
    " And now we look at this image that speaks of itself, modern agriculture, or what I will also call intensive agriculture.": 1,
    "Intensive agriculture is based": 1,
    " on chemical fertilizers, on fertilizers.": 1,
    "Without fertilizers, we would not be able to produce enough to feed all humans.": 1,
    "And speaking of humans, currently, we are 7 billion humans on Earth.": 1,
    " In less than 40 years, we would be 9 billion.": 1,
    "And the question is simple.": 1,
    "Do we have enough phosphorus to feed?": 1,
    " Our future generations in this account.": 1,
    "So to understand these issues, where are we going to get the phosphor?": 1,
    "So I will explain.": 1,
    "So again, before we get there, let's suppose now that we use": 1,
    " a 100% phosphorus dose.": 1,
    "Out of this 100% phosphorus, 15% goes to the plant, and 85% is lost.": 1,
    " It will end up in the ground and end up in the lakes.": 1,
    " DELAC plus phosphor, problem of blue algae.": 1,
    "You will see here that something is wrong, something that is not logical.": 1,
    "We put 100% of phosphor and 15% goes to the plant.": 1,
    "You will tell me that this is waste.": 1,
    " Yes, it's even worse waste than that.": 1,
    "It's very expensive.": 1,
    "So nobody wants to throw their money out the window.": 1,
    "Unfortunately, that's what's happening right now.": 1,
    "On one dose of phosphor, 80% are lost.": 1,
    " So now our modern agriculture is based on the contribution of phosphorus.": 1,
    "We have to put it in.": 1,
    " Because almost 15% that goes to the plant, all the rest is lost, and we have to put more and more.": 1,
    "So now, where are we going to get that phosphor?": 1,
    " We're going to look for the phosphorus from the mines.": 1,
    "What you have here is an extraordinary article published in Nature in 2009.": 1,
    " that started to talk about the crisis of phosphorus, the problem of phosphorus, about an essential nutrient in life that is disappearing and nobody talks about it.": 1,
    "And everyone agrees, politicians, scientists.": 1,
    " agree that we are really going through a crisis of phosphorus.": 1,
    "What you see here is an open-air mine in the United States, and to give you an idea of the size and size of this mine, look at the small crane on the top right.": 1,
    "It's a giant crane.": 1,
    " So it really gives you a little bit of the size of the satellite.": 1,
    "So we're going to get this phosphor from the mines.": 1,
    "And here I do a comparison with oil.": 1,
    " We talk about climate change, but we don't talk about the phosphorus crisis.": 1,
    "If I take the problem of oil again, we can replace it.": 1,
    "We can use biofuel.": 1,
    " We can use solar energy, we can use hydro energy, but phosphorus is an essential element, indispensable in life.": 1,
    "We cannot replace it.": 1,
    " So now let's see what we have done with the world reserves of phosphorus.": 1,
    "This curve shows you what we have done so far.": 1,
    "The black curve shows us the predictions.": 1,
    " In 2030, we will reach the peak.": 1,
    "At the end of the century, there will be no more.": 1,
    " The pointed curves show us what we have done so far.": 1,
    "Indeed, it started in 2030.": 1,
    "I'm going to be retired at this point.": 1,
    " But we are actually dealing with a major problem, and I would like people to be aware of this problem.": 1,
    "So, do we have a solution?": 1,
    " Comment ce qu'on va faire?": 1,
    "On se retrouve dans un paradoxe.": 1,
    " On va voir de moins en moins.": 1,
    " In 2050, we would be 9 billion.": 1,
    "And according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, in 2050, we need to double the agricultural production that we have today.": 1,
    " So, on the one hand, we need to produce less phosphates.": 1,
    "What do we do?": 1,
    " So we are really facing a paradox.": 1,
    "Do we have a solution or an alternative that will allow us to optimize the use of phosphors?": 1,
    "Remember that 80% that we will put in will be lost.": 1,
    " So, the solution?": 1,
    " What I propose today is simply a solution that has existed for a very long time, well before plants existed on Earth, which is a small microscopic mushroom.": 1,
    " very mysterious, very simple and extremely complex.": 1,
    "And for more than 16 years, this little mushroom has...": 1,
    " and it's a model that I use to study my research in the laboratory.": 1,
    " This mushroom will live in symbiosis with roots.": 1,
    "When we talk about symbiosis, it's a bidirectional association.": 1,
    "The two partners profit and we call this association a mycorrhiza.": 1,
    " I will explain the mycorrhiz here.": 1,
    "You see a double root.": 1,
    " One of the most important plants in the world.": 1,
    "The root alone will go to get phosphor.": 1,
    "But it will go to get phosphor, yes, but barely the 1 mm that will surround this root.": 1,
    " Beyond one millimetre, the root is ineffective.": 1,
    "It can't go looking for phosphorus.": 1,
    "Imagine now the mushroom.": 1,
    "The mushroom is tiny and microscopic.": 1,
    " It has a much faster growth.": 1,
    "It has a much more efficient ability to get phosphor.": 1,
    "It will extend beyond the zone exploited by the root to get phosphor.": 1,
    "I have absolutely nothing to invent.": 1,
    "It is a biotechnology that exists for 450 million years.": 1,
    " And this mushroom was simply evolved and adapted to go and look for the slightest bit of phosphorus to exploit it and make it available to the plant.": 1,
    " Now, on this root, in the root of the carrot, you can see the very thin mushroom with its filaments.": 1,
    " And when you look at it closely, this mushroom will penetrate in a nice way, it will proliferate between the cells inside the root, and after a while it will penetrate inside the cell and will begin to form a typical structure.": 1,
    " This structure will allow for a considerable increase in the exchange interface between the mushroom and the plant.": 1,
    "And it is through this structure that there will be exchanges.": 1,
    " I give you phosphor and you feed me.": 1,
    "So it's really a real symbiosis.": 1,
    " So now, if I take the same graph, we're going to use a plant with a mycorrhiz.": 1,
    " And instead of using a 100% dose, I will reduce it to 25%.": 1,
    "So on this 25%, you will see that most of it will benefit the plant, more than 90%.": 1,
    "Very little.": 1,
    " They will be fixed on the ground naturally because they will be fixed on agnons.": 1,
    " Even more.": 1,
    "In some cases, we don't even need to use phosphorus.": 1,
    "If you remember the graphs I showed you earlier, 85% will get lost in the soil.": 1,
    "Yes, they will get stuck, but the plants...": 1,
    " They cannot access it, even if it is present in the soil.": 1,
    "It is in an insoluble form, and the plant can only look for forms that are soluble.": 1,
    "The mushroom is able to solubilize this insoluble form and make it available to the plant.": 1,
    " We'll be right back.": 1,
    " To convince you, this is really an image that speaks of itself, these are samples in the field, in a Zorgo production.": 1,
    "So you have on the right side, we used conventional agriculture with a 100% phosphorus dose.": 1,
    " On the other hand, we reduced the dose to 50% and looked at the yield.": 1,
    "With a low dose of 50%, we have a better yield.": 1,
    " So to show you, it's something that works and works, and in some cases, especially in": 1,
    " In Cuba, in Mexico, in India, we can reduce it to 25% and in several cases, we don't even need to increase it because they are adapted to go and look for more phosphorus from the ground.": 1,
    " This is another example from the Canadian soil production.": 1,
    "You see in a field where we used mycorrhiz and a field where we didn't.": 1,
    " And in this case, there is really a better rendering, so it's visible, so it's on the color index, so blue, we have a better rendering.": 1,
    " yellow, we have less rounding.": 1,
    "And the square, the rectangle in black, so it's the plot from which we added the mycorrhiz.": 1,
    " In other words, the mycorrhiz, as I said, I didn't invent anything, so it exists in nature for 450 million years, which even helped the plants diversify today.": 1,
    " Again, it's not something that we are testing in the laboratory.": 1,
    "The mycorrhiz therefore exists, it works, it is produced on an industrial scale and it is marketed throughout the world.": 1,
    " And the problem is that people are not aware of this, and producers and farmers are not aware of this problem.": 1,
    " We have a technology that works, and if we use it and exploit it correctly, it will allow us to release the pressure that we are currently exerting on the world's phosphorus reserves.": 1,
    " To conclude, I am a scientist, a dreamer.": 1,
    "I am passionate.": 1,
    "If you ask me what my dream would be when I retire, when we reach the peak of phosphorus,": 1,
    " In my dream, it would be that we use a label, a label with my choruses, that my children or my grandchildren will buy in the market and that it will be marked produced by my choruses.": 1,
    "And I thank you for your attention.": 1
