    " I got my start in writing and research as a surgical trainee, as someone who was a long ways away from becoming any kind of an expert at anything.": 1,
    " So the natural question you ask then at that point is how do I get good at what I'm trying to do?": 1,
    "And it became a question of how do we all get good at what we're trying to do?": 1,
    "It's hard enough to learn to get the skills.": 1,
    " try to learn all the material you have to absorb at any task you're taking on.": 1,
    "I had to think about how I sew and how I cut, but then also how I pick the right person to come to an operating room.": 1,
    " And then in the midst of all this came this new context for thinking about what it meant to be good.": 1,
    " In the last few years, we realized we're in the deepest crisis of medicine's existence due to something you don't normally think about when you're a doctor concerned with how you do good for people, which is the cost.": 1,
    " of healthcare.": 1,
    " There's not a country in the world that now is not asking whether we can afford what doctors do.": 1,
    " The political fight that we've developed has become one around whether it's the government that's the problem or is it insurance companies that are the problem.": 1,
    " And the answer is yes.": 1,
    "And no.": 1,
    "It's deeper than all of that.": 1,
    "The cause of our troubles is actually the complexity that's science.": 1,
    " has given us.": 1,
    "In order to understand this, I'm going to take you back a couple of generations.": 1,
    " I want to take you back to a time when Lewis Thomas was writing in his book, The Youngest Science.": 1,
    "Lewis Thomas was a physician writer, one of my favorite writers.": 1,
    " And he wrote this book to explain, among other things, what it was like to be a medical intern at the Boston City Hospital in the pre-penicillin year of 1937.": 1,
    " It was a time when medicine was cheap.": 1,
    " and very ineffective.": 1,
    " If you were in a hospital, he said, it was going to do you good only because it offered you some warmth.": 1,
    " some food, shelter, and maybe the caring attention of a nurse, doctors and medicine.": 1,
    " made no difference at all.": 1,
    "That didn't seem to prevent the doctors from being frantically busy in their days as he explained.": 1,
    "What they were trying to do was figure out whether you might have": 1,
    " one of the diagnoses for which they could do something.": 1,
    "And there were a few.": 1,
    "You might have a low-bar pneumonia, for example, and they could give you an anti-serum, an injection of rabid antibodies.": 1,
    " to the bacterium streptococcus if the intern subtyped it correctly.": 1,
    "If you had an acute": 1,
    " congestive heart failure, they could bleed a pint of blood from you by opening up an arm vein, giving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis, and then giving you oxygen by tent.": 1,
    " If you had early signs of paralysis and you were really good at asking personal questions, you might figure out that this paralysis someone has is from syphilis.": 1,
    " in which case you could give this nice concoction of mercury and arsenic.": 1,
    " as long as you didn't overdose them and kill them.": 1,
    " Beyond these sorts of things, a medical doctor didn't have a lot that they could do.": 1,
    " This was when the core structure of medicine was created.": 1,
    "What it meant to be good at what we did and how we wanted to build medicine to be.": 1,
    "It was at a time": 1,
    " when what was known, you could know, you could hold it all in your head, and you could do it all.": 1,
    "If you had a prescription pad,": 1,
    " If you had a nurse, if you had a hospital that would give you a place to convalesce, maybe some basic tools, you really could do it all.": 1,
    "You set the fracture.": 1,
    " Drew the blood you spun the blood and looked at it under the microscope you plated the culture you injected the anti serum this was.": 1,
    " a life as a craftsman.": 1,
    "As a result, we built it around a culture and set of values that said what you were good at was being daring.": 1,
    " At being courageous, at being independent and self-sufficient, autonomy was our highest value.": 1,
    " go a couple generations forward to where we are though and it looks like a completely different world we have now found treatments": 1,
    " for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions that a human being can have.": 1,
    "We can't cure it all.": 1,
    "We can't guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life.": 1,
    "But we can make it possible for most.": 1,
    " But what does it take?": 1,
    "We've now discovered 4,000 medical and surgical procedures.": 1,
    "We've discovered 6,000 drugs that I'm now licensed to prescribe.": 1,
    " And we're trying to deploy this capability town by town to every person alive.": 1,
    " in our own country, let alone around the world.": 1,
    "And we've reached the point where we've realized as doctors,": 1,
    " We can't know it all.": 1,
    "We can't do it all by ourselves.": 1,
    "There was a study where they looked at": 1,
    " how many clinicians it took to take care of you if you came into a hospital as it changed over time.": 1,
    "And in the year 1970, it took just over two full-time equivalents of clinicians.": 1,
    "That is to say, it took basically the nursing time,": 1,
    " I'll be right back.": 1,
    " And then just a little bit of time for a doctor who more or less checked in on you once a day.": 1,
    "By the end of the 20th century, it had become more than 15 clinicians for the same typical hospital patient.": 1,
    " specialists, physical therapists, the nurses.": 1,
    " We're all specialists now, even the primary care physicians.": 1,
    "Everyone just has a piece of the care.": 1,
    " But holding on to that structure we built around the daring independence, self-sufficiency of each of those people has become a disaster.": 1,
    " We have trained, hired, and rewarded people to be cowboys.": 1,
    " But it's pit crews that we need.": 1,
    "Pit crews for patients.": 1,
    " There's evidence all around us 40 percent of our coronary artery disease patients in our communities receive incomplete or inappropriate care.": 1,
    "Sixty percent.": 1,
    " of our asthma, stroke patients receive incomplete or inappropriate care.": 1,
    " 2 million people come into hospitals and pick up an infection they didn't have.": 1,
    " because someone failed to follow the basic practices of hygiene.": 1,
    " Our experience as people who get sick need help from other people is that we have amazing clinicians that we can turn to.": 1,
    "Hard working, incredibly well trained, very smart.": 1,
    " that we have access to incredible technologies that give us great hope, but little sense that it consistently all comes together for you, from start to finish.": 1,
    " in a successful way.": 1,
    "There's another sign that we need pit crews, and that's the unmanageable cost of our care.": 1,
    " Now, we in medicine, I think, are baffled by this question of cost.": 1,
    "We want to say this is just the way it is.": 1,
    " This is just what medicine requires.": 1,
    "When you go from a world where you treated arthritis with aspirin that mostly didn't do the job,": 1,
    " to one where if it gets bad enough, we can do a hip replacement, a knee replacement that gives you years, maybe decades.": 1,
    " Without disability, a dramatic change.": 1,
    "Well, is it any surprise that that $40,000 hip replacement, replacing the 10-cent aspirin, is more expensive?": 1,
    "It's just the way it is.": 1,
    " but I think we're ignoring certain facts that tell us something about what we can do.": 1,
    " As we've looked at the data about the results that have come as the complexity of increased, we found that the most expensive care": 1,
    " is not necessarily the best care.": 1,
    "And vice versa.": 1,
    "The best care often turns out to be the least expensive.": 1,
    "It has fewer complications.": 1,
    "The people get more efficient at what they do.": 1,
    " And what that means is there's hope.": 1,
    " Because to have the best results, you really needed the most expensive care in the country or in the world.": 1,
    "Well, then we really would be talking about rationing.": 1,
    "Who we're going to cut off of Medicare?": 1,
    " That would be really our only choice.": 1,
    " But when we look at the positive deviants, the ones who are getting the best results at the lowest costs,": 1,
    " We find the ones that look most like systems are the most successful.": 1,
    "That is to say, they found ways to get all of the different pieces, all of the different components to come together into a whole.": 1,
    " Having great components is not enough, and yet we've been obsessed in medicine with components.": 1,
    "We want the best drugs, the best technologies, the best specialists.": 1,
    " But we don't think too much about how it all comes together.": 1,
    "It's a terrible design strategy, actually.": 1,
    " Well, there's a famous thought experiment that touches exactly on this.": 1,
    "They said, what if you built a car from the very best car parts?": 1,
    " Well, it would lead you to put in Porsche brakes, a Ferrari engine, a Volvo body, a BMW chassis, and you put it all together and what do you get?": 1,
    "A very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere.": 1,
    " And that is what medicine can feel like sometimes.": 1,
    " It's not a system.": 1,
    " Now a system, however, when things start to come together,": 1,
    " you realize it has certain skills for acting and looking that way.": 1,
    "Skill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure.": 1,
    "When you are a specialist, you can't see": 1,
    " the end result very well.": 1,
    "You have to become really interested in data.": 1,
    "Unsexy as that sounds.": 1,
    " One of my colleagues is a surgeon in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and he got interested in the question of, well, how many CT scans did they do for their community in Cedar Rapids?": 1,
    " He got interested in this because there had been government reports, newspaper reports, a journal article saying that there had been too many CT scans done.": 1,
    "He didn't see it in his own patients.": 1,
    " And so he asked the question, how many did we do?": 1,
    "And he wanted to get the data.": 1,
    "It took him three months.": 1,
    "No one had asked this question in his community before.": 1,
    " And what he found was that for the 300,000 people in their community, in the previous year they had done 52,000 CT scans.": 1,
    " they had found a problem.": 1,
    " Which brings us to skill number two a system has.": 1,
    "Skill one, find where your failures are.": 1,
    "Skill two is devise solutions.": 1,
    " I got interested in this when the World Health Organization came to my team asking if we could help with a project to reduce deaths in surgery.": 1,
    "The volume of surgery had spread around the world, but the safety of surgery had not.": 1,
    " Now our usual tactics for tackling problems like these are to do more training, give people more specialization, or bring in more technology.": 1,
    " Well in surgery you couldn't have people who are more specialized and you couldn't have people who are better trained and yet we see unconscionable levels of": 1,
    " death, disability that could be avoided.": 1,
    " And so we looked at what other high-risk industries do.": 1,
    "We looked at skyscraper construction.": 1,
    "We looked at the aviation world.": 1,
    "And we found that they have technology.": 1,
    "They have training.": 1,
    "And then they have one other thing they have.": 1,
    " Checklists.": 1,
    "I did not expect to be spending a significant part of my time as a Harvard surgeon worrying about checklists.": 1,
    " And yet what we found were that these were tools to help make experts better.": 1,
    " We got the lead safety engineer for Boeing to help us.": 1,
    "Could we design a checklist for surgery, not for the lowest people on the tonal bowl, but for the folks who were": 1,
    " all the way around the chain, the entire team, including the surgeons.": 1,
    "And what they taught us was that designing a checklist to help people handle complexity actually": 1,
    " involves more difficulty than I had understood.": 1,
    "You have to think about things like pause points.": 1,
    "You need to identify the moments in a process when you can actually catch a problem before it's a danger and do something about it.": 1,
    " you have to identify that this is a before takeoff checklist.": 1,
    "And then you need to focus on the killer items.": 1,
    " An aviation checklist like this one for a single engine plane isn't a recipe for how to fly a plane.": 1,
    "It's a reminder of the key things that get forgotten.": 1,
    " or missed if they're not checked.": 1,
    "So we did this.": 1,
    "We created a 19-item, two-minute checklist": 1,
    " for surgical teams.": 1,
    "We had the pause points immediately before anesthesia is given, immediately before the knife hits the skin, immediately before the patient leaves the room.": 1,
    " And we had a mix of dumb stuff on there, making sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame because that cuts the infection rate by half.": 1,
    " And then interesting stuff because you can't make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery.": 1,
    "Instead, you can make a recipe for how to have a team that's prepared for the unexpected.": 1,
    " And we had items like making sure everyone in the room had introduced themselves by name at the start of the day, because you have half a dozen people or more who are sometimes coming together as a team for the very first time that day that you're coming in.": 1,
    " We implemented this checklist in eight hospitals around the world, deliberately in places from rural Tanzania to the University of Washington in Seattle.": 1,
    " We found that after they adopted it, the complication rates fell 35%.": 1,
    "It fell in every hospital it went into.": 1,
    "The death rates fell 47%.": 1,
    " This was bigger than a drug.": 1,
    " And that brings us to skill number three.": 1,
    " the ability to implement this, to get colleagues across the entire chain to actually do these things.": 1,
    " And it's been slow to spread.": 1,
    "This is not yet our norm in surgery, let alone making checklists to go on to childbirth and other areas.": 1,
    " There's a deep resistance because using these tools forces us to confront that we're not a system.": 1,
    " forces us to behave with a different set of values.": 1,
    "Just using a checklist requires you to embrace different values from ones we've had, like humility.": 1,
    " discipline.": 1,
    " Teamwork.": 1,
    " This is the opposite of what we were built on.": 1,
    "Independence, self-sufficiency, autonomy.": 1,
    " I met an actual cowboy, by the way.": 1,
    "I asked him, what was it like to actually herd 1,000 cattle across hundreds of miles?": 1,
    "How did you do that?": 1,
    " And he said, we have the Cowboys stationed at distinct places all around.": 1,
    "They communicate electronically constantly.": 1,
    "And they have protocols and checklists for how they handle everything from": 1,
    " bad weather to emergencies or inoculations for the cattle.": 1,
    " Even the cowboys are pit crews now.": 1,
    "And it seemed like time that we become that way ourselves.": 1,
    "Making systems work is the great task of my generation of physicians and scientists.": 1,
    " But I would go further and say that making systems work, whether in healthcare, education, climate change, making a pathway out of poverty, is the great task of our generation as a whole.": 1,
    " In every field, knowledge has exploded, but it has brought complexity.": 1,
    "It has brought specialization.": 1,
    " And we've come to a place where we have no choice but to recognize as individualistic as we want to be, complexity requires group success.": 1,
    " We all need to be pit crews now.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
