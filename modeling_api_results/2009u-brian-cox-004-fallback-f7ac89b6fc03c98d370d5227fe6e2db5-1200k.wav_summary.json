    " As Bruno said, last year at TED, I gave an introduction to the LHC, and I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine works.": 1,
    " So this is it.": 1,
    "For those of you that weren't there, the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted, 27 kilometres in circumference.": 1,
    "His job is to recreate the conditions that were present": 1,
    " Less than a billionth of a second after the universe began, up to 600 million times a second.": 1,
    "So nothing if not ambitious.": 1,
    "This is the machine below Geneva.": 1,
    "We take the pictures of those mini big bangs in size detectors.": 1,
    "This is the one I work on.": 1,
    "It's called the Atlas Detector.": 1,
    " 44 meters wide, 22 meters in diameter.": 1,
    "Spectacular picture here of Atlas under construction, so you can see the scale.": 1,
    " On the 10th of September last year, we turned the machine on for the first time, and this picture was taken by Atlas.": 1,
    "It caused immense celebration in the control room.": 1,
    " It's a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC, colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately, and showering particles into the detector.": 1,
    "In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10th, we knew the machine worked, which is a great triumph.": 1,
    " I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer or this when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that.": 1,
    "It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact.": 1,
    "About a week later, we had a problem with the machine.": 1,
    " Related actually to these bits of wire here, these gold wires.": 1,
    "Those wires carry 13,000 amps when the machine's working at full power.": 1,
    "Now, the engineers amongst you will look at them and say, no, they don't.": 1,
    "They're small wires.": 1,
    " They can do that because when they're very cold, they're what's called superconducting wire.": 1,
    "So at minus 271 degrees colder than the space between the stars, those wires can take that current.": 1,
    " In one of the joins between over 9,000 magnets in LHC, there was a manufacturing defect so the wire heated up slightly and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance.": 1,
    "This was the result.": 1,
    " Now that's more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons and they moved about a foot.": 1,
    " So we damaged about 50 of the magnets.": 1,
    "We had to take them out, which we did.": 1,
    "We've reconditioned them all, fixed them.": 1,
    "They're all on their way back underground now.": 1,
    "By the end of March, the LHC will be intact again.": 1,
    " We will switch it on and we expect to take data in June or July.": 1,
    "And continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are.": 1,
    " Now, of course, in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge.": 1,
    " It's easy to refuse, I think, that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that we're overreaching is the value of things like the LHC.": 1,
    " I'll leave the final word to an English scientist, Humphry Davy, who I suspect, when defending his prot\u00e9g\u00e9's useless experiments, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was Michael Faraday,": 1,
    " said this, nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate.": 1,
    " that there are no mysteries in nature, that our triumphs are complete, and that there are no new worlds to conquer.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
