    " Photography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera.": 1,
    "But today, I want to share with you the 15 most treasured photos of mine.": 1,
    " And I didn't take any of them.": 1,
    "There were no art directors, no stylists, no chance for reshoots, not even any regard for lighting.": 1,
    "In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists.": 1,
    " My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement, and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday.": 1,
    "We're on the corner of 57th and 5th.": 1,
    " We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.": 1,
    " Well, you can see where this is going.": 1,
    "Approaching my daughter's third birthday, my wife said, hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father-daughter trip and continue the ritual?": 1,
    " This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture.": 1,
    "You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger.": 1,
    "No one's ever refused, and luckily no one's ever run off with our camera.": 1,
    " Back then, we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives.": 1,
    "It's really become sacred to us.": 1,
    "This one was taken just weeks after 9-11, and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five-year-old could understand.": 1,
    " So these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment or even a specific trip.": 1,
    " There are also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October.": 1,
    " and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year.": 1,
    "And not just physically, but in every way.": 1,
    "Because while we take the same photo, our perspectives change.": 1,
    " and she reaches new milestones.": 1,
    " And I get to see life through her eyes and how she interacts with and sees everything.": 1,
    " This very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year.": 1,
    " Recently, on one trip, we were walking, and she stops dead in her tracks, and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little.": 1,
    " on our earlier trips.": 1,
    "And she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot.": 1,
    " She said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier.": 1,
    "And now what she's looking at in New York are colleges.": 1,
    " because she's determined to go to school in New York.": 1,
    "And it hit me.": 1,
    "One of the most important things we all make are memories.": 1,
    " So I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories.": 1,
    " I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 shots, I'm not in many of the family photos.": 1,
    "I'm always the one taking the picture.": 1,
    "So I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot.": 1,
    " And don't hesitate to go up to someone and ask, will you take our picture?": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
