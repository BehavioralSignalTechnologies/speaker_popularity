    "Thank you.": 2,
    " I'm a savant, or more precisely, a high functioning autistic savant.": 1,
    " It's a rare condition, and rare still when accompanied, as in my case, by self-awareness and a mastery of language.": 1,
    " Very often when I meet someone and they learn this about me, there's a certain kind of awkwardness.": 1,
    "I can see it in their eyes.": 1,
    "They want to ask me something.": 1,
    " And in the end, quite often, the urge is stronger than they are.": 1,
    "And they blurt it out.": 1,
    "If I give you my date of birth, can you tell me what day of the week I was born on?": 1,
    " or they mention cube roots or ask me to recite a long number or a long text.": 1,
    "I hope you'll forgive me.": 1,
    " if I don't perform a kind of one-man savant show for you today.": 1,
    " I am going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or": 1,
    " and a lot closer to my mind and work.": 1,
    "I want to talk to you briefly about perception.": 1,
    " when he was writing the plays and the short stories that would make his name, Anton Chekhov, Captain Notebook.": 1,
    " in which he noted down his observations of the world around him.": 1,
    "Little details that other people seemed to miss.": 1,
    " Every time I read Chekhov and his unique vision of human life, I'm reminded of why I too became a writer.": 1,
    " In my books, I explore the nature of perception and how different kinds of perceiving create different kinds of knowing and understanding.": 1,
    " Here are three questions drawn from my work.": 1,
    "Rather than try to figure them out, I'm going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions.": 1,
    " and the gut instincts that are going through your head and your heart as you look at them.": 1,
    " For example, the calculation.": 1,
    "Can you feel where on the number line the solution is likely to fall?": 1,
    "Or look at the foreign word and the sounds.": 1,
    "Can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it's pointing you towards?": 1,
    " And in terms of the line of poetry, why does the poet use the word hare, ravel and rabbit?": 1,
    " I'm asking you to do this because I believe that our personal perceptions, you see, are at the heart of how we acquire knowledge.": 1,
    "Aesthetic judgments, ravel and abstract reasoning,": 1,
    " guide and shape the process by which we all come to know what we know.": 1,
    " I'm an extreme example of this.": 1,
    "My worlds of words and numbers blur with colour, emotion and personality.": 1,
    " As Juan said, it's a condition that scientists call synesthesia, an unusual cross-talk between the senses.": 1,
    " Here are the numbers 1 to 12, as I see them.": 1,
    "Every number with its own shape and character.": 1,
    "One is a flash of bright light.": 1,
    "Six.": 1,
    " is a tiny and very sad black hole.": 1,
    "The sketches are in black and white here, but in my mind they have colours.": 1,
    "Three is green, four is blue, five is yellow.": 1,
    " I paint as well.": 1,
    "And here is one of my paintings.": 1,
    " It's a multiplication of two prime numbers.": 1,
    " three-dimensional shapes, and the space they create in the middle creates a new shape, the answer to the sum.": 1,
    " What about bigger numbers?": 1,
    "Well, you can't get much bigger than pi, the mathematical constant.": 1,
    "It's an infinite number, literally goes on forever.": 1,
    " In this painting that I made of the first 20 decimals of pi, I take the colours.": 1,
    " and the emotions and the textures, and I pull them all together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape.": 1,
    "But it's not only numbers that I see in colors.": 1,
    " Words too, for me, have colours and emotions and textures.": 1,
    "And this is an opening phrase from the novel Lolita.": 1,
    " And Nabokov was himself synesthetic.": 1,
    "And you can see here how my perception of the sound L helps the alliteration to jump right out.": 1,
    " another example, a little bit more mathematical, and I wonder if some of you will notice the construction of the sentence from the Great Gatsby.": 1,
    " there is a procession of syllables.": 1,
    " Wheat, one.": 1,
    "Prairies, two.": 1,
    "Lost Swede towns, three.": 1,
    "One, two, three.": 1,
    "And this effect is very pleasant on the mind.": 1,
    " and it helps the sentence to feel right.": 1,
    " Let's go back to the questions I posed you a moment ago.": 1,
    "64 multiplied by 75.": 1,
    "If some of you play chess, you'll know that 64 is a square number.": 1,
    " And that's why chess boards eight by eight have 64 squares.": 1,
    "So that gives us a form that we can picture, that we can perceive.": 1,
    " What about 75?": 1,
    "Well, if we think of 100 as being like a square, 75 would look like this.": 1,
    " So what we need to do now is put those two pictures together in our mind.": 1,
    "Something like this.": 1,
    " 64 becomes 6,400.": 1,
    " And in the right-hand corner, you don't have to calculate anything.": 1,
    "Four across, four up and down, it's 16.": 1,
    " So what the sum is actually asking you to do is 16, 16, 16.": 1,
    "That's a lot easier than the way that a school taught you to do maths, I'm sure.": 1,
    " It's 16, 16, 16, 48, 4800, 4800, the answer to the sum.": 1,
    " easier when you know how.": 1,
    " The second question was an Icelandic word.": 1,
    "I'm assuming there are not many people here who speak Icelandic.": 1,
    "So let me narrow the choices down to two.": 1,
    " Schnyggen.": 1,
    " Is it a happy word or a sad word?": 1,
    "What do you say?": 1,
    " Okay.": 1,
    "Some people say it's happy.": 1,
    "Most people, a majority of people, say sad.": 1,
    " It does mean sad.": 1,
    " Why do, statistically, a majority of people say that a word is sad in this case, heavy in other cases?": 1,
    " In my theory, language evolves in such a way that sounds match, correspond with the subjective, with the personal intuitive experience of the listener.": 1,
    " Let's have a look at the third question.": 1,
    " a line from a poem by John Keats.": 1,
    "Words like numbers": 1,
    " express fundamental relationships between objects and events and forces that constitute our world.": 1,
    "It stands to reason that we existing in this world": 1,
    " should, in the course of our lives, absorb intuitively those relationships.": 1,
    "And poets, like other artists, play with those intuitive understandings.": 1,
    "In the case of hair, it's an ambiguous sound.": 1,
    " It can also mean the fibres that grow from our head.": 1,
    "And if we think of that, let me put the picture up.": 1,
    " The fibers represent vulnerability.": 1,
    "They yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion.": 1,
    " What you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension.": 1,
    "The hair itself, the animal, not a cat, not a dog, a hare.": 1,
    "Why a hare?": 1,
    "Because...": 1,
    " Think of the picture, not the word, the picture.": 1,
    "The over long ears, the over large feet helps us to picture, to feel intuitively what it means to limp and to tremble.": 1,
    " So in these few minutes, I hope I've been able to share a little bit of my vision of things and to show you that words can have colors and emotions, numbers,": 1,
    " shapes and personalities.": 1,
    "The world is richer, vaster than it too often seems to be.": 1,
    " I hope that I've given you the desire to learn to see the world with new eyes.": 1,
    " Thank you so much.": 1
