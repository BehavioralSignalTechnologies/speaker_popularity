    " Well, I was born with a rare visual condition called achromatopsia, which is total color blindness.": 1,
    "So I've never seen color and I don't know what color looks like.": 1,
    " because I come from a greyscale world.": 1,
    "To me the sky is always grey, flowers are always grey and television is still in black and white.": 1,
    " But since the age of 21, instead of seeing color, I can hear color.": 1,
    "In 2003, I started a project with computer scientist Adam Montandon.": 1,
    " The result with further collaborations with Peter Keshe from Slovenia and Matias Lizana from Barcelona is this electronic eye.": 1,
    "It's a color sensor that detects the color frequency in front of me.": 1,
    " and send this frequency to a chip installed at the back of my head, and I hear the color in front of me through the bone, through bone conduction.": 1,
    "So for example, if I have like...": 1,
    " This is the sound of purple.": 1,
    " For example, this is": 1,
    " The sound of... grass?": 1,
    " This is red, like Ted.": 1,
    "This is the sound of a dirty sock.": 1,
    " which is like yellow, this one.": 1,
    "So I've been hearing color all the time for eight years, since 2004, so I find it completely normal now to hear color all the time.": 1,
    " At the start, though, I had to memorize the names you give for each color, so I had to memorize the notes, but after some time, all this information became a perception.": 1,
    "I didn't have to think about the notes.": 1,
    " And after some time, this perception became a feeling.": 1,
    "I started to have favorite colors and I started to dream in color.": 1,
    "So, when I started to dream in color is when I felt that the software and my brain had united.": 1,
    " In my dreams, it was my brain creating electronic sounds.": 1,
    "It wasn't the software.": 1,
    "So that's when I started to feel like a cyborg.": 1,
    "It's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device was no longer.": 1,
    " device.": 1,
    "It had become a part of my body, an extension of my senses, and after some time it even became a part of my official image.": 1,
    " This is my passport from 2004.": 1,
    "You're not allowed to appear on UK passports with electronic equipment.": 1,
    "But I insisted to the passport office that what they were seeing": 1,
    " was actually a new part of my body, an extension of my brain, and they finally accepted me to appear with a passport for them.": 1,
    " So life has changed dramatically since I hear color because color is almost everywhere.": 1,
    "So biggest changes, for example, is going to an art gallery.": 1,
    "I can listen.": 1,
    " to a Picasso, for example.": 1,
    "So it's like going to a concert hall because I can listen to the paintings.": 1,
    "And supermarkets, I find this is very shocking, very, very attractive to walk along a supermarket.": 1,
    "It's like going to a nightclub.": 1,
    "It's full of different...": 1,
    " Melodies yeah, especially the aisle with cleaning products.": 1,
    "It's just fabulous": 1,
    " Also, the way I dress has changed.": 1,
    "Before I used to dress in a way that it looked good, now I dress in a way that it sounds good.": 1,
    " Yeah.": 1,
    " So today I'm dressed in C major, so it's quite a happy chord.": 1,
    "If I had to go to a funeral though, I would dress in B minor, which would be turquoise, purple and orange.": 1,
    " Also food, the way I look at food has changed because now I can display the food on a plate.": 1,
    " So I can eat my favorite song.": 1,
    "So depending on how I display it, I can hear and I can compose music with food.": 1,
    "So imagine a restaurant where we can have like Lady Gaga salads as starters.": 1,
    " This would get teenagers to eat their vegetables, probably.": 1,
    "And also some Rachmaninoff piano concertos as main dishes and some Bj\u00f6rk or Madonna desserts.": 1,
    "That would be...": 1,
    " a very exciting restaurant where you can actually eat songs.": 1,
    "Also, the way I perceive beauty has changed because": 1,
    " When I look at someone, I hear their face, so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible.": 1,
    " It might happen the opposite the other way around.": 1,
    "So I really enjoy creating like sound portraits of people instead of drawing someone's...": 1,
    " face, like drawing the shape, I point at them with the eye and I write down the different notes I hear.": 1,
    "And then I create sound portraits.": 1,
    "Here's some faces.": 1,
    " you": 1,
    " Yeah, Nicole Kidman sounds good.": 1,
    "Some people I would never relate, but they sound similar.": 1,
    "Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman.": 1,
    "They have similar sound of eyes.": 1,
    "So you relate people that you wouldn't relate.": 1,
    " And you can actually also create concerts by looking at the audience faces.": 1,
    "So I connect the eye and then I play the audience's faces.": 1,
    "The good thing about this is if the concert doesn't sound good, it's their fault.": 1,
    "It's not my fault.": 1,
    " And so another thing that happens is that I started having this secondary effect, that normal sounds started to become color.": 1,
    " telephone tone and it felt green because it sounded just like the color green.": 1,
    "The BBC beeps, they sound turquoise and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience.": 1,
    "So I started to": 1,
    " paint music and paint people's voices, because people's voices have frequencies that I relate to color.": 1,
    "And here's some music translated into color.": 1,
    "For example, Mozart.": 1,
    " Queen of the night looks like this.": 1,
    "Very yellow and very colorful because there's many different frequencies.": 1,
    " And this is a completely different song.": 1,
    "It's Justin Bieber's Baby.": 1,
    " It's very pink and very yellow": 1,
    " So, also voices, I can transform speeches into color.": 1,
    "For example, these are two very well-known speeches.": 1,
    " One of them is Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream and the other one is Hitler.": 1,
    "And I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls without labels and then I ask people, which one do you prefer?": 1,
    " And most people change their preference when I tell them that the one on the left is Hitler and the one on the right is Martin Luther King.": 1,
    " So I got to a point when I was able to perceive 360 colors, just like human vision.": 1,
    "I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel, but then...": 1,
    " I just thought that this human vision wasn't good enough.": 1,
    "There's many, many more colors around us that we cannot perceive.": 1,
    " but the electronic eyes can't perceive so I decided to continue extending my color senses and I added infrared and I added ultraviolet": 1,
    " to the color to sound scale.": 1,
    "So now I can hear colors that the human eye cannot perceive.": 1,
    "For example, perceiving infrared is good because you can actually": 1,
    " detectives, there's movement detectors in a room, I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control.": 1,
    "And the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that you can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe.": 1,
    " Because ultraviolet is a dangerous color that can actually kill us.": 1,
    "So I think we should all have this wish to perceive things that we cannot perceive.": 1,
    " That's why two years ago I created the Cyborg Foundation, which is a foundation that tries to help people become a cyborg, tries to encourage people to extend their senses by using technology as part of the body.": 1,
    " We should all think that knowledge comes from our senses, so if we extend our senses, we will consequently extend our knowledge.": 1,
    "I think life will be much more exciting when we": 1,
    " stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body.": 1,
    "I think this will be a big, big change that we'll see during this century.": 1,
    "So I do encourage you all.": 1,
    " to think about which senses you'd like to extend, I would encourage you to become a cyborg.": 1,
    "You won't be alone.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
