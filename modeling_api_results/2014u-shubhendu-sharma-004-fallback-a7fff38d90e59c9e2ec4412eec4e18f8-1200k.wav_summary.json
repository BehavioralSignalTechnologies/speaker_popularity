    " I'm an industrial engineer.": 1,
    "The goal in my life has always been to make more and more products in the least amount of time and resources.": 1,
    " While working at Toyota, all I knew was how to make cars until I met Dr. Akira Miyawaki, who came to our factory to make a forest in it in order to make it carbon neutral.": 1,
    " I was so fascinated that I decided to learn this methodology by joining his team as a volunteer.": 1,
    "Soon, I started making a forest in the backyard of my own house, and this is how it looks after three years.": 1,
    " These forests, compared to a conventional plantation, grows 10 times faster.": 1,
    "They are 30 times more dense and 100 times more biodiverse.": 1,
    " Within two years of having this forest in our backyard, I could observe that the groundwater didn't dry during summers.": 1,
    "The number of bird species spotted in this area doubled.": 1,
    " Quality of air became better and we started harvesting seasonal fruits, growing effortlessly right in the backyard of our house.": 1,
    " I wanted to make more of these forests.": 1,
    "I was so moved by these results that I wanted to make these forests with the same acumen with which we make cars or write software or do any mainstream business.": 1,
    " So I formed a company which is an end-to-end service provider to create these native natural forests.": 1,
    " But to make a forestation as a mainstream business or an industry, we had to standardize the process of forest making.": 1,
    "So we benchmarked the Toyota production system known for its quality and efficiency.": 1,
    " for the process of forest making.": 1,
    "For an example, the core of TPS, Toyota Production System, lies in Hyjunka, which is manufacturing of different models of cars on a single assembly line.": 1,
    " We replace these cars with trees, using which now we can make multi-layer forest.": 1,
    "These forests utilize 100% vertical space.": 1,
    "They are so dense that one can't even walk into them.": 1,
    " For an example, we can make a 300 trees forest in area as small as parking spaces of six cars.": 1,
    " In order to reduce cost and our own carbon footprint, we started utilizing local biomass as soil ammender and fertilizers.": 1,
    "For an example, coconut shells crushed in a machine mixed with rice straw.": 1,
    " powder of rice husk mixed with organic manure is finally dumped in soil on which our forest is planted.": 1,
    "Once planted, we use grass or rice straw to cover the soil.": 1,
    " so that all the water which goes into irrigation doesn't get back evaporated into atmosphere.": 1,
    "And using these simple improvisations, today we can make a forest for cost as low as cost of an iPhone.": 1,
    " Today we are making forests in houses, in schools, even in factories with the corporates.": 1,
    "But that's not enough.": 1,
    "There is a huge number of people who want to take matters in their own hands.": 1,
    "So we let it happen.": 1,
    " Today we are working on an internet-based platform where we are going to share our methodology on an open source, using which anyone and everyone can make their own forest without our physical presence being there.": 1,
    " using our methodology.": 1,
    "On a click of a button they can get to know all the native species of their place.": 1,
    " By installing a small hardware probe on site, we can do remotely soil testing.": 1,
    " using which we can give step-by-step instructions of forest making remotely.": 1,
    "Also, we can monitor the growth of this forest without being on site.": 1,
    " This methodology, I believe, has a potential by sharing.": 1,
    "We can actually bring back our native forest.": 1,
    "Now, when you go back home, if you see a barren piece of land, do remember that it can be a potential forest.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1,
    "Thanks.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
