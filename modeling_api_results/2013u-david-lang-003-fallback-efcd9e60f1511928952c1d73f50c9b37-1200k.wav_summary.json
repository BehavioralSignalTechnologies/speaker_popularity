    " So this video was taken at Aquarius Undersea Laboratory, four miles off the coast of Key Largo, about 60 feet below the surface.": 1,
    "NASA uses this extreme environment to train astronauts and aquanauts.": 1,
    " And last year they invited us along for the ride.": 1,
    "All the footage was taken from our OpenROV, which is a robot that we built in our garage.": 1,
    " So ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle, which in our case means our little robot sends live video across that ultra-thin tether back to the computer top side.": 1,
    " It's open source, meaning we publish and share all of our design files and all of our code online, allowing anyone to modify or improve or change the design.": 1,
    " It's built with mostly off-the-shelf parts and costs about a thousand times cheaper than the ROVs James Cameron used to explore the Titanic.": 1,
    " So ROVs aren't new.": 1,
    "They've been around for decades.": 1,
    "Scientists use ROVs to explore the oceans.": 1,
    "Oil and gas companies use them for exploration and construction.": 1,
    "What we've built isn't unique.": 1,
    " It's how we built it that's really unique.": 1,
    "So I want to give you a quick story of how it got started.": 1,
    "So a few years ago, my friend Eric and I decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave in the foothills of the Sierras.": 1,
    " We'd heard this story about lost gold from a gold rush era robbery and we wanted to go up there.": 1,
    "Unfortunately, we didn't have any money and we didn't have any tools to do it.": 1,
    "So Eric had an initial design idea for a robot.": 1,
    " But we didn't have all the parts figured out.": 1,
    "So we did what anybody would do in our situation.": 1,
    "We asked the internet for help.": 1,
    "More specifically, we created this website, OpenROV.com, and shared our intentions and our plans.": 1,
    " For the first few months it was just Eric and I talking back to each other on the forums.": 1,
    "But pretty soon we started to get feedback from makers and hobbyists and then actually professional ocean engineers who had some suggestions for what we should do.": 1,
    " We kept working on it, we learned a lot, we kept prototyping, and eventually we decided we wanted to go to the cave.": 1,
    "We were ready.": 1,
    "So, about that time, our little expedition became quite a story and it got picked up in the New York Times.": 1,
    " And we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted a kit that they could build this OpenROV themselves.": 1,
    "So we decided to put the project on Kickstarter.": 1,
    " And when we did, we raised our funding goal in about two hours and all of a sudden had this money to make these kits.": 1,
    " But then we had to learn how to make them.": 1,
    "I mean, we had to learn small batch manufacturing.": 1,
    "So we quickly learned that our garage was not big enough to hold our growing operation.": 1,
    "But we were able to do it.": 1,
    "We got all the kits made.": 1,
    "Thanks a lot to Tech Shop, which was a big help to us.": 1,
    " And we ship these kits all over the world just before Christmas of last year.": 1,
    "So it was just a few months ago.": 1,
    "But we're already starting to get video and photos back from all over the world, including this shot from under the ice in Antarctica.": 1,
    " We've also learned that penguins love robots.": 1,
    " So we're still publishing all the designs online, encouraging anyone to build these themselves.": 1,
    "That's the only way that we could have done this.": 1,
    "It's by being open source.": 1,
    "We've created this distributed R&D network, and we're moving faster than any venture-backed counterpart.": 1,
    " But the actual robot is really only half the story.": 1,
    "The real potential, the long-term potential, is with this community of DIY ocean explorers that are forming all over the globe.": 1,
    " What can we discover when there's thousands of these devices roaming the seas?": 1,
    " So you're probably all wondering, the cave, did you find the gold?": 1,
    " Well, we didn't find any gold, but we decided that what we found was much more valuable.": 1,
    "It was this glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration.": 1,
    "It's something that's not limited to the James Cameron's of the world.": 1,
    " but something that we're all participating in.": 1,
    "It's an underwater world we're all exploring together.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
