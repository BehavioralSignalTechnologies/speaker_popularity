    " Metaphor lives a secret life all around us.": 1,
    "We utter about six metaphors a minute metaphorical thinking is essential to how we understand ourselves and others how we communicate and": 1,
    " learn, discover, and invent.": 1,
    "But metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words.": 1,
    " Now, to assist me in explaining this, I've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers, the reigning king of the metaphorians, a man whose contributions to the field are so great that he himself": 1,
    " has become a metaphor.": 1,
    "I am of course referring to none other": 1,
    " than Elvis Presley.": 1,
    " Now, All Shook Up is a great love song.": 1,
    "It's also a great example of how whenever we deal with anything abstract, ideas, emotions, feelings, concepts, thoughts, we inevitably resort to metaphor.": 1,
    "In All Shook Up,": 1,
    " A touch is not a touch, but a chill.": 1,
    " Lips are not lips, but volcanoes.": 1,
    "She is not she, but a buttercup.": 1,
    " And love is not love, but being all shook up.": 1,
    " In this, Elvis is following Aristotle's classic definition of metaphor as the process of giving the thing a name that belongs to something else.": 1,
    "This is the mathematics of metaphor.": 1,
    " And fortunately, it's very simple.": 1,
    "X equals Y.": 1,
    " This formula works wherever metaphor is present.": 1,
    "Elvis uses it, but so does Shakespeare, in his famous line from Romeo and Juliet, Juliet is the sun.": 1,
    " Now here, Shakespeare gives the thing, Juliet, a name that belongs to something else, the sun.": 1,
    " But whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else, we give it a whole network of analogies, too.": 1,
    "We mix and match what we know about the metaphor's source, in this case, the sun, with what we know about its target, Juliet.": 1,
    " And metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of Juliet than if Shakespeare had literally described what she looks like.": 1,
    " So how do we make and understand metaphors?": 1,
    "This might look familiar.": 1,
    "The first step is pattern recognition.": 1,
    "Look at this image.": 1,
    "What do you see?": 1,
    " Three-wayward Pac-Men and three pointy brackets are actually present.": 1,
    "What we see, however, are two overlapping triangles.": 1,
    "Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns, it is the creation of patterns.": 1,
    " Second step, conceptual synesthesia.": 1,
    " Now, synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in one sense organ in another sense organ as well, such as colored hearing.": 1,
    "People with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters.": 1,
    " we all have synesthetic abilities.": 1,
    "This is the Bouba-Kiki test.": 1,
    "What you have to do is identify which of these shapes is called Bouba and which is called Kiki.": 1,
    " If you're like 98% of other people, you will identify the round amoeboid shape as Booba and the sharp spiky one as Kiki.": 1,
    " Can we do a quick show of hands?": 1,
    "Does that correspond?": 1,
    " Okay, I think 99.9 would about cover it.": 1,
    " Why do we do that?": 1,
    "Because we instinctively find or create a pattern between the round shape and the round sound of booba and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of kiki.": 1,
    " And many of the metaphors we use every day are synesthetic.": 1,
    "Silence is sweet, neckties are loud, sexually attractive people are hot, sexually unattractive people leave us cold.": 1,
    " Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia in which we understand one concept in the context of another.": 1,
    " Third step is cognitive dissonance.": 1,
    "This is the stroke test.": 1,
    "What you need to do here is identify as quickly as possible the color of the ink in which these words are printed.": 1,
    "You can take the test now.": 1,
    " If you're like most people, you will experience a moment of cognitive dissonance when the name of the color is printed in a differently colored ink.": 1,
    " The test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words, even when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer.": 1,
    "Stroke tests have been done with metaphor as well, and participants had to identify as quickly as possible the literally false sentences.": 1,
    " They took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences.": 1,
    "Why?": 1,
    "Because we cannot ignore the metaphorical meaning of words either.": 1,
    "One of the sentences was, some jobs are jails.": 1,
    " Now, unless you're a prison guard, the sentence, some jobs are jails, is literally false.": 1,
    "Sadly, it's metaphorically true.": 1,
    "And the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability to identify it as literally false.": 1,
    " Metaphor matters because it's around us every day all the time.": 1,
    "Metaphor matters because it creates expectations.": 1,
    "Pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news.": 1,
    " Agent metaphors describe price movements as the deliberate action of a living thing, as in the Nasdaq climbed higher.": 1,
    "Object metaphors describe price movements as nonliving things, as in the Dow fell like a brick.": 1,
    " Researchers asked a group of people to read a clutch of market commentaries and then predict the next day's price trend.": 1,
    " Those exposed to agent metaphors had higher expectations that the price trends would continue.": 1,
    "They had those expectations because agent metaphors imply the deliberate action of a living thing pursuing a goal.": 1,
    " If, for example, house prices are routinely described as climbing and climbing, higher and higher, people might naturally assume that that rise is unstoppable.": 1,
    "They may feel confident, say, in taking out mortgages.": 1,
    "They really can't afford.": 1,
    " That's a hypothetical example, of course.": 1,
    " But this is how metaphor misleads.": 1,
    " Metaphor also matters because it influences decisions by activating analogies.": 1,
    "A group of students was told that a small democratic country had been invaded and had asked the US for help, and they had to make a decision.": 1,
    "What should they do?": 1,
    " intervene, appeal to the UN, or do nothing.": 1,
    "They were each then given one of three descriptions of this hypothetical crisis, each of which was designed to trigger a different historical analogy.": 1,
    "World War II, Vietnam,": 1,
    " and the third was historically neutral.": 1,
    "Those exposed to the World War II scenario made more interventionist recommendations than the others.": 1,
    " Just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words, we cannot ignore the analogies that are triggered by metaphor.": 1,
    " Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery.": 1,
    "Whenever we solve a problem or make a discovery, we compare what we know with what we don't know.": 1,
    "And the only way to find out about the latter is to investigate the ways it might be like the former.": 1,
    " Einstein described his scientific method as combinatorial play.": 1,
    "He famously used thought experiments, which are essentially elaborate analogies, to come up with some of his greatest discoveries.": 1,
    " By bringing together what we know and what we don't know through analogy, metaphorical thinking strikes the spark that ignites discovery.": 1,
    " Now, metaphor is ubiquitous, yet it's hidden.": 1,
    "But you just have to look at the words around you and you'll find it.": 1,
    "Ralph Waldo Emerson described language as fossil poetry.": 1,
    " But before it was fossil poetry, language was fossil metaphor.": 1,
    " and these fossils still breathe.": 1,
    " Take the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy, cogito ergo sum.": 1,
    "That's routinely translated as, I think, therefore I am.": 1,
    "But there's a better translation.": 1,
    " The Latin word cogito is derived from the prefix co meaning together and the verb agitare meaning to shake.": 1,
    "So the original meaning of cogito is to shake together.": 1,
    " And the proper translation of Kogito ergo sum is, I shake things up, therefore I am.": 1,
    " metaphor shakes things up, giving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process.": 1,
    " The mind is a plastic snow dome, most beautiful, most interesting and most itself when, as Elvis put it, it's all shook up.": 1,
    "And metaphor keeps the mind shaking, rattling and rolling long after Elvis has left the building.": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1
