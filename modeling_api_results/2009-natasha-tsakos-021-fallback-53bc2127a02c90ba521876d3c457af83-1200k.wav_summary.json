    " Thank you.": 4,
    " I love theater.": 1,
    "I love the idea that you can transform, become somebody else and look at life with a completely new perspective.": 1,
    " I love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen the idea that in that room at that moment everyone": 1,
    " regardless of their age, their gender, their race, their color, their religion, comes together.": 1,
    "At that moment, we transcend space and time together.": 1,
    " Theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination.": 1,
    "And our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers.": 1,
    "Our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique.": 1,
    " I was commissioned in 2003 to create an original show and began developing UpWake.": 1,
    " Up Week tells the story of Zero, a modern-day businessman going to work with his life in a suitcase, stuck between dream and reality, and not able to decipher the two.": 1,
    " I wanted Upwait to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would, and I wanted to let my imagination run wild.": 1,
    "So I began drawing the story that was moving in my head.": 1,
    " If Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, the author of The Little Prince, were here, he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you your sheep was inside.": 1,
    "Because if you look closely enough, things will begin to appear.": 1,
    " This is not a box.": 1,
    "These are the renderings of my imagination from head to paper to screen to life.": 1,
    " In Upwake, buildings wear suits, Zero tap dances on a giant keyboard, clones himself with a scanner, tames and whips the computer mice, sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper,": 1,
    " and launches into space.": 1,
    "I wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist, go from one world to another in a second.": 1,
    "I wanted to have humor, beauty, simplicity and complexity.": 1,
    " and use metaphors to suggest ideas.": 1,
    "At the beginning of the show, for example, Zero DJs dream and reality.": 1,
    " Technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions in high definition live on stage.": 1,
    "So today I would like to talk to you about the relationship between theater and technology.": 1,
    " Let's start with technology.": 1,
    " All right, let's start with theater.": 1,
    " Ahem.": 1,
    " Hehehe": 1,

    " Hahahaha!": 1,
    " I'm gonna do it.": 1,
    " Let's go.": 1,
    " Zzzzzz": 1,
    " Oh, thank you.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1,
    "Up wake lasts 52 minutes and 54 seconds.": 1,
    "I project 3D animation on all the four surfaces of the stage, which I interact with.": 1,
    " The use of animation and projection was a process of discovery.": 1,
    "I didn't use it as a special effect, but as a partner on stage.": 1,
    "There are no special effects in Upwake, no artifice.": 1,
    "It's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal.": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1,
    " 344 frames, four and a half years, and commissions later.": 1,
    "What started as a one person show became a collaborative work of 19 most talented artists.": 1,
    "And here are some excerpts.": 1,
    " Bye bye.": 1,
    " I'm sick and tired of all of this.": 1,
    " What is your, what is your, what is your motto here?": 1,

    "So this is relatively a new show that we're now beginning to tour in Austin, Texas.": 1,
    "I was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon.": 1,
    " When I arrived at one of the schools, I certainly did not expect this.": 1,
    "600 kids packed in a gymnasium, waiting.": 1,
    "I was a little nervous performing without animation, costume, really, and makeup.": 1,
    " But the teachers came to me afterwards and told me they hadn't seen the kids that attentive.": 1,
    "And I think the reason why is that I was able to use their language and their reality in order to transport them into another.": 1,
    " Something happened along the way.": 1,
    "Zero became a person, and not just a character in a play.": 1,
    "Zero does not speak, is neither a man nor a woman.": 1,
    "Zero is Zero, a little hero of the 21st century.": 1,
    " And Zero can touch so many more people than I possibly could.": 1,
    " It's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box as it is about taking theater out of its box.": 1,
    " As a street performer, I have learned that everybody wants to connect.": 1,
    "And that usually, if you're a bit extraordinary, if you're not exactly of human appearance, then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud.": 1,
    " It's as though you made something resonate within them.": 1,
    "It's as though the mystery of the person they're interacting with and connecting allows them to be themselves just a bit more.": 1,
    "Because through your mask, they let theirs go.": 1,
    " Being human is an art form.": 1,
    "I know theater can improve the quality of people's lives and I know theater can heal.": 1,

    " quantum physics video games, and Zero wants to go to the moon.": 1,
    "In 2007, Zero launched a green campaign suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity every Sunday from 7.53 to 8 p.m.": 1,
    " The idea is simple, basic, it's not original, but it's important and it's important to participate.": 1,
    " Oh no!": 1,
    " so": 1,
    " There is a revolution.": 1,
    "It's a human and technological revolution.": 1,
    "It's motion and emotion.": 1,
    "It's information.": 1,
    "It's visual, it's musical, it's sensorial.": 1,
    " It's conceptual, it's universal, it's beyond words and numbers, it's happening.": 1,
    "The natural progression of science and art, finding each other to better touch and define the human experience.": 1,
    " There is a revolution in the way that we think, in the way that we share, and in the way that we express our stories, our evolution.": 1,
    " This is a time of communication, connection, and creative collaboration.": 1,
