    " What's in the box?": 2,
    " Whatever it is, it must be pretty important because I've traveled with it, moved it from apartment to apartment to apartment.": 1,
    " Sound familiar?": 1,
    "Did you know that we Americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago?": 1,
    "Three times.": 1,
    " So you'd think with all this extra space, we'd have plenty of room for all our stuff, right?": 1,
    "Nope.": 1,
    " There's a new industry in town, a $22 billion, 2.2 billion square foot industry without a personal storage.": 1,
    "So we've got triple the space, but we've become such good shoppers that we need even more space.": 1,
    " So where does this lead?": 1,
    "Lots of credit card debt.": 1,
    " Huge environmental footprints, and perhaps not coincidentally, are happiness levels flatlined over the same 50 years.": 1,
    "Well, I'm here to suggest there's a better way, that less might actually equal more.": 1,
    " I bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less.": 1,
    " College, your dorm, traveling in a hotel room, camping where you got basically nothing, maybe a boat.": 1,
    "Whatever it was for you, I bet that among other things, this gave you a little more freedom.": 1,
    " a little more time.": 1,
    " So I want to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal smaller footprint.": 1,
    "It's actually a great way to save you some money and it's going to give you a little more ease in your life.": 1,
    " So I started a project called LifeEdited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area.": 1,
    " First up, crowdsourcing my 420-square-foot apartment in Manhattan with partners Mutopo and Juvoto.com.": 1,
    "I wanted it all.": 1,
    "Home office, sit-down dinner for 10,": 1,
    " room for guests, and all my kitesurfing gear.": 1,
    "With over 300 entries from around the world, I got it, my own little jewel box.": 1,
    "By buying a space that was 420 square feet instead of 600,": 1,
    " immediately I'm saving 200 grand.": 1,
    "Smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities, save some more money there, but also a smaller footprint.": 1,
    " And because it's really designed around an edited set of possessions, my favorite stuff, and really designed for me, I'm really excited to be there.": 1,
    "So how can you live little?": 1,
    "Three main approaches.": 1,
    " First of all, you need to edit ruthlessly.": 1,
    "We've got to clear the arteries of our lives.": 1,
    "That shirt that I haven't worn in years?": 1,
    " It's time for me to let it go.": 1,
    "We've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives, and we've got to learn to stem the inflow.": 1,
    "We need to think before we buy.": 1,
    "Ask ourselves, is that really going to make me happier, truly?": 1,
    " By all means, we should buy and own some great stuff.": 1,
    "But we want stuff that we're going to love for years, not just stuff.": 1,
    " Secondly, our new mantra, small is sexy.": 1,
    "We want space efficiency.": 1,
    "We want things that are designed for how they're used the vast majority of the time, not that rare event.": 1,
    " Why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three?": 1,
    "So we want things that nest, we want things that stack, and we want to digitize.": 1,
    "You can take paperwork, books, movies,": 1,
    " and you can make it disappear.": 1,
    "It's magic.": 1,
    "Finally, we want multifunctional spaces and housewares.": 1,
    "A sink's combined with a toilet.": 1,
    "A dining table becomes a bed.": 1,
    "Same space.": 1,
    " A little side table stretches out to seat 10.": 1,
    "In the winning life-edited scheme in a render here, we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space.": 1,
    "Look at the coffee table.": 1,
    " It grows in height and width to seat 10.": 1,
    "My office folds away, easily hidden.": 1,
    "My bed pops out of the wall, two fingers.": 1,
    " guests, move the moving wall, have some fold-down guest beds, and of course, my own movie theater.": 1,
    "So I'm not saying that we all need to live in 420 square feet, but consider the benefits of an edited life.": 1,
    " go from 3,000 to 2,000, from 1,500 to 1,000.": 1,
    "Most of us, maybe all of us, are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with couple bags, maybe small space, hotel room.": 1,
    " So when you go home and you walk through your front door, take a second and ask yourselves, could I do with a little life editing?": 1,
    "Would that give me a little more freedom, maybe a little more time?": 1,
    " It doesn't really matter.": 1,
    " I know I don't need it.": 1,
    " What's in yours?": 1,
    "Maybe, just maybe, less might equal more.": 1,
    " So let's make room for the good stuff.": 1,
    " Thank you.": 1
