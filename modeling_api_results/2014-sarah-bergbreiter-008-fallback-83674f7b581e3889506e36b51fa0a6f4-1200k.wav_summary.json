    " My students and I work on very tiny robots.": 1,
    "Now, you can think of these as robotic versions of something that you're all very familiar with, an ant.": 1,
    " We all know that ants and other insects at this size scale can do some pretty incredible things.": 1,
    "We've all seen a group of ants or some version of that carting off your potato chip at a picnic, for example.": 1,
    " But what are the real challenges of engineering these ants?": 1,
    "Well, first of all, how do we kit the capabilities of an ant and a robot at the same size scale?": 1,
    "Well, first we need to figure out how to make them move when they're so small.": 1,
    " We need mechanisms like legs and efficient motors in order to support that locomotion, and we need the sensors' power and control in order to pull everything together in a semi-intelligent ant robot.": 1,
    " Finally, to make these things really functional, we want a lot of them working together in order to do bigger things.": 1,
    " So I'll start with mobility.": 1,
    "Insects move around amazingly well.": 1,
    "This video is from UC Berkeley.": 1,
    "It shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain without tipping over.": 1,
    " And it's able to do this because its legs are a combination of rigid materials, which is what we traditionally use to make robots, and soft materials.": 1,
    " Jumping is another really interesting way to get around when you're very small.": 1,
    "So these insects store energy in a spring and release that really quickly to get the high power they need to jump out of water, for example.": 1,
    " So one of the big contributions from my lab has been to combine rigid and soft materials in very, very small mechanisms.": 1,
    " So this jumping mechanism is about four millimeters on a side, so really tiny.": 1,
    "The hard material here is silicon and the soft material is silicone rubber.": 1,
    " And the basic idea is that we're going to compress this, store energy in the springs, and then release it to jump.": 1,
    "So there's no motors on board this right now, no power.": 1,
    "This is actuated with a method that we call in my lab, graduate student with tweezers.": 1,
    " So what you'll see in the next video is this guy doing amazingly well for its jumps.": 1,
    "So this is Aaron, the graduate student in question with the tweezers, and what you see is this four millimeter size mechanism jumping almost 40 centimeters high.": 1,
    "That's almost a hundred times its own length.": 1,
    " It survives bounces on the table.": 1,
    "It's incredibly robust and of course survives quite well until we lose it because it's very tiny.": 1,
    " Ultimately, though, we want to add motors to this, too.": 1,
    "And we have students in the lab working on millimeter-sized motors to eventually integrate onto small, autonomous robots.": 1,
    " But in order to look at mobility and locomotion at this size scale to start, we're cheating in using magnets.": 1,
    "So this shows what would eventually be part of a micro robot leg, and you can see the silicone rubber joints, and there's an embedded magnet that's being moved around by an external magnetic field.": 1,
    " So this leads to the robot that I showed you earlier.": 1,
    " The really interesting thing that this robot can help us figure out is how insects move at this scale.": 1,
    "We have a really good model for how everything from a cockroach up to an elephant moves.": 1,
    "We all move in this kind of bouncy way when we run.": 1,
    " But when I'm really small, my feet, the forces between my feet and the ground are going to affect my locomotion a lot more than my mass, which is what causes that bouncy motion.": 1,
    " So this guy doesn't work quite yet, but we do have slightly larger versions that do run around.": 1,
    "So this is about a centimeter cubed on a centimeter on a side, so very tiny.": 1,
    " And we've gotten this to run about 10 body lengths per second, so 10 centimetres per second, so pretty quick for a little small guy, and that's really only limited by our test setup.": 1,
    "But this gives you some idea of how it works right now.": 1,
    " We can also make 3D printed versions of this that can climb over obstacles a lot like the cockroach that you saw earlier.": 1,
    " But ultimately, we want to add everything on board the robot.": 1,
    "We want sensing, power, control, actuation all together.": 1,
    "And not everything needs to be bio-inspired.": 1,
    "So this robot is about the size of a TikTok.": 1,
    " In this case, instead of magnets or muscles to move this around, we use rockets.": 1,
    "This is a microfabricated energetic material.": 1,
    "We can create tiny pixels of this.": 1,
    " And we can put one of these pixels on the belly of this robot.": 1,
    "And this robot then is going to jump when it senses an increase in light.": 1,
    " The next video is one of my favourites.": 1,
    "You have this 300mg robot jumping about 8cm in the air.": 1,
    "It's only 4x4x7mm in size.": 1,
    " And you'll see a big flash at the beginning when the energetic is set off and the robot tumbling through the air.": 1,
    "So there is that big flash, and you can see the robot jumping up through the air.": 1,
    " So there's no tethers on this, no wires connecting to this, everything is on board, and it jumped in response to the student just flicking on a desk lamp next to it.": 1,
    " So I think you can imagine all those kind of cool things that we could do with robots that can run and crawl and jump and roll at this size scale.": 1,
    "Imagine the rubble that you get after a natural disaster like an earthquake.": 1,
    "Imagine these small robots running through that rubble to look for": 1,
    " survivors.": 1,
    "Or imagine a lot of small robots running around a bridge in order to inspect it and make sure it's safe so you don't get collapses like this that happened outside of Minneapolis in 2007.": 1,
    " Or just imagine what you could do if you had robots that could swim through your blood, right?": 1,
    "Fantastic Voyage, Isaac Asimov, or they could operate without having to cut you open in the first place.": 1,
    " Or we could radically change the way we build things if we have our tiny robots work the same way that termites do.": 1,
    "And they build these incredible eight-meter-high mounds, effectively well-ventilated apartment buildings for other termites in Africa and Australia.": 1,
    " So I think I've given you some of the possibilities of what we can do with these small robots.": 1,
    "And hopefully we've made some advances so far, but there's still a long way to go.": 1,
    "And hopefully some of you can contribute to that destination.": 1,
    "Thanks very much.": 1
