    " My big idea is a very, very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas.": 1,
    " that are at the moment dormant inside us.": 1,
    "And my little idea that will do that is sleep.": 1,
    " This is a room of type A women.": 1,
    " This is a room of sleep deprived women.": 1,
    "And I learned the hard way the value of sleep.": 1,
    " Two and a half years ago, I fainted from exhaustion.": 1,
    "I hit my head on my desk, I broke my cheekbone, I got five stitches on my right eye.": 1,
    "And I began the journey of rediscovering the valley of sleep.": 1,
    " And in the course of that, I studied, I met with medical doctors, scientists, and I'm here to tell you that the way to a more productive, more inspired, more joyful life is getting enough sleep.": 1,
    " And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution, this new feminist issue.": 1,
    "We are literally going to slip our way to the top.": 1,
    "Literally.": 1,
    " Because unfortunately for men, sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol.": 1,
    " I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before.": 1,
    "And I felt like saying to him, but I didn't say it, I felt like saying, you know what, if you had gotten five, this dinner would have been a lot more interesting.": 1,
    " There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship.": 1,
    "Especially here in Washington, if you try to make a breakfast date and you say, how about 8 o'clock?": 1,
    " They're likely to tell you, eight o'clock is too late for me, but that's okay, you know, I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight.": 1,
    "And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive, but the truth is they're not.": 1,
    " because we at the moment have had brilliant leaders in business, in finance, in politics, making terrible decisions.": 1,
    " So a high IQ does not mean that you're a good leader, because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic.": 1,
    " And we've had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanic.": 1,
    "In fact, I have a feeling that the Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters.": 1,
    "They might still be around.": 1,
    " While all the brothers were busy, you know, just being hyper-connected 24-7, maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg because she would have woken up from a seven and a half or eight hour sleep.": 1,
    " and have been able to see the big picture.": 1,
    " So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment, what is good for us on a personal level?": 1,
    "What's going to bring more joy, gratitude?": 1,
    " effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world.": 1,
    "So I urge you": 1,
    " to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us, to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
