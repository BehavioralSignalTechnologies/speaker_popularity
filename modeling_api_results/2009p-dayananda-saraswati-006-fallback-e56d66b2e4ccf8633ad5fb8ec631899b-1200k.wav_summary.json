    " that the person trusted.": 1,
    " is violating the trust.": 1,
    "It doesn't know even the word violation.": 1,

    " One feels I have enough.": 1,
    " To be compassionate is not a joke.": 1,
    " is not that simple.": 1,
    " One has to discover.": 1,
    " a certain bigness in oneself.": 1,
    " That bigness should be centered on oneself, not in terms of money.": 1,
    " not in terms of power you wield.": 1,
    " not in terms of any status that you can command in the society.": 1,

    " Yempati.": 1,

    " No religion can demolish that by indoctrination.": 1,
    " no culture, no nation and nationalism.": 1,
    " Nothing can touch it.": 1,
    " because it is empathy.": 1,
    " And that...": 1,

    "Because": 1,
    " It is there in everybody.": 1,
    " It's experienced by people.": 1,
    " Occasionally": 1,
    " then this occasional compassion": 1,
    " we are not talking about.": 1,
    " It will ever remain occasional.": 1,
    " By mandate, you cannot make a person compassionate.": 1,
    " You can't say, please love me.": 1,
    " Love is something you discover.": 1,
    " It's not an action.": 1,
    " But in English language, it is also an action.": 1,
    " I will come to it later.": 1,
    " So one has got to discover a certain wholeness.": 1,
    " I am going to cite the possibility of being whole.": 1,
    " which is within our experience, everybody's experience.": 1,
    " in spite of her.": 1,
    " a very tragic life.": 1,
    " One is happy": 1,
    " in moments which are very few and far between.": 1,
    " and the one who is happy.": 1,

    " accepts himself.": 1,
    " and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself.": 1,
    " That means the whole universe.": 1,
    " known things and unknown things.": 1,
    " All of them are totally accepted.": 1,
    " because you discover your wholeness in yourself.": 1,
    " The subject, me,": 1,
    " And the object, the scheme of things, fuse.": 1,
    " into oneness.": 1,
    " An experience nobody can say, I am denied of.": 1,
    " An experience common to all and sundry.": 1,
    " That experience confirms": 1,
    " that in spite of all your limitations,": 1,
    " All your wants, desires, unfulfilled and the credit cards.": 1,
    " and layoffs.": 1,
    " And finally, baldness.": 1,
    " You can be happy.": 1,
    " The extension of the logic is": 1,
    " that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy.": 1,
    " You are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be.": 1,
    " There is no choice in this.": 1,
    "That only confirms the reality.": 1,
    " that the wholeness cannot": 1,
    " Be different from you.": 1,
    " cannot be minus U.": 1,
    " It has got to be you.": 1,
    "You cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole.": 1,
    " A moment of happiness reveals that reality, that realization, that recognition.": 1,
    " Maybe I am the whole.": 1,
    "You start a new life.": 1,
    " then everything becomes meaningful.": 1,
    " I have no more reason to blame myself.": 1,

    " is white it is not black.": 1,
    " Body is limited, any which way you look at it, limited.": 1,
    " Your knowledge is limited, health is limited.": 1,
    " and powers therefore limited and the cheerfulness is going to be limited.": 1,
    " Compassion is going to be limited.": 1,
    " Everything is going to be limitless.": 1,
    "You cannot command compassion.": 1,
    " Unless you become limitless and nobody can become limitless, either you are or you are not.": 1,
    "Period.": 1,
    " And there is no way of your being not limitless too.": 1,
    " Your own experience reveals.": 1,
    " In spite of all limitations, you are the whole.": 1,
    " and the wholeness is the reality of you.": 1,
    " When you relate to the world, it is love first.": 1,
    " When you relate to the world, the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is what we say.": 1,
    " low.": 1,
    " and itself becomes compassion.": 1,
    " If the object that you relate to": 1,
    " your books.": 1,
    " that emotion.": 1,
    " then that again transforms into...": 1,
    " into giving, into sharing.": 1,
    " You express yourself because you have compassion.": 1,
    " To discover compassion, you need to be compassionate.": 1,
    " To discover the capacity to give and share, you need to be giving and sharing.": 1,
    "There is no shortcut.": 1,
    "It is like swimming by swimming.": 1,
    "You learn swimming by swimming.": 1,
    " You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water.": 1,
    " You learn swimming by swimming, you learn cycling by cycling, you learn cooking by cooking, having some sympathetic people around you.": 1,
    " To eat, what do you cook?": 1,
    " and therefore what I say.": 1,
    " You have to fake it and make it.": 1,
    " you need to": 1,
    " My predecessor meant that.": 1,
    " You have to act it out.": 1,
    " You have to act.": 1,
    " compassionately.": 1,
    " There is no verb for compassion.": 1,
    " But you have an adverb for compassion.": 1,
    " That's interesting to me.": 1,
    " You act compassionately.": 1,
    " But then how to act compassionately if I don't have compassion?": 1,
    "That is where you fake.": 1,
    "This is the mantra of United States of America.": 1,
    " You act compassionately as though you have compassion.": 1,
    "Grind your teeth.": 1,
    " Take all the support system.": 1,
