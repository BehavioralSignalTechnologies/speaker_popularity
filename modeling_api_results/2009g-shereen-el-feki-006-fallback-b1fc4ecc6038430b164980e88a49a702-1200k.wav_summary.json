    " Hello everyone.": 1,
    "Because this is my first time at TED, I've decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit.": 1,
    " Yes, that's right, this is Barbie.": 1,
    "She's 50 years old and she's looking as young as ever.": 1,
    " but I'd also like to introduce you to what may be an unfamiliar face.": 1,
    " This is Fullah.": 1,
    "Fullah is the Arab world's answer to Barbie.": 1,
    " Now according to proponents of the clash of civilizations, Barbie and Fula occupy these completely separate spheres.": 1,
    "They have different interests, they have divergent values, and should they ever come in contact,": 1,
    " Well, I gotta tell you, it's just not gonna be pretty.": 1,
    " My experience, however, in the Islamic world is very different.": 1,
    "Where I work, in the Arab region, people are busy taking up Western innovations and changing them into things which are neither conventionally Western nor are they traditionally Islamic.": 1,
    " I want to show you two examples.": 1,
    "The first is for Shabab.": 1,
    "It means for youth, and it's a new Arab TV channel.": 1,
    " video clips from across the globe.": 1,
    "The USA.": 1,
    " The L-Wolf.": 1,
    " Qad sanaha sanaha tohr al hijab Qad sanaha sanaha noor al kitab": 1,
    " For Shabaab has been dubbed Islamic MTV.": 1,
    "Its creator, who's an Egyptian TV producer called Ahmed Abu Haba, wants young people to be inspired by Islam to lead better lives.": 1,
    " He reckons the best way to get that message across is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos.": 1,
    "4Shabab was set up as an alternative to existing Arab music channels, and they look something like this.": 1,
    " That, by the way, is Haifa Wahbi.": 1,
    "She's a Lebanese pop star and pan-Arab pin-up girl.": 1,
    " In the world of four shabab, it's not about bump and grind, but it's not about fire and brimstone either.": 1,
    "Its videos are intended to show a kinder, gentler face of Islam for young people to deal with life's challenges.": 1,
    " Now my second example is for a slightly younger crowd, and it's called the 99.": 1,
    " Now these are the world's first Islamic superheroes.": 1,
    "They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist called Nayef al-Muttawa, and his desire is to rescue Islam from images of intolerance, all in a child-friendly format.": 1,
    " The 99, the characters are meant to embody the 99 attributes of Allah.": 1,
    "Justice, wisdom, mercy among others.": 1,
    " So, for example, there is the character of Nora.": 1,
    "She is meant to have the power to look inside people and see the good and bad in everyone.": 1,
    " Another character called Jami has the ability to create fantastic inventions.": 1,
    " Now, the 99 is not just a comic book.": 1,
    "It's now a theme park.": 1,
    "There's an animated series in the works.": 1,
    "And by this time next year, the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman will have joined forces with the 99 to beat injustice wherever they find it.": 1,
    " The 99 and 4 Shabab are just two of many examples of this sort of Islamic cross-cultural hybridization.": 1,
    " We're not talking here about a clash of civilizations, nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash.": 1,
    "I like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined.": 1,
    " Now, while four Shabab and the 99 may look new and shiny, there's actually a very long tradition of this.": 1,
    "Throughout its history, Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations, both ancient and modern.": 1,
    " After all, it's the Quran which encourages us to do this.": 1,
    " We made you into nations and tribes so that you could learn from one another.": 1,
    "And to my mind, those are pretty wise words, no matter what your creed.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
