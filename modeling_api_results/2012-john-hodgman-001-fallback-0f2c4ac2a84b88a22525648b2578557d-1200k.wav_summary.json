    " Today I'm going to unpack for you three examples of iconic design and it makes perfect sense that I should be the one to do it because I have a bachelor's degree in literature.": 1,
    " But I'm also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of design within reach catalogs, so...": 1,
    " I pretty much know everything there is.": 1,
    "Now, I'm sure you recognize this object.": 1,
    "Many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at Los Angeles International Airport over the past couple of days.": 1,
    " This is known as the theme building.": 1,
    "That is its name for reasons that are still very murky.": 1,
    " And it is perhaps the best example we have in Los Angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture.": 1,
    " It was first excavated in 1961 as they were building LAX, although scientists believe that it dates back to the year 2000 before Common Era, when it was used as a busy trans-dimensional spaceport.": 1,
    " by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants.": 1,
    " It is thought to have been a replacement for the older spaceport located, of course, at Stonehenge.": 1,
    " and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design, the lack of druids hanging around all the time, and obviously the much better access to parking.": 1,
    "When it was uncovered,": 1,
    " It ushered in a new era of streamlined, archaically futuristic design called Googie, which came to be synonymous with the Jet Age, a misnomer.": 1,
    " After all, the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often, preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls.": 1,
    " Ah, yes.": 1,
    " A table.": 1,
    "We use these every day.": 1,
    "And on top of it, the Juicy Salif.": 1,
    "This is a design by Philippe Starck, who I believe is in the audience at this very moment.": 1,
    "And you can tell it is a stark design by its precision.": 1,
    " its playfulness, its innovation, and its promise of imminent violence.": 1,
    " It is a design that challenges your intuition.": 1,
    "It is not what you think it is when you first see it.": 1,
    "It is not a fork designed to grab three hors d'oeuvres at a time.": 1,
    " which would be useful out in the lobby, I would say.": 1,
    "And despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts in its space aginess and tripodism, it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts.": 1,
    " It is, in fact, a citrus juicer, and when I say that, you never see it as anything else again.": 1,
    "It is also not": 1,
    " a monument to design.": 1,
    "It is a monument to design's utility.": 1,
    "You can take it home with you, unlike the theme building, which will stay where it is forever.": 1,
    " This is affordable and can come home with you.": 1,
    "And as such, it can sit on your kitchen counter.": 1,
    "It can't go in your drawers.": 1,
    "Trust me, I found that out the hard way.": 1,
    " and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design.": 1,
    "One other thing about it, if you do have one at home, let me tell you one of the features you may not know.": 1,
    "When you fall asleep, it comes alive.": 1,
    " and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep.": 1,
    " Okay.": 1,
    "What?": 1,
    " is this object.": 1,
    " I have no idea.": 1,
    "I don't know what that thing is.": 1,
    "It looks terrible.": 1,
    "Is it a little hot plate?": 1,
    " Does anyone know Chi?": 1,
    "iPhone, iPhone.": 1,
    "Oh yes, that's right, I remember those.": 1,
    "I had my whole bathroom tiles redone with those back in the good old days.": 1,
    " No, I have an iPhone.": 1,
    "Of course, I do.": 1,
    "Here is my well-loved iPhone.": 1,
    "I do so many things on this little device.": 1,
    "I like to read books on it.": 1,
    "More than that, I like to buy books on it.": 1,
    " that I never have to feel guilty about not reading because they go in here and I never look at them again and it's perfect.": 1,
    " I use it every day to measure the weight of an ox for example.": 1,
    " Every now and then I admit that I complete a phone call on it occasionally.": 1,
    "And yet I forget about it all the time.": 1,
    "This is design that once you saw it, you forgot about it.": 1,
    "It is easy to forget.": 1,
    " the gasp inducement that occurred in 2007 when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly": 1,
    " We adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life.": 1,
    "Unlike...": 1,
    " the theme building this is not alien technology or I should say what it did was it took technology which unlike people in this room to many other people in the world still feels very alien.": 1,
    " and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate.": 1,
    "And unlike the juiciest leaf, it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain.": 1,
    "Rather, it simply attaches itself to your brain.": 1,
    " And you didn't even notice it happened.": 1,
    "So there you go.": 1,
    "My name is John Hodgman.": 1,
    "I just explained design.": 1,
    " Thank you very much.": 1
