    "Yeah.": 2,
    " My name is Ursus Wehrle and I would like to talk to you this morning about my project Tidying Up Art.": 1,
    "First of all, any questions so far?": 1,
    " First of all, I have to say I'm not from around here.": 1,
    "I'm from a completely different cultural area.": 1,
    "Maybe you noticed.": 1,
    "I mean, I'm wearing a tie first.": 1,
    "And secondly, I'm a little bit nervous because I'm speaking": 1,
    " in a foreign language now and I want to apologize in advance for any mistakes I might make because I'm from Switzerland and I just don't hope you think this is Swiss German I'm speaking now here.": 1,
    "This is just what it sounds like if we Swiss try to speak American.": 1,
    " But don't worry, I don't have trouble with English as such.": 1,
    "I mean, it's not my problem, it's your language after all.": 1,
    " I am fine.": 1,
    "After this presentation here at TED, I can simply go back to Switzerland and you have to go on talking like this all the time.": 1,
    " I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book.": 1,
    "It's called Tidying Up Art and it's, as you can see, it's more or less a picture book.": 1,
    " So the reading would be over very quickly.": 1,
    "But since I'm here at TED, I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way.": 1,
    " in the spirit of Ted here, and I managed to do some slides here for you.": 1,
    "I'd like to show them around so we can just, you know, yeah.": 1,
    " Actually, I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures, even better.": 1,
    "So, tidying up art, I mean, I have to say, that's a relatively new term.": 1,
    "You won't be familiar with it.": 1,
    " It's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years, and it all started out with this picture of the American artist Donald Backler I had hanging at home.": 1,
    " I had to look at it every day and after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long.": 1,
    " Yeah, I kind of felt sorry for him.": 1,
    "And it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day.": 1,
    "So I decided to give him a little support.": 1,
    " and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other.": 1,
    " Yeah, and I think he looks now less miserable.": 1,
    "With this experience, I started to look more closely at modern art.": 1,
    "And I realized how, you know,": 1,
    " The world of modern art is particularly topsy-turvy.": 1,
    "And I can just show here a very good example.": 1,
    "It's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with.": 1,
    "It's a picture by Paul Klee.": 1,
    "And we can see here very clearly, it's a confusion of color.": 1,
    " Yeah deep.": 1,
    " Yeah, the artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors, the various pictures here of the various elements of the picture.": 1,
    "The whole thing is unstructured.": 1,
    "We don't know.": 1,
    "Mr. Clay was probably in a hurry.": 1,
    " Maybe he had to catch a plane or something.": 1,
    "We can see here he started out with orange, and then he already ran out of orange.": 1,
    " Here we can see he decided to take a break for a square.": 1,
    "And I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture.": 1,
    " And we can see now what was barely recognizable in the original.": 1,
    "17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares.": 1,
    "Yeah, that's great.": 1,
    " That's just tidying up for beginners.": 1,
    "I would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced.": 1,
    " Um.": 1,
    " But can you say, what a mess?": 1,
    "I mean, everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space.": 1,
    " If my room back home had looked like this, my mother would have grounded me for three days.": 1,
    "So I'd like to, I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture.": 1,
    " And yeah, that's really advanced tidings up.": 1,
    "Yeah, you're right, sometimes people clap at this point, but that's actually more in Switzerland.": 1,
    " Yeah, you know": 1,
    " Yeah, we Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese.": 1,
    "Our trains run on time.": 1,
    "We are only happy when things are in order.": 1,
    "But to go on.": 1,
    " Here is a very good example to see.": 1,
    "This is a picture by Juan Mir\u00f3.": 1,
    "And yeah, we can see here the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background.": 1,
    " And yeah, it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone.": 1,
    " Sound hits my thumb.": 1,
    " You can see now the whole thing takes up far less space.": 1,
    "It's more economical and also more efficient.": 1,
    "I mean, with this method, Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture.": 1,
    " But I can see in your faces that you're still a little bit skeptical.": 1,
    "So that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this.": 1,
    "I brought along the patent specifications for some of these works.": 1,
    " Because I've had my working methods patented at the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Amt f\u00fcr Geistiges Eigentum in Bern, Switzerland.": 1,
    " I'll just quote from the specification.": 1,
    " It's not finished yet.": 1,
    " which will enable the art to achieve new effects through specifically organized regularities of the general form treasure.": 1,
    " Well, I could have translated that, but you would have been on the wiser.": 1,
    "I'm not sure myself what it means, but it sounds good anyway.": 1,
    " I just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people.": 1,
    "That's why these patents are sometimes necessary.": 1,
    "I would like to do a short test with you.": 1,
    "Everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning.": 1,
    "So I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand.": 1,
    " hand.": 1,
    "The right hand is the one we write with apart from the left handers.": 1,
    "Now, I'll count to three.": 1,
    "It still looks very orderly to me.": 1,
    "I'll count to three, and on the count of three,": 1,
    " I'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you, okay?": 1,
    "One, two, three.": 1,
    " Wow.": 1,
    " Yeah, you can see now, it's a good example, even behaving in an orderly systematic way can sometimes lead to complete chaos.": 1,
    " Yeah, but we can also see that very clearly in this next painting.": 1,
    "This is a painting by the artist Niki de Saint-Faul.": 1,
    "And I mean, in the original it's completely unclear.": 1,
    " to see what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict.": 1,
    "But in the tidied up version, it's plain to see that it's a sunburned woman playing volleyball.": 1,
    " Yeah, it's, but actually.": 1,
    " Yeah, this one here.": 1,
    "That's much better.": 1,
    "That's a picture by Keith Haring.": 1,
    " I think it doesn't matter.": 1,
    "So I mean, this picture has not even got a proper title.": 1,
    "It's called Untitled.": 1,
    " And I think that's appropriate.": 1,
    "So in the tidied up version, we have a sort of Keith Haring spare part shop.": 1,
    " This is Keith Herring looked at statistically.": 1,
    "One can see here quite clearly, you can see here we have 25 pale green elements.": 1,
    " of which one is in the form of a circle, or here, for example, we have 27 pink squares but only one pink curve.": 1,
    "I mean, that's interesting.": 1,
    "One could extend this sort of statistical analysis to cover all Mr. Herring's various works.": 1,
    " in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares.": 1,
    "The artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he's likely to need in the future.": 1,
    " And one can obviously also make combinations.": 1,
    "For example, with the keys herring circles and Kandinsky's dots.": 1,
    "You can add them to all the": 1,
    " squares of Paul Klee.": 1,
    "In the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange, then you categorize it, then you file it, put that file in the filing cabinet, put it in your office.": 1,
    " and you can make a living doing it.": 1,
    " Yeah, from my own experience.": 1,
    " Actually, I mean, here we have some artists that are a bit more structured.": 1,
    "It's not too bad.": 1,
    "This is Jasper Jones.": 1,
    "We can see here he was practicing with his ruler.": 1,
    " But I think it could still benefit from more discipline.": 1,
    "And I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this.": 1,
    " And here, that's one of my favorites.": 1,
    "Tidying up Rene Marguerite, this is really fun.": 1,
    " I'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this.": 1,
    "It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels.": 1,
    "So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy five-star hotel and, you know,": 1,
    " There you had this little sign.": 1,
    "I put this little sign outside the outside door every morning that read, please tidy room.": 1,
    "I don't know if you have them over here.": 1,
    " So actually, my room there hasn't been tidied once daily, but three times a day.": 1,
    "So after a while, I decided to have a little fun.": 1,
    " And before leaving the room each day, I'd scatter a few things around the space, like books, clothes, toothbrush, et cetera.": 1,
    "By the time I returned, everything had always been neatly returned to its place.": 1,
    " And then one morning I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh.": 1,
    " And you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since AD88.": 1,
    " So, and when I returned, it looked like this.": 1,
    " At least it's now possible to do some vacuuming.": 1,
    " Okay, I mean, there are always, I can see there are always people that like reacting that one or another picture hasn't been properly tidied up.": 1,
    "So we can make a short test with you.": 1,
    "This is a picture by Rene Magritte and I'd like you all": 1,
    " too inwardly, like in your head, that is, to tidy that up.": 1,
    "So it's possible that some of you would make it like this.": 1,
    " I would actually prefer to do it more this way.": 1,
    " Some people would make apple pie out of it.": 1,
    "But it's a very good example to see that the whole work was more of a handicraft endeavor that involved a very time-consuming job.": 1,
    " of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in your arrangements.": 1,
    "And it's not done, as many people imagine, with the computer.": 1,
    "Otherwise...": 1,
    " It would look like this.": 1,
    " So.": 1,
    " Now I've been able to tidy up pictures that I wanted to tidy up for a long time.": 1,
    "Here, a very good example.": 1,
    "Here, Jackson Pollock, for example.": 1,
    "Yeah, that's a really hard one.": 1,
    " But after a while, I just decided here to go all the way and just put the paint back into the cans.": 1,
    " Oh!": 1,
    " Or you could go into a three-dimensional art.": 1,
    "Here we have the Fur Cup by Merritt Oppenheim.": 1,
    "Here I just brought it back to its original state.": 1,
    " But, um, yep.": 1,
    " And it's great, you can even go, you know, or we have this pointillism movement for those of you who are like into arts.": 1,
    "Pointillism movement is that kind of paintings where everything is broken down into dots and pixels.": 1,
    " And this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up.": 1,
    " I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method, George Saron, and I collected together all his thoughts.": 1,
    "And now they're all in here.": 1,
    "You can count them afterwards if you like.": 1,
    "And here, yeah, you see, that's the wonderful thing about the tidy-up-art idea.": 1,
    "It's new.": 1,
    "So there is no existing tradition on it.": 1,
    "There is no textbooks.": 1,
    "And, I mean, not": 1,
    " Not yet, anyway.": 1,
    "I mean, it's the future we will create.": 1,
    " But to round things up, I would like to show you just one more.": 1,
    "This is the Village Square by Peter Bruegel.": 1,
    "That's how it looks like when you send everyone home.": 1,
    " Right then.": 1,
    " Yeah, maybe you're asking yourselves where all Bruegel's people went.": 1,
    "Of course, they're not gone.": 1,
    "No, they're all here.": 1,
    "Yeah, just pile them up.": 1,
    " So yeah, actually, I'm kind of finished at that moment.": 1,
    "And for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop.": 1,
    "And I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist.": 1,
    " But before leaving, I would like to show you I'm working right now on another, in a related field with my tidying up art method.": 1,
    "I'm working in a related field.": 1,
    "And I started to bring up": 1,
    " to bring some order into some flags.": 1,
    " And yeah, I am.": 1,
    " Yeah, here, that's my new proposal here for the union check.": 1,
    " And then maybe before before I leave you.": 1,
    " I think after you have seen that, I have to leave anyway.": 1,
    " Yeah, that was a hard one.": 1,
    "I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly, so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
