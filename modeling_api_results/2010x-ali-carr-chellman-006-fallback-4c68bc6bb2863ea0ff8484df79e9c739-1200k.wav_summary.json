    " So I'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys.": 1,
    "And it's a serious problem with boys.": 1,
    "Their culture isn't working in schools.": 1,
    "And I'm going to share with you ways that we can think about overcoming that problem.": 1,
    " First I want to start by saying this is a boy.": 1,
    "And this is a girl.": 1,
    "And this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl.": 1,
    " If I essentialize gender for you today, then you can dismiss what I have to say.": 1,
    "So I'm not going to do that.": 1,
    "I'm not interested in doing that.": 1,
    "This is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl, right?": 1,
    " So the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls.": 1,
    "And not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries of what we think of as girls.": 1,
    "But, in fact,": 1,
    " Most boys tend to be a certain way and most girls tend to be a certain way.": 1,
    " And the point is that for boys, the way that they exist and the culture that they embrace isn't working well in schools now.": 1,
    "How do we know that?": 1,
    "The 100 Girls Project tells us some really nice statistics.": 1,
    " For example, for every 100 girls that are suspended from school, there are 250 boys that are suspended from school.": 1,
    "For every 100 girls who are expelled from school, there are 335 boys who are expelled from school.": 1,
    " For every 100 girls in special education, there are 217 boys.": 1,
    "For every 100 girls with a learning disability, there are 276 boys.": 1,
    " For every 100 girls with an emotional disturbance diagnosed, we have 324 boys.": 1,
    "And by the way, all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black, if you happen to be poor.": 1,
    " if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school.": 1,
    "And if you are a boy, you're four times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.": 1,
    " Now, there is another side to this, and it is important that we recognize that women still need help in school.": 1,
    " that salaries are still significantly lower even when controlled for job types, and that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years.": 1,
    " That's all true.": 1,
    "Nothing about that prevents us from paying attention to the literacy needs of our boys between ages 3 and 13.": 1,
    " And so we should.": 1,
    "In fact, what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook because the initiatives and programs that have been set in place for women in science and engineering and mathematics are fantastic.": 1,
    "They've done a lot of good.": 1,
    " for girls in these situations.": 1,
    "And we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too, in their younger years.": 1,
    " Even in their older years, what we find is that there's still a problem.": 1,
    "When we look at the university, 60% of baccalaureate degrees are going to women now.": 1,
    " which is a significant shift.": 1,
    "And in fact, university administrators are a little uncomfortable about the idea that we may be getting close to 70% female population in universities.": 1,
    " This makes university administrators very nervous because girls don't want to go to schools that don't have boys.": 1,
    " And so, we're starting to see the establishment of men's centers and men's studies to think about how do we engage men in their experiences in the university.": 1,
    "If you talk to faculty, they may say,": 1,
    " Yeah, well they're playing video games and they're gambling online all night long and they're playing World of Warcraft and that's affecting their academic achievement, right?": 1,
    " Guess what?": 1,
    "Video games are not the cause.": 1,
    "Video games are a symptom.": 1,
    "They were turned off a long time before they got here.": 1,
    " All right, so let's talk about why they got turned off when they were between the ages of 3 and 13.": 1,
    "There are three reasons that I believe that boys are out of sync with the culture of schools today.": 1,
    " The first is zero tolerance, right?": 1,
    "Kindergarten teacher I know, her son donated all of his toys to her.": 1,
    "And when he did, she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns.": 1,
    " You can't have plastic knives and swords and axes and all that kind of thing in a kindergarten classroom.": 1,
    "What is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun?": 1,
    " I mean, really, you know?": 1,
    "But here he stands as testament to the fact that you can't roughhouse on the playground today.": 1,
    "No, I'm not advocating for bullies.": 1,
    " I'm not suggesting that we need to be, you know, allowing guns and knives into school.": 1,
    "But when we say that an Eagle Scout in a high school classroom who has a locked parked car in the parking lot and a penknife in it has to be suspended from school,": 1,
    " I think we may have gone a little too far with zero tolerance.": 1,
    "Another way that zero tolerance lives itself out is in the writing of boys.": 1,
    "In a lot of classrooms today, you're not allowed to write about anything that's violent.": 1,
    "You're not allowed to write about anything that has to do with video games.": 1,
    "These topics are banned.": 1,
    " Boy comes home from school and he says, I hate writing.": 1,
    "Why do you hate writing, son?": 1,
    "What's wrong with writing?": 1,
    "Now I have to write what she tells me to write.": 1,
    "Okay.": 1,
    "Well, what is she telling you to write?": 1,
    "Poems.": 1,
    "I have to write poems.": 1,
    " and little moments in my life.": 1,
    "I don't want to write that stuff.": 1,
    " All right, well, what do you want to write?": 1,
    "What do you want to write about?": 1,
    "I want to write about video games.": 1,
    "I want to write about leveling up.": 1,
    "I want to write about this really interesting world.": 1,
    "I want to write about a tornado that comes into our house and blows all the windows out and ruins all the furniture and kills everybody.": 1,
    "OK.": 1,
    "You tell a teacher that, and they'll ask you in all seriousness, should we send this child to the psychologist?": 1,
    " And he answers, no, he's just a boy.": 1,
    "He's just a little boy.": 1,
    "It's not OK to write these kinds of things in classrooms today.": 1,
    " So that's the first reason.": 1,
    "Zero tolerance policies in the way they're lived out.": 1,
    "The next reason that boys' cultures are out of sync with school cultures,": 1,
    " There are fewer male teachers.": 1,
    "Anybody who's over 15 doesn't know what this means.": 1,
    "Because in the last 10 years, the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half.": 1,
    "We went from 14% to 7%.": 1,
    " That means that 93% of the teachers that our young men get in elementary classrooms are women.": 1,
    "Now, what's the problem with this?": 1,
    "Women are great.": 1,
    "Yep, absolutely.": 1,
    " male role models for boys that say it's all right to be smart.": 1,
    "They've got dads, they've got pastors, they've got Cub Scout leaders, but ultimately, six hours a day, five days a week, they're spending in a classroom.": 1,
    " And most of those classrooms are not places where men exist.": 1,
    "And so they say, I guess this really isn't a place for boys.": 1,
    "This is a place for girls.": 1,
    "And I'm not very good at this, so I guess I'd better...": 1,
    " you know, go play video games or get into sports or something like that because I obviously don't belong here.": 1,
    "Men don't belong here, that's pretty obvious.": 1,
    "So that may be a very direct": 1,
    " way that we see it happen.": 1,
    "But less directly, the lack of male presence in the culture.": 1,
    "You've got a teacher's lounge and they're having a conversation about": 1,
    " Joey and Johnny who beat each other up on the playground, what are we going to do with these boys?": 1,
    "The answer to that question changes depending on who's sitting around that table.": 1,
    " Are there men around that table?": 1,
    "Are there moms who've raised boys around that table?": 1,
    "You'll see that the conversation changes depending upon who's sitting around the table.": 1,
    " The third reason that boys are out of sync with school today.": 1,
    "Kindergarten is the old second grade, folks.": 1,
    "We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there.": 1,
    "When you're three, you better be able to write your name legibly, or else we'll consider it a developmental delay.": 1,
    " By the time you're in first grade, you should be able to read paragraphs of text with maybe a picture, maybe not, in a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages.": 1,
    "If you don't, we're probably going to be putting you into a Title I special reading program.": 1,
    "And if you ask Title I teachers, they'll tell you,": 1,
    " They've got about four or five boys for every girl that's in their program in the elementary grades.": 1,
    " The reason that this is a problem...": 1,
    " is because the message that boys are getting is you need to do what the teacher asks you to do all the time.": 1,
    "All right?": 1,
    " The teacher's salary depends on no child left behind and race to the top and accountability and testing and all of this.": 1,
    "So she has to figure out a way.": 1,
    " to get all these boys through this curriculum and girls.": 1,
    " This compressed curriculum is bad for all active kids.": 1,
    " And what happens is she says, please, sit down, be quiet, do what you're told, follow the rules, manage your time, focus, be a girl.": 1,
    " It's what she tells them.": 1,
    "Indirectly, that's what she tells them.": 1,
    "And so this is a very serious problem.": 1,
    "Where is it coming from?": 1,
    "It's coming from us.": 1,
    " We want our babies to read when they are six months old.": 1,
    "Have you seen the ads?": 1,
    "We want to live in Lake Wobegon where every child is above average.": 1,
    "But what this does to our children is really not healthy.": 1,
    "It's not developmentally appropriate and it's particularly bad for boys.": 1,
    " So what do we do?": 1,
    "We need to meet them where they are.": 1,
    "We need to put ourselves into boy culture.": 1,
    "We need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys in elementary schools.": 1,
    " More specifically, we can do some very specific things.": 1,
    "We can design better games.": 1,
    "Most of the educational games that are out there today,": 1,
    " are really flashcards.": 1,
    "They're glorified drill and practice.": 1,
    "They don't have the depth, the rich narrative that really engaging video games have, that the boys are really interested in.": 1,
    "So we need to design better games.": 1,
    " We need to talk to teachers and parents and school board members and politicians.": 1,
    "We need to make sure that people see that we need more men in the classroom.": 1,
    "We need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies.": 1,
    "Do they make sense?": 1,
    " We need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can, trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them.": 1,
    "All of those conversations need to be happening.": 1,
    "There are some great examples out there of schools.": 1,
    " that the New York Times just talked about a school recently, a game designer from the New School put together a wonderful video gaming school, right?": 1,
    " But it only treats a few kids.": 1,
    "And so this isn't really very scalable.": 1,
    "We have to change the culture and the feelings that politicians and school board members and parents have about the way we accept and what we accept in our schools today.": 1,
    " We need to find more money for game design because good games, really good games, cost money and World of Warcraft has quite a budget.": 1,
    "Most of the educational games do not.": 1,
    " Where we started, my colleagues Mike Petner, Sean Vashon, myself, we started by trying to look at the teacher's attitudes and find out how do they really feel about gaming?": 1,
    "What do they say about it?": 1,
    " And we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school who talk about gaming in pretty demeaning ways.": 1,
    "They say, oh yeah, they're always talking about that stuff.": 1,
    "They're talking about their little action figures and their little": 1,
    " achievements or merit badges or whatever it is that they get.": 1,
    "They're always talking about this stuff.": 1,
    "They say these things as if it's okay, but if it were your culture, think of how that might feel.": 1,
    " It's very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that kind of language.": 1,
    "They are nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies.": 1,
    " They are sure that parents and administrators will never accept anything.": 1,
    "So we really need to think about looking at teacher attitudes and finding ways.": 1,
    " to change the attitudes so that teachers are much more open and accepting of boy cultures in their classrooms.": 1,
    "Because ultimately if we don't, then we're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying,": 1,
    " Well, I guess that was really just a place for girls.": 1,
    "It wasn't for me, you know.": 1,
    "So I've got to do gaming or I've got to do sports.": 1,
    "If we change these things, if we pay attention to these things and we re-engage boys in their learning, they will leave the elementary schools saying, I'm smart.": 1,
