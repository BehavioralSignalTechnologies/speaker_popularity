    " As an architect, I often ask myself, what is the origin of the forms that we design?": 1,
    "What kind of forms could we design if we wouldn't work with references anymore, if we have no bias, if we have no preconceptions?": 1,
    " What kind of forms could we design if we could free ourselves from our experience, if we could free ourselves from our education?": 1,
    " What would these unseen forms look like?": 1,
    "Would they surprise us?": 1,
    "Would they intrigue us?": 1,
    "Would they delight us?": 1,
    "If so, then how can we go about creating something that is truly new?": 1,
    " I propose we look to nature.": 1,
    "Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms.": 1,
    " And I'm not saying that we should copy nature.": 1,
    "I'm not saying we should mimic biology.": 1,
    "Instead, I propose that we can borrow nature's processes.": 1,
    "We can abstract them into create something that is new.": 1,
    " Nature's main process of creation, morphogenesis, is the splitting of one cell into two cells.": 1,
    "And these cells can either be identical or they can be distinct from each other through asymmetric cell division.": 1,
    " If we abstract this process and simplify it as much as possible, then we could start with a single sheet of paper, one surface, and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces.": 1,
    " we're free to choose where we make the fold.": 1,
    "And by doing so, we can differentiate the surfaces.": 1,
    "Through this very simple process, we can create an astounding variety of forms.": 1,
    " Now we can take this form and use the same process to generate three-dimensional structures.": 1,
    "But rather than folding things by hand, we'll bring the structure into the computer and encode it as an algorithm.": 1,
    " And in doing so, we can suddenly fold anything.": 1,
    "We can fold a million times faster.": 1,
    "We can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations.": 1,
    "And as we're seeking to make something three-dimensional,": 1,
    " We start not with a single surface but with a volume, a simple volume, the cube.": 1,
    "If we take its surfaces and fold them again and again and again and again, then after 16 iterations, 16 steps, we end up with 400,000 surfaces and a shape that looks": 1,
    " For instance, like this.": 1,
    "And if we change where we make the folds, if we change the folding ratio, then this cube turns into this one.": 1,
    "We can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape.": 1,
    " or this shape.": 1,
    "So we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we're making the fold, but essentially you're looking at a folded cube.": 1,
    " And we can play with this.": 1,
    "We can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions.": 1,
    " we can begin to sculpt the form.": 1,
    "And because we're doing the folding in the computer, we are completely free of any physical constraints.": 1,
    " So that means that surfaces can intersect themselves.": 1,
    "They can become impossibly small.": 1,
    "We can make folds that we otherwise could not make.": 1,
    "Surfaces can become porous.": 1,
    " They can stretch, they can tear, and all of this expands the scope of forms that we can produce.": 1,
    " But in each case, I didn't design the form.": 1,
    "I designed the processes that generated the form.": 1,
    " In general, if we make a small change to the folding ratio, which is what you're seeing here, then the form changes correspondingly.": 1,
    "But that's only half of the story.": 1,
    " 99.9% of the folding ratios produce not this, but this.": 1,
    "The geometric equivalent of noise.": 1,
    " The forms that I showed before were made actually through very long trial and error, a far more effective way to create forms I have found.": 1,
    " is to use information that is already contained in forms.": 1,
    "A very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye.": 1,
    "So, for instance, we can plot the length of the edges": 1,
    " White surfaces have long edges, black ones have short ones.": 1,
    "We can plot the planarity of the surfaces, their curvature, how radial they are.": 1,
    "All information that may not be instantly visible to you, but that we can bring out, that we can articulate.": 1,
    " and that we can use to control the folding.": 1,
    "So now I'm not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it, but instead I'm establishing a rule.": 1,
    "I'm establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded.": 1,
    " And because I've designed the process and not the form, I can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms.": 1,
    " These forms look elaborate, but the process is a very minimal one.": 1,
    "There's a simple input.": 1,
    "It's always a cube that I start with.": 1,
    "And it's a very simple operation.": 1,
    "It's making a fold and doing this over and over again.": 1,
    " So let's bring this process to architecture.": 1,
    "How and at what scale?": 1,
    "I chose to design a column.": 1,
    "Columns are architectural archetypes.": 1,
    " They've been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty, about technology.": 1,
    " The challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column.": 1,
    "I started using four cylinders.": 1,
    "Through a lot of experimentation, these cylinders eventually evolved.": 1,
    " into this.": 1,
    "And these columns, they have information at very many scales.": 1,
    "We can begin to zoom into them.": 1,
    " The closer one gets, the more new features one discovers.": 1,
    "Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility.": 1,
    "And unlike traditional architecture, it's a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail.": 1,
    " These forms are undrawable.": 1,
    "An architect who's drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months or it would take even a year to draw all the sections, all of the elevations.": 1,
    "You can only create something like this through an algorithm.": 1,
    " The more interesting question perhaps is, are these forms imaginable?": 1,
    "Usually an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he is designing.": 1,
    " In this case, the process is deterministic.": 1,
    "There's no randomness involved at all.": 1,
    "But it's not entirely predictable.": 1,
    "There's too many surfaces.": 1,
    "There's too much detail.": 1,
    "One can't see the end state.": 1,
    "So this leads to a new role for the architect.": 1,
    " One needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities that are out there.": 1,
    " For one thing, one can design many variants of a form in parallel and one can cultivate them.": 1,
    "And to go back to the analogy with nature, one can begin to think in terms of": 1,
    " populations, one can talk about permutations, about generations, about crossing and breeding to come up with a design.": 1,
    "And the architect is really, he moves into the position of being an orchestrator of all of these processes.": 1,
    " But enough of the theory.": 1,
    "At one point, I simply wanted to jump inside this image, so to say.": 1,
    " red and blue 3D glasses, very close to the screen, but still I wasn't the same as being able to walk around and touch things.": 1,
    "So there was only one possibility, to bring the column out of the computer.": 1,
    " There's been a lot of talk now about 3D printing.": 1,
    "For me, or for my purpose at this moment, there's still too much of an unfavorable trade-off between scale": 1,
    " and on the one hand and resolution and speed on the other.": 1,
    "So instead we decided to take the column and we decided to build as a layered model made out of very many slices thinly stacked over each other.": 1,
    " What you're looking at here is an x-ray of the column that you just saw viewed from the top.": 1,
    "Unbeknownst to me at the time, because we had only seen the outside, the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves to grow on the inside of the column.": 1,
    " which was quite a surprising discovery.": 1,
    "From this shape, we calculated a cutting line and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter.": 1,
    " to produce, and you're seeing a segment of it here, very many thin slices individually cut on top of each other.": 1,
    " And this is a photo now.": 1,
    "It's not a rendering.": 1,
    "And the column that we ended up with, after a lot of work, ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer.": 1,
    " Almost all of the details, almost all of the surface intricacies were preserved.": 1,
    " But it was very labor intensive.": 1,
    "There's a huge disconnect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical.": 1,
    " It took me several months to design the column, but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces.": 1,
    " The physical model, on the other hand, is 2,700 layers, one millimeter thick.": 1,
    "It weighs 700 kilos.": 1,
    "It's made of sheet that can cover this entire auditorium.": 1,
    " And the cutting path that the laser followed goes from here to the airport and back again.": 1,
    " But it is increasingly possible.": 1,
    "Machines are getting faster.": 1,
    "It's getting less expensive.": 1,
    "And there's some promising technological developments just on the horizon.": 1,
    " These are images from the Guangzhou Biennale and in this case I used ABS plastic to produce the columns.": 1,
    "We used a bigger faster machine and they have a steel core inside so they're structural, they can bear loads for once.": 1,
    " Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns.": 1,
    "You can see a different column in the mirror if there's a mirror behind the column that creates sort of an optical illusion.": 1,
    " So where does this leave us?": 1,
    "I think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us.": 1,
    "If we as architects begin to think about designing not the object, but a process to generate objects.": 1,
    " I've shown one simple process that was inspired by nature.": 1,
    "There's countless other ones.": 1,
    " In short, we have no constraints.": 1,
    "Instead, we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create structures at all scales that we couldn't even have dreamt up.": 1,
    " And if I may add, at one point, we will build them.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
