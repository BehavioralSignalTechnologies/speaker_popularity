    " This is a world-changing invention.": 1,
    "The smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide.": 1,
    "But smoke alarms don't prevent fires.": 1,
    " Every year in the USA over 20,000 are killed or injured with 350,000 home fires.": 1,
    "And one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity.": 1,
    " What if we could prevent electrical fires before they start?": 1,
    "Well, a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this.": 1,
    " So how does electricity ignite residential fires?": 1,
    "Well, it turns out that the main causes are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring.": 1,
    "Our invention had to address all of these issues.": 1,
    "So what about circuit breakers?": 1,
    " Well, Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in 1879.": 1,
    "This is 130 year old technology.": 1,
    " And this is a problem because over 80% of all home electrical fires start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers.": 1,
    " So we considered all of this and we realized that electrical appliances must be able to communicate directly with the power receptacle itself.": 1,
    "Any electrical device, an appliance, an extension cord, whatever,": 1,
    " must be able to tell the power outlet, hey, power outlet, I'm drawing too much current.": 1,
    "Shut me off now before I start a fire.": 1,
    "And the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it.": 1,
    "So here's what we did.": 1,
    "We put a 10-cent": 1,
    " digital transponder, a data tag in the appliance plug, and we put an inexpensive wireless data reader inside the receptacle so they could communicate.": 1,
    "Now every home electrical system becomes an intelligent network.": 1,
    " The appliance's safe operating parameters are embedded into its plug.": 1,
    " If too much current is flowing, the intelligent receptacle turns itself off and prevents another fire from starting.": 1,
    "We call this technology EFCI, electrical fault circuit interrupter.": 1,
    " Okay, two more points.": 1,
    "Every year in the USA roughly 2500 children are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries related to electrical receptacles and this is crazy.": 1,
    "An intelligent receptacle": 1,
    " prevents injuries because the power is always off until an intelligent plug is detected.": 1,
    "Simple.": 1,
    "Now besides saving lives, perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power is in its energy savings.": 1,
    " This invention will reduce global energy consumption by allowing remote control and automation of every outlet in every home and business.": 1,
    "Now you can choose to reduce your home energy bill.": 1,
    " by automatically cycling heavy loads like air conditioners and heaters.": 1,
    "Hotels and businesses.": 1,
    " can shut down unused rooms from a central location or even a cell phone.": 1,
    "There are 10 billion electrical outlets in North America alone.": 1,
    " The potential energy savings is very, very significant.": 1,
    "So far, we've applied for 414 patent claims.": 1,
    "Of those, 186 have been granted.": 1,
    " 228 are in process and I'm pleased to announce that just three weeks ago we received our first international recognition, the 2009 CES Innovation Award.": 1,
    " So, to conclude, intelligent power can globally save thousands of lives, prevent tens of thousands of injuries, and eliminate tens of billions of dollars": 1,
    " property damage every single year while significantly reducing global energy consumption.": 1,
    "In the spirit of this year's TED conference we think this is a powerful world-changing invention and I'd like to thank Chris": 1,
    " for this opportunity to unveil our technology with you and soon the world.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
