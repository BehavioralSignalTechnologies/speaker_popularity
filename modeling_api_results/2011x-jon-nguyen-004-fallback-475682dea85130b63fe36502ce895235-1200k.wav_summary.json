    " As a kid, I was fascinated with all things air and space.": 1,
    "I would watch Nova on BBS.": 1,
    "Our school would show Bill Nye, the science guy.": 1,
    " When I was in elementary school, my next door neighbor, he gave me a book for my birthday.": 1,
    "It was an astronomy book.": 1,
    " poured over that thing for hours on end.": 1,
    "And it was a combination of all these things that inspired me to pursue space exploration as my own personal dream.": 1,
    " And part of that dream was I always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft.": 1,
    " Well, a number of years later, I graduated from UCLA and I found myself at NASA working for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.": 1,
    " And there our team was challenged to create a 3D visualization of the solar system.": 1,
    "And today I want to show you what we've done so far.": 1,
    " Now, the kicker is everything I'm about to do here, you can do at home because we built this for the public for you guys to use.": 1,
    " So what you're looking at right now is the Earth.": 1,
    "You can see the United States and California and San Diego.": 1,
    "And you can use the mouse or the keyboard to spin things around.": 1,
    " Now, this isn't new.": 1,
    "Anyone who's used Google Earth has seen this before.": 1,
    "But one thing we like to say in our group is we do the opposite of Google Earth.": 1,
    "Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard.": 1,
    " we go from this view out to the stars.": 1,
    "So the Earth is cool, but what we really want to show are the spacecraft.": 1,
    "So I'm going to bring the interface back up.": 1,
    "And now you're looking at a number of satellites orbiting the Earth.": 1,
    " These are a number of our science-based Earth orbiters.": 1,
    "We haven't included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites.": 1,
    "If we did, it would be a complete mess, because there's a lot of stuff out there.": 1,
    " And the cool thing is we actually created 3D models for a number of these spacecraft.": 1,
    "So if you want to visit any of these, all you need to do is double click on them.": 1,
    "So I'm going to find the International Space Station.": 1,
    " Double click, and it'll take us all the way down to the ISS.": 1,
    "And now, you're riding along with the ISS where it is right now.": 1,
    " And the other cool thing is not only can we move the camera around, we can also control time.": 1,
    "So I can slide this jog dial here to shuttle time forward.": 1,
    "And now we can see what a sunset on the ISS would look like.": 1,
    " And they get one every 90 minutes.": 1,
    " All right.": 1,
    "So what about the rest of it?": 1,
    "Well, I can click on this home button over here, and that will take us up to the inner solar system.": 1,
    "And now we're looking at the rest of the solar system.": 1,
    "You can see there's Saturn, there's Jupiter.": 1,
    " And while we're here, I want to point out something.": 1,
    "It's actually pretty busy.": 1,
    "Here we have the Mars Science Laboratory on its way to Mars, just launched last weekend.": 1,
    "Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter.": 1,
    "There.": 1,
    " We have Don orbiting Vesta, and we have over here New Horizons in a straight shot to Pluto.": 1,
    " And I mention this because there's this strange public perception that NASA's dead, that the space shuttle stopped flying and all of a sudden there's no more spacecraft out there.": 1,
    "Well, a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration.": 1,
    " And we have a lot of spacecraft out there.": 1,
    "Granted, we're not sending humans up at the moment.": 1,
    "Well, at least with our own launch vehicles.": 1,
    "But NASA is far from dead.": 1,
    " And one of the reasons why we write a program like this is that people realize that there's so many other things that we're doing.": 1,
    "Anyway, while we're here, again, if you want to visit anything, all you need to do is double click.": 1,
    "So I'm just going to double click on Vesta.": 1,
    " And here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta.": 1,
    "And this is happening right now.": 1,
    " I'm going to double click on Uranus, and we can see Uranus rotating on its side along with its moons.": 1,
    "You can see how it's tilted at about 89 degrees.": 1,
    " And just being able to visit different places and go through different times.": 1,
    "We have data from 1950 to 2050.": 1,
    "Granted, we don't have everything in between because some of the data is hard to get.": 1,
    " Just being able to visit places in different times, you can explore this for hours, literally hours on end.": 1,
    " But I want to show you one thing in particular.": 1,
    "So I'm going to open up the destination tab, spacecraft outer planet missions, Voyager 1.": 1,
    "And I'm going to bring up the Titan flyby.": 1,
    " So now we've gone back in time.": 1,
    " We're now riding along with Voyager 1.": 1,
    "The date here is November 11, 1980.": 1,
    "There's a funny thing going on here.": 1,
    " It doesn't look like anything's going on.": 1,
    "It looks like I've paused the program.": 1,
    "It's actually running at real rate right now, one second per second.": 1,
    "And in fact, Voyager 1 here is flying by Titan at": 1,
    " I think it's 38,000 miles per hour.": 1,
    "It only looks like nothing's moving because Saturn here is 700,000 miles away, and Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away.": 1,
    "It's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing's happening.": 1,
    " But to make it more interesting, I'm going to speed up time, and we can watch as Voyager 1 flies by Titan.": 1,
    " Which is a hazy moon of Saturn.": 1,
    "It actually has a very thick atmosphere.": 1,
    "And I'm going to recenter the camera on Saturn here.": 1,
    " I'm going to pull out, and I want to show you Voyager 1 as it flies by Saturn.": 1,
    " There's a point to be made here.": 1,
    "With a 3D visualization like this, we can not only just say, Voyager 1 flew by Saturn.": 1,
    "There's a whole story to tell here.": 1,
    "And even better, because it's an interactive application, you can tell the story for yourself.": 1,
    " If you wanna pause it, you can pause it.": 1,
    "If you wanna keep going, if you wanna change the camera angle, you can do that.": 1,
    " And because of that, I can show you that Voyager 1 doesn't just fly by Saturn.": 1,
    "It actually flies underneath Saturn.": 1,
    " Now, what happens is as it flies underneath Saturn, Saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up and out of the solar system.": 1,
    "So if I just keep letting this go, you can see Voyager 1 fly up like that.": 1,
    " And in fact, I'm going to go back to the solar system.": 1,
    "I'm going to go back to today, now.": 1,
    "And I want to show you where Voyager 1 is.": 1,
    " Right there.": 1,
    " above, way above the solar system, way beyond our solar system.": 1,
    " And here's the thing.": 1,
    "Now you know how it got there.": 1,
    "Now you know why.": 1,
    "And to me, that's the point of this program.": 1,
    "You can manipulate it yourself.": 1,
    "You can fly around yourself.": 1,
    "And you can learn for yourself.": 1,
    " The theme today is the world in your grasp.": 1,
    "Well, we're trying to give you the solar system in your grasp.": 1,
    "And we hope once it's there, you'll be able to learn for yourself what we've done out there and what we're about to do.": 1,
    " And my personal dream is for kids to take this and explore and see the wonders out there and be inspired as I was as a kid to pursue STEM education and to pursue a dream in space exploration.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
