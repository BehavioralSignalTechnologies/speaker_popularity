    " I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype.": 1,
    "My wife sent me a message, whoa, earthquake, and then disappeared for 25 minutes.": 1,
    " It's 25 minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the US felt.": 1,
    " I was afraid of a tsunami.": 1,
    " What I didn't realize was there was a greater terror in Haiti, and that was building collapse.": 1,
    " We've all seen the photos of the collapsed buildings in Haiti.": 1,
    "These are shots my wife took a couple days after the quake while I was making my way through the DR into the country.": 1,
    " It's the National Palace, the equivalent of the White House.": 1,
    " This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean at peak shopping time.": 1,
    " This is a nurses college.": 1,
    "There are 300 nurses studying.": 1,
    " The general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed.": 1,
    " This is the Ministry of Economics, Finance.": 1,
    " We have all heard about the tremendous human loss in the earthquake in Haiti.": 1,
    " but we haven't heard enough about why all those lives were lost.": 1,
    "We haven't heard about why the buildings failed.": 1,
    " After all, it was the buildings, not the earthquake, that killed 220,000 people, that injured 330,000.": 1,
    " that displaced 1.3 million people.": 1,
    " that cut off food and water and supplies for an entire nation.": 1,
    " This is the largest metropolitan area disaster.": 1,
    " in decades.": 1,
    " And it was not a natural disaster.": 1,
    "It was a disaster of engineering.": 1,
    " AIDG has worked in Haiti since 2007, providing engineering and business support to small businesses.": 1,
    "And after the quake, we started bringing in earthquake engineers.": 1,
    " to figure out why the buildings collapsed, to examine what was safe and what wasn't.": 1,
    "Working with MINISTA, which is the UN mission in Haiti,": 1,
    " With the Ministry of Public Works, with different NGOs, we inspected over 1,500 buildings.": 1,
    " We inspected schools and private residences.": 1,
    "We inspected medical centers and food warehouses.": 1,
    " We inspected government buildings.": 1,
    "This is the Ministry of Justice.": 1,
    "Behind that door is the National Judicial Archives.": 1,
    "The fellow in the door, Andre Philtrout, is the": 1,
    " Director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Research at the University of Buffalo was examining it to see if it was safe to recover the archives.": 1,
    " Andre told me, after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way, that there is no new research here.": 1,
    "There is nothing here that we don't know.": 1,
    "The failure points were the same.": 1,
    " walls and slabs not tied properly into columns.": 1,
    "That's a roof slab hanging off the building.": 1,
    " cantilevered structures or structures that were asymmetric that shook violently and came down.": 1,
    " Poor building materials, not enough concrete, not enough compression in the blocks.": 1,
    " rebar that was smooth, rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away.": 1,
    "Now, there's a solution to all these problems.": 1,
    "And we know how to build properly.": 1,
    " The proof of this came in Chile, almost a month later, when 8.8 magnitude earthquake": 1,
    " hit Chile.": 1,
    "That is 500 times the power of the 7.0 that hit Port-au-Prince.": 1,
    " 500 times the power, yet only under a thousand casualties.": 1,
    " Adjusted for population density, there is less than 1% of the impact of the Haitian quake.": 1,
    " What was the difference between Chile and Haiti?": 1,
    " seismic standards, and confined masonry.": 1,
    " where the building acts as a whole, walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together to support each other instead of breaking off into separate members and failing.": 1,
    " If you look at this building in Chile, it's ripped in half, but it's not a pile of rubble.": 1,
    " Chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades.": 1,
    " Right now, AIDG is working with KPFF consulting engineers, Architecture for Humanity, to bring more confined masonry training into Haiti.": 1,
    " This is Exantes Daniel.": 1,
    "He's a mason, just a general construction worker, not a foreman.": 1,
    "He took one of our trainings.": 1,
    "On his last job, he was working with his boss and they started pouring the columns wrong.": 1,
    " He took his boss aside and showed him the materials on confined masonry.": 1,
    "He showed him, you know, we don't have to do this wrong.": 1,
    "It won't cost us any more to do it the right way.": 1,
    "And they redid that building.": 1,
    " They tied the rebar right.": 1,
    "They poured the columns right.": 1,
    "And that building will be safe.": 1,
    "And every building that they build going forward will be safe.": 1,
    " To make sure these buildings are safe, it's not going to take policy.": 1,
    "It's going to take reaching out to the masons on the ground and helping them learn the proper techniques.": 1,
    " Now there are many groups doing this, and the fellow in the vest there, Craig Toton,": 1,
    " He has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this.": 1,
    "Through Haiti Rewired, through Build Change, Architecture for Humanity, AIDG.": 1,
    " there is the possibility to reach out to 30,000, 40,000 masons across the country and create a movement of proper building.": 1,
    " If you reach out to the people on the ground in this collaborative way, it's extremely affordable.": 1,
    "For the billions spent,": 1,
    " on reconstruction, you can train masons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their lifetime.": 1,
    " Ultimately, there are two ways that you can rebuild Haiti.": 1,
    "The way at the top is the way that Haiti's been building for decades.": 1,
    "The way at the top is a poorly constructed building that will fail.": 1,
    " The way at the bottom is a confined masonry building, where the walls are tied together, the building is symmetric, and it will stand up to an earthquake.": 1,
    " For all the disaster, there is an opportunity here to build better houses for the next generation so that when the next earthquake hits,": 1,
    " is a disaster, but not a tragedy.": 1
