    " When I was 11, I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house.": 1,
    " My father was listening to BBC News on his small gray radio.": 1,
    " There was a big smile on his face, which was unusual then because the news mostly depressed him.": 1,
    " The Taliban are gone, my father shouted.": 1,
    " I didn't know what it meant.": 1,
    " But I could see that my father was very, very happy.": 1,
    " You can go to a real school now.": 1,
    " He said.": 1,
    " a morning that I will never forget.": 1,
    " a real school.": 1,
    " You see, I was six when Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.": 1,
    " So for the next five years, I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister who was no longer allowed to be outside alone to a secret school.": 1,
    " It was the only way we both could be educated.": 1,
    " Each day we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going.": 1,
    " We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping.": 1,
    " The school was in a house, more than 100 of us packed in one small living room.": 1,
    " It was cozy in winter, but extremely hot in summer.": 1,
    " We all knew we were risking our lives, the teacher, the students, and our parents.": 1,
    " From time to time a school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious.": 1,
    " We always wondered what they knew about us.": 1,
    "Were we being followed?": 1,
    " Do they know where we live?": 1,
    " We were scared.": 1,
    " But still, school was where we wanted to be.": 1,
    " I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured.": 1,
    " My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.": 1,
    " a total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan.": 1,
    "He insisted that his daughter, my mom,": 1,
    " go to school.": 1,
    "And for that he was disowned by his father.": 1,
    " But my educated mother became a teacher.": 1,
    "There she is.": 1,
    " She retired two years ago only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood.": 1,
    " And my father, that's him.": 1,
    " He was the first ever in his family to receive an education.": 1,
    " There was no question that his children will receive an education, including his daughters.": 1,
    " despite the Taliban, despite the risks.": 1,
    "To him, there was greater risk in not educating his children.": 1,
    " During Taliban years, I remember": 1,
    " There were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future.": 1,
    "I would want to quit.": 1,
    " but my father.": 1,
    " he would say.": 1,
    " Listen, my daughter, you can lose everything you own in your life.": 1,
    "Your money can be stolen.": 1,
    "You can be forced to leave your home during a war.": 1,
    "But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here.": 1,
    " And if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees, we will.": 1,
    " So do you still not want to continue?": 1,
    " Today I'm 22.": 1,
    " I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.": 1,
    " Fewer than 6% of women my age have made it beyond high school.": 1,
    "And had my family not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.": 1,
    " Instead, I stand here, a proud graduate of Middlebury College.": 1,
    " When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters, was among the first to congratulate me.": 1,
    " He not only brags about my college degree, but also that I was the first woman and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul.": 1,
    " My family believes in me.": 1,
    "I dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me.": 1,
    " That's why I'm a global ambassador for 10x10, a global campaign to educate women.": 1,
    "That's why I co-founded Sola, the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan, a country": 1,
    " where it's still risky for girls to go to school.": 1,
    " The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing that opportunity.": 1,
    " And I see their parents and their fathers who like my own.": 1,
    " advocate for them.": 1,
    " despite.": 1,
    " and even in the face of daunting opposition.": 1,
    " Like Ahmad, that's not his real name, and I cannot show you his face, but Ahmad is the father of one of my students.": 1,
    " Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were on their way from Sola to their village.": 1,
    " and...": 1,
    " They literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb.": 1,
    " by minutes.": 1,
    " As he arrived home, the phone rang, a voice warning him.": 1,
    " that if he sent his daughter back to school, they would try again.": 1,
    " Kill me now if you wish, he said, but I will not ruin my daughter's future because of your old and backward ideas.": 1,
    " What I've come to realize about Afghanistan, and this is something that is often dismissed in the West, that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter.": 1,
    " and who sees that her success is his success.": 1,
    " It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success.": 1,
    "In fact, they're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters.": 1,
    " But in the context of a society like in Afghanistan, we must have the support of men.": 1,
    " Under the Taliban, girls who went to school numbered in hundreds.": 1,
    "Remember, it was illegal.": 1,
    "But today, more than 3 million girls are in school in Afghanistan.": 1,
    " Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.": 1,
    " I find that Americans see the fragility in changes.": 1,
    "I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the US troops withdrawal.": 1,
    " But when I'm back in Afghanistan.": 1,
    " When I see": 1,
    " the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them, who encourage them.": 1,
    "I see a promising future and lasting change.": 1,
    " To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities.": 1,
    " and every single day.": 1,
    " The girls of solar remind me of that.": 1,
    " Like me, they are dreaming big.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
