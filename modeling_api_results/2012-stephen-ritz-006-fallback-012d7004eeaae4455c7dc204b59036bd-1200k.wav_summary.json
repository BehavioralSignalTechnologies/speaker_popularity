    "And what do you know?": 2,
    " Good afternoon.": 1,
    "I am not a farmer.": 1,
    "I'm not.": 1,
    "I'm a parent.": 1,
    "I'm a resident and I'm a teacher and this is my world.": 1,
    " And along the way, I've started noticing, among my third generation of kids, that they're getting bigger.": 1,
    "They're getting sicker.": 1,
    "In addition to these complexities, I just learned that 70% of the kids that I see who are labeled learning disabled would not have been had they had proper prenatal nutrition.": 1,
    " The realities of my community are simple.": 1,
    "They look like this.": 1,
    "Kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this.": 1,
    "And as jobs continue to leave my community and energy continues to come in and be exported in,": 1,
    " It's no wonder that really some people refer to the South Bronx as a desert.": 1,
    "But I'm the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet, so I get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm that I'm hoping to share with you all today.": 1,
    " And with that note, I come with you with this belief that kids should not have to leave their community to live, learn, and earn a better one.": 1,
    "So I'm here to tell you a story about me and this wall that I met outside, which I'm now bringing inside.": 1,
    "And it starts with three people.": 1,
    " I'm a crazy teacher.": 1,
    "That's me on the left.": 1,
    "I dress up pretty.": 1,
    "Thank you, my wife.": 1,
    "I love you for getting a good suit.": 1,
    "My passionate photo president and a guy named George Erwin from Green Living Technologies who helped me with my class and helped me get involved with this patented technology.": 1,
    " But it all starts with C's in classrooms, in my place, which looks like this.": 1,
    "And I'm here today": 1,
    " Hopefully that my reach will exceed my grasp.": 1,
    "And that's really what this is all about.": 1,
    "And it starts with incredible kids like this who come early and stay late.": 1,
    " All of my kids are either IEP or ELL learners.": 1,
    "Most come with a lot of handicaps.": 1,
    "Most are homeless and many are in foster care.": 1,
    "Almost all of my kids live below poverty.": 1,
    " But with those seeds, from day one, we are growing in my classroom.": 1,
    "And this is what it looks like in my classroom.": 1,
    "And you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds.": 1,
    "And then you notice that those seeds become farms across the Bronx that look like this.": 1,
    " But again, I am not a farmer.": 1,
    "I'm a teacher, and I don't like weeding, and I don't like backbraiding labor.": 1,
    "So I wanted to figure out how to get this kind of success into something small like this.": 1,
    " and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it.": 1,
    "Kids who didn't want to be outside could do it and everyone could have access.": 1,
    "So I called George Irwin and what do you know?": 1,
    "He came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall.": 1,
    " And what we do is we partnered with Authentic Learning Experience, private-based learning.": 1,
    "And lo and behold, we gave birth to the first edible wall in New York City.": 1,
    "So if you're hungry, get up and eat.": 1,
    "You can do it right now.": 1,
    "My kids play cow all the time.": 1,
    " Okay, but we were just getting started the kids love the technology so we called up Jordan.": 1,
    "We said we got to learn more now they have": 1,
    " Bloomberg, thank you very much.": 1,
    "We no longer need work permits, which comes with license and bonded contractors.": 1,
    "We're available for you.": 1,
    "We decided to go to Boston, and my kids from the poorest congressional district in America became": 1,
    " The first to install a green wall designed by a computer with real-life learning skills, 21 stories up.": 1,
    "You're going to go visit it.": 1,
    "It's on top of the John Hancock building.": 1,
    " But closer to home, we started installing these walls in schools.": 1,
    "It looked like this, with lighting like that.": 1,
    "Real LED stuff.": 1,
    "21st century technology.": 1,
    "We made 21st century money.": 1,
    "And that was groundbreaking.": 1,
    "And wow!": 1,
    "This is my harvest, people.": 1,
    " And what do you do with this food?": 1,
    "You cook it.": 1,
    "None of them are heirloom students making heirloom sauce with plastic forks.": 1,
    "And we get it into the cafeteria and we roast up and we feed our teachers.": 1,
    " And that is the youngest nationally certified workforce in America with our Bronx borough president.": 1,
    "And what did we do then?": 1,
    "Well, I met nice people like you.": 1,
    "And they invited us to the Hampton.": 1,
    "So I call this from South Bronx to South Hampton.": 1,
    " And we started putting in rooms that looked like this.": 1,
    "And when kids from destitute neighborhoods can start building landscape like this, wow, people noticed.": 1,
    "And so we got invited back this past summer.": 1,
    "We actually moved into the Hamptons, paying $3,500 a week for a house.": 1,
    "And we learned how to surf.": 1,
    " And when you can do stuff like this...": 1,
    " These are my kids putting in this technology when you can build a roof that looks like that, on a house that looks like that, with sedum that looks like this.": 1,
    "This is the new green graffiti.": 1,
    " So you may wonder, what does a wall like this really do for kids besides changing landscapes and mindsets?": 1,
    "OK, I'm going to tell you what it does.": 1,
    " It gets me to meet incredible contractors like this.": 1,
    "Jim Ellenberger from Ellenberger Services.": 1,
    "And this is where it becomes true triple bottom line.": 1,
    "Because Jim realized that these kids, my future farmers, really had the skills he needed to build affordable housing for New Yorkers.": 1,
    " right in our own neighborhood.": 1,
    "And this is what my kids are doing, making living wage.": 1,
    "Now, if you're like me, you live in a building where there are seven guys out of work looking to manage a million dollars.": 1,
    "I don't have it.": 1,
    "But if you need a toilet fixed or, you know, some shelving,": 1,
    " I gotta wait six months for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me.": 1,
    "That's the beauty of this economy.": 1,
    "But, my kids are now licensed and violated in training.": 1,
    "That's my first student to open up.": 1,
    "The first in his family to have a bank account.": 1,
    "This immigrant student, the first one in his family to use an ATM.": 1,
    " And this is the true triple bottom line, because we can take neighborhoods that were abandoned and destitute and turn them into something like this, with interiors like this.": 1,
    "Wow, people noticed.": 1,
    "And noticed they did, so CNN called.": 1,
    "And we were delighted to have them come to our farmers market.": 1,
    " And then when Rockefeller Center said, NBC, could you put in some edible walls?": 1,
    "We were delighted.": 1,
    "But this I show you when kids from the poorest congressional district in America can build a 30 foot by 15 foot wall, design it, plant it, and install it in the heart of New York City.": 1,
    "That's a true season.": 1,
    " they play their moment.": 1,
    "Really, scholastic if you ask me.": 1,
    "But this is not a Getty image.": 1,
    "That's a picture I took of my Bronx Borough president addressing my kids in his house, not the jailhouse, making them feel a part of": 1,
    " That's our state senator Gustavo Rivera and Bob Beter coming to my classroom to make my kids feel important.": 1,
    "And when the Bronx world president shows up and the state senator comes to our class, believe you me, the Bronx can.": 1,
    " change attitudes now we are poised ready willing and able to export our talent diversity in ways we've never even imagined and when the local senator gets on a scale public and says he's got to lose weight": 1,
    " So do I. And I tell you what, I'm doing it.": 1,
    "And so are the kids.": 1,
    "OK?": 1,
    "And then celebrities start visiting.": 1,
    "Produce Pete can't believe what we grow.": 1,
    "Lorna Sass came and donated books.": 1,
    " Okay, we're feeding seniors.": 1,
    "And when we realized that we were growing for food justice in the South Bronx, so did the international community.": 1,
    "And my kids from the South Bronx were repped in the first International Green Roof Conference.": 1,
    "That's just great, except what about locally?": 1,
    " Well, we met this woman, Avis Richards, with the ground-up campaign.": 1,
    "Unbelievable.": 1,
    "Through her, my kids, the most disenfranchised and marginalized, were able to roll out": 1,
    " hundred gardens to New York City public schools.": 1,
    "That's triple bottom line, okay?": 1,
    "A year ago today I was invited to the New York Academy of Medicine.": 1,
    "I thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy New York made sense.": 1,
    " especially when the resources were free.": 1,
    "So thank you all and I love them.": 1,
    "They introduced me to the New York City Strategic Alliance for Health.": 1,
    "Again, free resources.": 1,
    " Don't waste them.": 1,
    "Six months later, my school and my kids was awarded the first ever High School Award of Excellence for creating a healthy school environment.": 1,
    "The greenest class in New York City.": 1,
    "But more importantly, as my kids learn to get,": 1,
    " they learned to give.": 1,
    "And we took the money that we made from our farmer's market and started buying gifts for the homeless and for needy around the world.": 1,
    "So we started giving back.": 1,
    "And that's when I realized that the greening of America starts first with the pocket.": 1,
    " then with the heart, and then with the mind.": 1,
    "So we were onto something, and we're still onto something.": 1,
    "And thank God Trinity Wall Street noticed, because they gave us the birth of Green Bronx Machine.": 1,
    "We're 3,000 strong right now.": 1,
    "And what does it really do?": 1,
    " It teaches kids to revision their communities.": 1,
    "So when they grow up in places like this, they can imagine it like this.": 1,
    "And my kids, trained and certified, mind you, get the tax abatement like the Mayor of Bloomberg, can take communities that look like this and convert them into things that look like that.": 1,
    " And that, to me, people, is another true see-see point in moment.": 1,
    "Now, how does it start?": 1,
    "It starts in schools.": 1,
    "No more little nicks and little nets.": 1,
    "Group by broccoli.": 1,
    "Group by your favorite vegetable, something you can aspire to.": 1,
    "And these are my future farmers of America.": 1,
    " Growing up in Brook Park on 141st Street, the most migrant community in America, when tenacious little ones learn how to garden like this, it's no wonder we get fruit like that.": 1,
    " And I love it, and so do they.": 1,
    "And we're building teepees with the neighborhoods that we're burning down.": 1,
    "And that's a true See St.": 1,
    "Puey Day moment.": 1,
    "And again, Brook Park.": 1,
    " feeds hundreds of people without a food stamp or a fingerprint.": 1,
    "The poorest congressional district in America, the most migratory community in America, we can do this.": 1,
    "Bissell Gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions.": 1,
    " Moving kids into an economy they never imagined.": 1,
    "Now, somewhere over the rainbow, my friends, is the south prompts of America.": 1,
    "And we're doing it.": 1,
    " How does it start?": 1,
    "Well, look at Jose's attention to detail.": 1,
    "Thank God Omar knows that carrots come from the ground and not I'll not in the supermarket or through a bulletproof window or through a piece of styrofoam.": 1,
    " And when Henry knows that green is good, so do I. And when you expand their palates, you expand their vocabulary.": 1,
    "And most importantly, when you put big kids together with little kids, you get the big fat white guy out of the middle, which is cool.": 1,
    " And you create this kind of accountability amongst peers, which is incredible.": 1,
    "God, I'm gonna run out of time, so I gotta keep it moving.": 1,
    "But this is my weekly paycheck for kids.": 1,
    "That's our green graffiti.": 1,
    "This is what we're doing.": 1,
    " And behold, the glory and bounty that is Bronx County.": 1,
    "Nothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other.": 1,
    "I gotta tell you, I'm a protective parrot.": 1,
    " But those kids are the kids who are now putting our pumpkin patches on top of trains.": 1,
    "We're also designing koi ponds for the Richard Affluent.": 1,
    "We're also becoming children of the Corpus.": 1,
    " creating farms in the middle of Fordham Road for awareness and window bottles out of garbage.": 1,
    "Now, I don't expect every kid to be a farmer, but I expect them to read about it, write about it, blog about it, and offer outstanding customer service.": 1,
    "I expect them to be engaged.": 1,
    "Man, are they.": 1,
    "So that's my incredible classroom.": 1,
    "That's the food.": 1,
    " Where does it go?": 1,
    "Zero miles to plate, right down into the cafeteria, or more importantly to local shelters where most of our kids are getting one to two meals a day.": 1,
    "And we're stepping it up.": 1,
    " No Air Jordans were ever ruined on my farm, and in this day of million dollar gardens and incredible installations, let me tell you something, people.": 1,
    "This is a beautiful moment.": 1,
    " You know, black fuel, brown fuel, toxic waste fuel, battlefield.": 1,
    "We're proving in the Bronx that you can grow anywhere on cement.": 1,
    "And, you know, we take orders for flowers.": 1,
    "I'm putting the big sale to shame.": 1,
    "We take orders now.": 1,
    "We're booking for the spring.": 1,
    " Okay, and these are all grown from seeds.": 1,
    "We're learning everything.": 1,
    "And again, when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse as this to do something as special as this, we're really creating a moment.": 1,
    "Now, you may ask about these kids.": 1,
    " 40% attendance to 93% attendance.": 1,
    "All start over age and under credit.": 1,
    "They are now, my first cohort is all in college earning living wage.": 1,
