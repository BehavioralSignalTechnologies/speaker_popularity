    " What would that mean?": 2,
    " Clouds.": 1,
    " Do you even notice how much people moan about them?": 1,
    "They get a bad rap.": 1,
    "If you think about it, the English language has written into it negative associations towards the clouds.": 1,
    "Someone who's down or depressed.": 1,
    " They're under a cloud.": 1,
    "And when there's bad news in store, there's a cloud on the horizon.": 1,
    "I saw an article the other day.": 1,
    "It was about problems with computer processing over the internet.": 1,
    "A cloud over the cloud.": 1,
    " It was a headline.": 1,
    " It seems like they're everyone's default doom and gloom metaphor.": 1,
    "But I think they're beautiful, don't you?": 1,
    "It's just that their beauty is missed because they're so omnipresent, so, I don't know, commonplace.": 1,
    " that people don't notice them.": 1,
    "They don't notice the beauty, but they don't even notice the clouds unless they get in the way of the sun.": 1,
    "And so people think of clouds as the things that get in the way.": 1,
    " They think of them as the annoying, frustrating obstructions, and then they rush off and do some blue sky thinking.": 1,
    " But most people, when you stop to ask them, will admit to harbouring a strange sort of fondness for clouds.": 1,
    "It's like a nostalgic fondness.": 1,
    "And they make them think of their youth.": 1,
    " Who here can't remember looking and finding shapes in the clouds when they were kids?": 1,
    "You know, when you were masters of daydreaming.": 1,
    " Aristophanes, the ancient Greek playwright, he described the clouds as the patron goddesses of idle fellows two and a half thousand years ago.": 1,
    "And you can see what he means.": 1,
    "It's just that these days us adults seem reluctant.": 1,
    " to allow ourselves the indulgence of just allowing our imaginations to drift along in the breeze.": 1,
    " a pity.": 1,
    "I think we should perhaps do a bit more of it.": 1,
    "I think we should be a bit more willing perhaps to look at the beautiful sight of the sunlight bursting out from behind the clouds and go": 1,
    " Wait a minute, there's two cats dancing in the salsa.": 1,
    " For seeing the big white puffy one up there over the shopping center looks like the abominable snowman going to rob a bank.": 1,
    " They're like nature's version of those inkblot imiters.": 1,
    "You know that Shrinks used to show their patients in the 60s.": 1,
    "And I think if you consider the shapes you see in the clouds, you'll save money on psychoanalysis.": 1,
    " Let's say you're in love, alright, and you look up and what do you see?": 1,
    " Right?": 1,
    "Or maybe the opposite.": 1,
    "You've just been dumped by your partner and everywhere you look it's kissing couples.": 1,
    " Perhaps you're having a moment of existential angst.": 1,
    "You know, you're thinking about your own mortality, and there on the horizon, it's the Grim Reaper.": 1,
    " Or maybe you see a topless sunbather.": 1,
    " I've no idea.": 1,
    " But one thing I do know is this.": 1,
    "The bad press that clouds get is totally unfair.": 1,
    "I think we should stand up for them, which is why a few years ago I started the Cloud Appreciation Society.": 1,
    " Tens of thousands of members now in almost a hundred countries around the world.": 1,
    "And all these photographs that I'm showing, they were sent in by members.": 1,
    " And the society exists to remind people of this.": 1,
    "Clouds are not something to moan about.": 1,
    "Far from it, they are in fact the most diverse, evocative, poetic aspect of nature.": 1,
    " I think if you live with your head in the clouds every now and then, it helps you keep your feet on the ground.": 1,
    "And I want to show you why with the help of some of my favorite types of cloud.": 1,
    "Let's start with this one.": 1,
    "It's the cirrus cloud named after the Latin for a lock of hair.": 1,
    " It's composed entirely of ice crystals cascading from the upper reaches of the troposphere.": 1,
    "And as these ice crystals fall, they pass through different layers with different winds and they speed up and slow down.": 1,
    " giving the cloud these brush-stroked appearances, these brush-stroke forms known as fall streaks.": 1,
    "And these winds up there can be very, very fierce.": 1,
    "They can be 200 miles an hour, 300 miles an hour.": 1,
    "These clouds are bombing along, but from all the way down here,": 1,
    " they appear to be moving gracefully, slowly, like most clouds.": 1,
    "And so to tune in to the clouds is to slow down, to calm down.": 1,
    "It's like a bit of everyday meditation.": 1,
    " Those are common clouds.": 1,
    "What about rare ones like the lenticularis, the UFO-shaped lenticularis cloud?": 1,
    "These clouds form in the region of mountains.": 1,
    "When the wind passes, rises to pass over the mountain, it can take on a wave-like path in the lee of the peak.": 1,
    " with these crowds hovering at the crest of these invisible standing waves of air.": 1,
    "These flying saucer-like forms and some of the early black and white UFO photos are in fact lenticularis clouds, it's true.": 1,
    " Little rarer are the full streak holes, right?": 1,
    "This is when a layer is made up of very, very cold water droplets.": 1,
    "And in one region, they start to freeze.": 1,
    "And this freezing sets off a chain reaction which spreads outwards with the ice crystals cascading and falling down below.": 1,
    " giving the appearance of jellyfish tendrils down below.": 1,
    "Rarer still, the Kelvin Helmholtz Cloud.": 1,
    "Not a very snappy name.": 1,
    " need to rebrand.": 1,
    "This looks like a series of breaking waves and it's caused by shearing winds.": 1,
    "The wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer differ significantly and in the middle": 1,
    " In between, you get this undulating of the air, and if the difference in those speeds is just right, the tops of the undulations curl over in these beautiful breaking wave-like vortices.": 1,
    "Those are rarer clouds than the cirrus, but they're not that rare.": 1,
    " If you look up and you pay attention to the sky, you'll see them sooner or later.": 1,
    "Maybe not quite as dramatic as these, but you'll see them.": 1,
    "And you'll see them around where you live.": 1,
    "Clouds are the most egalitarian.": 1,
    " of nature's displays because we all have a good fantastic view of the sky.": 1,
    " And these clouds, these rarer clouds remind us that the exotic can be found in the everyday.": 1,
    "Nothing's more nourishing, more stimulating to an active, inquiring mind.": 1,
    " than being surprised, being amazed.": 1,
    "It's why we're all here at TED, right?": 1,
    " But you don't need to rush off away from the familiar, across the world, to be surprised.": 1,
    "You just need to step outside.": 1,
    "Pay attention to what's so commonplace, so everyday, so mundane.": 1,
    " that everybody else misses it.": 1,
    "One cloud that people rarely miss is this one, the cumulonimbus storm cloud.": 1,
    "It produces thunder and lightning and hail.": 1,
    "These clouds spread out at the top in this": 1,
    " enormous anvil fashion stretching ten miles up into the atmosphere.": 1,
    "They are an expression of the majestic architecture of our atmosphere.": 1,
    "But from down below they are the embodiment of": 1,
    " powerful elemental force and power that drives our atmosphere.": 1,
    "To be there is to be connected in the driving rain and the hail to feel connected to our atmosphere.": 1,
    " is to be reminded that we are creatures that inhabit this ocean of air.": 1,
    "We don't live beneath the sky, we live within it.": 1,
    "And that connection, that visceral connection to our atmosphere": 1,
    " Feels to me like an antidote.": 1,
    "It's an antidote to the growing tendency we have to feel that we can really ever experience life by watching it on a computer screen, you know, when we're in a Wi-Fi zone.": 1,
    " But the one cloud that best expresses why cloud spotting is more valuable today than ever is this one, the cumulus cloud.": 1,
    "It forms on a sunny day.": 1,
    " If you close your eyes and think of a cloud, it's probably one of these that comes to mind.": 1,
    "All those cloud shapes at the beginning, those were cumulus clouds.": 1,
    " Sharp, crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in.": 1,
    " And it reminds us of the aimless nature of cloud spotting.": 1,
    "What an aimless activity it is.": 1,
    "You're not going to change the world by lying on your back and gazing up at the sky, are you?": 1,
    " It's pointless.": 1,
    "It's a pointless activity which is precisely why it's so important.": 1,
    " The digital world conspires to make us feel eternally busy, perpetually busy.": 1,
    "When you're not dealing with the traditional pressures of": 1,
    " earning a living, putting food on the table, raising a family, writing thank you letters.": 1,
    "You have to now contend with": 1,
    " answering a mountain of unanswered emails, updating your Facebook page, feeding your Twitter feed.": 1,
    "And cloud spotting legitimizes doing nothing.": 1,
    " And sometimes we need...": 1,
    " Sometimes we need excuses to do nothing.": 1,
    "We need to be reminded by these patron goddesses of idle fellows that slowing down": 1,
    " and being in the present, not thinking about what you've got to do and what you should have done.": 1,
    " But just being here, letting your imagination lift from the everyday concerns down here and just being in the present, it's good for you.": 1,
    "It's good for the way you feel.": 1,
    "It's good for your ideas.": 1,
    "It's good for your creativity.": 1,
    "It's good for your soul.": 1,
    " So keep looking up.": 1,
    " Marvel at the ephemeral beauty.": 1,
    "And always remember to live life with your head in the clouds.": 1,
    "Thank you very much.": 1
