    "We have pan-feared registry air, sprinkled with the finest corrupted data, binary brioche, ram sandwiches, configured fritters, and a scripting style with or without polymer for dressing and a grilled coating kebab.": 1,
    " I'd like a ram sandwich.": 1,
    "And a glass of your finest code 39.": 1,
    "Would you like any dessert sir?": 1,
    "Our special tracking cookies.": 1,
    "I'd like a batch of some zombie tracking cookies, thank you.": 1,
    " Coming right up sir, your food will be served shortly.": 1,
    " I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon.": 1,
    "And I've been making animated flip books since I was three years old.": 1,
    "At that age, I also learned about what an animator was.": 1,
    "There's a program on TV about jobs most kids don't know about.": 1,
    " When I understood that an animator makes the cartoons I saw on TV, I immediately said, that's what I want to be.": 1,
    " I don't know if I said it mentally or out loud, but that was a greatly defining moment in my life.": 1,
    " Animation and art has always been my first love.": 1,
    " It was my love for technology that spiked the idea for malicious dishes.": 1,
    "There was a virus on my computer, and I was trying to get rid of it.": 1,
    "And all of a sudden, I just thought, what if viruses have their own little world inside the computer?": 1,
    " maybe a restaurant where they meet up and do viracy things.": 1,
    "And thus, Malicious Dishes was born.": 1,
    " At four years old, my dad showed me how to take apart a computer and put it back together again.": 1,
    "That started my love for technology.": 1,
    "I built my first website myself in HTML, and I'm learning JavaScript and Python.": 1,
    " I'm also working on an animated series called The Polynaers.": 1,
    "It's about bees and other polynaers in our environment and why they're so important.": 1,
    " If plants aren't pollinated by the pollinators, then all creatures, including ourselves that depend on these plants, would starve.": 1,
    "So I decided to take these cool creatures and make a superhero team.": 1,
    " The forest source!": 1,
    "I should have known!": 1,
    "I need to call the rest of the pollinators!": 1,
    " All of my animations start with ideas, but what are ideas?": 1,
    "Ideas can spark a movement.": 1,
    "Ideas are opportunities and innovation.": 1,
    " Ideas truly are what make the world go round.": 1,
    " If it wasn't for ideas, we wouldn't be where we are now with technology, medicine, art, culture, and how we even live our lives.": 1,
    " At eight years old, I took my ideas and started my own business called Maya's Ideas and my non-profit Maya's Ideas for the Planet.": 1,
    " and I make eco-friendly clothing and accessories.": 1,
    " I'm 13 now, and although I started my business in 2008, my artistic journey started way before them.": 1,
    " I was greatly influenced by art, and I once incorporated in everything I did, even my business.": 1,
    "I would find different fabrics around the house and say, this could be a scarf or a hat, and I had all these ideas for designs.": 1,
    " I noticed when I wore my creations, people stop me and say, wow, that's really cute.": 1,
    "Where can I get one?": 1,
    "And I thought, I can start my own business.": 1,
    " Now, I didn't have any business plans though, only eight years old.": 1,
    "I only knew I wanted to make pretty creations that were safe for the environment and I wanted to give back.": 1,
    " My mom taught me how to sew, and on my back porch, I would sit and make little headbands out of ribbon.": 1,
    "And I'd write down the names and the prices of each item.": 1,
    "I started making more items like hats, scarves, and bags.": 1,
    " Soon my items began selling all over the world.": 1,
    "My customers in Denmark, Italy, Australia, Canada, and more.": 1,
    " Now I had a lot to learn about my business, like branding and marketing, staying engaged with my customers, and seeing what sold the most and the least.": 1,
    " Soon my business really started to take off.": 1,
    "Then one day Forbes Magazine contacted me when I was 10 years old.": 1,
    " They want to feature me and my company in their article.": 1,
    " Now, a lot of people ask me, why is your business eco-friendly?": 1,
    "I've had a passion for protecting the environment and its creatures since I was little.": 1,
    "My parents taught me at an early age about giving back and being a good steward to the environment.": 1,
    " I heard about how the dyes in some clothing or the process of even making the items was harmful to the people and the planet.": 1,
    "So I started doing my own research, and I discovered that even after a dye has been completed, there is a wastage that gives a negative impact on the environment.": 1,
    " For example, the grinding of materials or the dumping of dried power materials.": 1,
    "These actions can pollute the air, making it toxic to anyone or anything that inhales it.": 1,
    "So when I started my business, I knew two things.": 1,
    " All of my items had to be eco-friendly, and 10 to 20% of the profits I made went to local and global charities and environmental organizations.": 1,
    " I feel I'm part of the new wave of entrepreneurs that not only seeks to have a successful business, but also a sustainable future.": 1,
    "I feel that I can meet the needs of my customers without compromising the ability of future generations to live in a greener tomorrow.": 1,
    " We live in a big, diverse, and beautiful world, and that makes me even more passionate to save it.": 1,
    "But it's never enough to steer through your heads about the things that are happening in our world.": 1,
    " It takes you to gear through your hearts.": 1,
    "Because when you gear through your heart, that is when movements are sparked.": 1,
    "That is when opportunities and innovation are created.": 1,
    "And that is when ideas come to life.": 1,
    "Thank you and peace.": 1,
    " and blessings.": 1,
