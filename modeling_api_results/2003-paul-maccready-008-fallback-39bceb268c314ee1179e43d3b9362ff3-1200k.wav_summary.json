    "Let's have the next video.": 2,
    " And that's it.": 2,
    " I am known best for human powered flight, but that was just one thing that got me going in": 1,
    " the sort of things that I'm working in now as a youngster.": 1,
    "I was very interested in model airplanes, ornithopters, autogyros, helicopters, gliders.": 1,
    " power planes, indoor models, outdoor models, everything, which I just thought was a lot of fun.": 1,
    " I wondered why most other people didn't share my same enthusiasm with them.": 1,
    "And then Navy pilot training and after college,": 1,
    " It got into sailplane flying, powerplane flying, and considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun, but got tangled up with some great": 1,
    " professor types who convinced me and everybody else in the field that this was a good way to get into really deep science while this was all going on.": 1,
    " in the field of weather modification, although getting PhD in aeronautics.": 1,
    " The weather modification subject was getting started and as a graduate student I could go around to the various talks that were being given on a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast.": 1,
    " So on and everybody would talk to me, but all the professionals in the field hated each other and they wouldn't communicate.": 1,
    "And as a result, I got absolutely unique background in that.": 1,
    " field and started a company which did more research in weather modification.": 1,
    " anybody, and there are a lot of things that I just can't go into, but then in 1971 started AeroVironment.": 1,
    " with no employees than one and two, three, and sort of fumble along on trying to get interesting projects.": 1,
    "We had aerodynamicists.": 1,
    " who, like I, did not want to work for aerospace companies on some big many-year project.": 1,
    " And so we did our small projects and companies slowly grew.": 1,
    "The thing that was exciting was in 1976.": 1,
    " Suddenly got interested in the human powered airplane because I'd made a loan to a friend of $100,000.": 1,
    "I guaranteed the money at the bank.": 1,
    "He needed them for": 1,
    " He needed the money for starting a company.": 1,
    "The company did not succeed and he couldn't pay the money back and I was the guarantor of the note.": 1,
    " I had a hundred thousand dollar debt and I noticed that the Kramer Prize for human powered flight, which had been around,": 1,
    " for 17 years at the time was 50,000 pounds, which at the exchange rate was just about $100,000.": 1,
    "So suddenly I was interested in human-powered flight.": 1,
    " And did not, the way I approached it first, thinking about ways to make the planes was just like they had been doing in England and not": 1,
    " succeeding, and I gave it up.": 1,
    "I figured, nah, there isn't any simple, easy way.": 1,
    "But then got off on a vacation trip and was studying bird flight just for the": 1,
    " fun of it and even watch a bird soaring around in circles and measure the time and estimate the bank angle.": 1,
    " immediately figure out its speed and the turning radius and so on, which I could do in the car as we were driving along the vacation trip.": 1,
    " with my three sons, young sons, helping me but ridiculing the whole thing very much.": 1,
    " But that, you began thinking about how birds went around and then how airplanes would, how hang gliders would fly and then other planes.": 1,
    " the idea of the Gossamer Condor type airplane quickly emerged.": 1,
    "It was so logical one should have thought of it in the first place, but when": 1,
    " didn't just keep the weight down, 70 pounds was all it weighed, but let the size swell up.": 1,
    " like a hang glider, but three times the span, three times the cord, you're down to a third the speed, a third the power.": 1,
    " a good bicyclist can put out that power and that worked and we won the prize a year later.": 1,
    "We did a lot of flying": 1,
    " A lot of experiments, a lot of things that didn't work, and ones that did work, and the plane kept getting a little better, a little better.": 1,
    "Got a good pilot, Brian Allen, to operate it.": 1,
    " finally succeeded, but unfortunately about $65,000 was spent on the project.": 1,
    " And there's only about 30 to help retire the debt, but fortunately Henry Kramer, who put up the prize for, that was a one-mile flight, put up a new prize for flying the English Channel 21 miles.": 1,
    " And he thought it would take another 18 years for somebody to win that.": 1,
    "We realized that if you just cleaned up our Gossamer Condor a little bit.": 1,
    " The power to fly would be decreased a little bit, and if you decrease the power required a little, the pilot can fly a much longer period of time.": 1,
    " Brian Allen was able, in a miraculous flight, to get the Gossamer Albatross across the English Channel, and we won the \u00a3100,000 prize.": 1,
    " for that and when all expenses were paid, the debt was handled and everything was fine.": 1,
    "It turned out that giving the planes to the museum was worth much more than the": 1,
    " So for five years, six years, I only had to pay one third income tax.": 1,
    "So there were good economic reasons for the project.": 1,
    " The project was done entirely for economic reasons and we have not been involved in any human powered flight since then.": 1,
    " because the prizes are all over.": 1,
    "But that sure started thinking about various things and immediately": 1,
    " we began making a solar powered plane because we felt solar power was going to be so important for the country and the world.": 1,
    "We didn't want the": 1,
    " small funding of the government to be decreased, which is what the government was trying to do with it.": 1,
    "And we thought a solar powered plane wouldn't really make sense, but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help that.": 1,
    " field and that project continued, did succeed, and we then got into other projects in aviation and mechanical.": 1,
    " things and ground devices.": 1,
    "But while this was going on, in 1982 I got a prize from the Lindbergh Foundation, their annual": 1,
    " prize and I had to prepare a paper on it which collected all my varied thoughts and varied interests over the years.": 1,
    "This was one": 1,
    " chance that I had to focus on what I really was after and what was important and to my surprise I realized the importance of environmental issues which Charles Lindbergh devoted the last": 1,
    " third of his life, too.": 1,
    "And preparing that paper did me a lot of good.": 1,
    "I thought back about": 1,
    " If I was a space traveler and came and visited Earth every 5,000 years and for a few thousand visits, I would see the same thing every time, the little differences in the Earth.": 1,
    " But this last time, just coming around right now, suddenly there'd be huge changes in the environment and in the concentration of people and it was just": 1,
    " unbelievable the amount of all the change in it.": 1,
    " I wanted to, well, one of the biggest changes is 200 years ago we began using": 1,
    " coal from underground, which has a lot of pollution.": 1,
    "And 100 years ago, we began getting gasoline from underground with a lot of pollution.": 1,
    " Gasoline consumption or production will reach its limit in about 10 years and then go down and we wonder what's going to happen with transportation.": 1,
    " I wanted to show the slide.": 1,
    "This slide, I think, is the most important one any of you will see.": 1,
    " ever because...": 1,
    " It shows nature versus humans and goes from 1850 to 2050, so the year 2000 you see there.": 1,
    " This is the weight of all air and land vertebrates.": 1,
    "Humans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on are.": 1,
    "The red line goes up.": 1,
    " That's the humans and livestock and pets portion.": 1,
    "The green line goes down.": 1,
    "That's the wild nature portion.": 1,
    "Humans, livestock and pets are now 98% of": 1,
    " of the total world's mass of vertebrates on land and air.": 1,
    "And you don't know what the future will hold, but it's not going to get a": 1,
    " a lower percentage.": 1,
    "Ten thousand years ago, the humans and livestock and pets were not even one tenth of one percent and wouldn't even been visible on such a curve.": 1,
    "Now they are": 1,
    " 98% and it is, I think, shows human domination of the earth.": 1,
    " I give a talk to some remarkable high school students each summer and ask them after they've asked me questions and I give a talk.": 1,
    " Then I asked them questions.": 1,
    "What's the population of the earth?": 1,
    "What's the population of the earth going to be when you're the age of your parents?": 1,
    "Which they had never really thought about, but now they think about it.": 1,
    " what population of the Earth would be an equilibrium that could continue on and be for 2050, 2100, 2150.": 1,
    " And they form little groups all fighting with each other.": 1,
    "And when I leave two hours later, most of them are saying about two billion.": 1,
    " people and they don't have any clue about how to get down to two billion, nor do I, but I think they're right.": 1,
    "And this is a serious": 1,
    " problem.": 1,
    "Rachel Carson was thinking of these and came out with Silent Spring way back.": 1,
    " The solar manifesto by Hermann Scheer in Germany claims all energy on earth can be derived for every country from solar energy and": 1,
    " water, and so on.": 1,
    "You don't need to dig down for these chemicals and we can do things much more efficiently.": 1,
    " Let's have the next slide.": 1,
    "So let's just summarize it.": 1,
    "Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life, complex, improbable, wonderful, and fragile.": 1,
    "Suddenly we humans, a recently arrived species, no longer subject": 1,
    " So the checks and balances inherent in nature have grown in population, technology, and intelligence to a position of terrible power.": 1,
    "We now wield a paintbrush.": 1,
    "We're in charge.": 1,
    " frightening.": 1,
    "And I do a painting every 20 or 25 years.": 1,
    "This is the last one.": 1,
    " and shows the earth in sort of a time flag on the right and trilobites and dinosaurs and so on and over the triangle we now get to civilization and": 1,
    " TV and traffic jams and so on.": 1,
    "I have no idea of what comes next, so I just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the": 1,
    " Future is sort of a little warning and two weeks after this drawing was done.": 1,
    "We actually had our first": 1,
    " project contract at Aeroenvironment on robotic cockroaches, which was very frightening to me.": 1,
    " Well, that'll be all the slides we...": 1,
    " As time went on, we stopped our environmental programs, we focused more on the really serious energy problems of the future, and we produced products.": 1,
    " for the company and we developed the impact car that General Motors made the EV1 out of.": 1,
    " got the Air Resources Board to have the regulations that stimulated the electric cars, but they've since come apart and we've done a lot of": 1,
    " things, small drone airplanes, so on.": 1,
    "I have a Helios.": 1,
    "We have the first video.": 1,
    " with a wingspan of 247 feet.": 1,
    "This makes her larger than a Boeing 747.": 1,
    " Her designer's attention to detail in her construction gives Helios' structure the flexibility and strength to deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere.": 1,
    " This enables her to easily ride through the air currents as if she's sliding along on the ocean waves.": 1,
    "The wings could touch together on top and not break.": 1,
    "We think.": 1,
    " Helios now begins the process of turning her back to the sun to maximize the power from her solar array.": 1,
    " As the sky gets darker and the outside air temperatures drop below minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the most environmentally hostile segment of Helios' journey": 1,
    " has gone by without notice, except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems and their associated sensors.": 1,
    " Approaching a peak radar altitude of 96,863 feet at 412 PM, Helios is standing on top of 98% of the Earth's atmosphere.": 1,
    " This is more than 10,000 feet higher than the previous world's altitude record held by the SR-71 Blackbird.": 1,
    " That plane has many purposes, but it's aimed for communications, and it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at 65,000 feet.": 1,
    " Eventually, we'll be able to have it stay up day, night, day, night for six months at a time acting like the synchronous satellite.": 1,
    " only 10 miles above the earth.": 1,
    "This shows the other end of the spectrum.": 1,
    " It is convenient to carry, assemble, and launch by hand.": 1,
    "Battery powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.": 1,
    " It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.": 1,
    "With onboard GPS, it can navigate autonomously, and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage.": 1,
    "OK.": 1,
    "And let's have the next.": 1,
    " That plane is widely used by the military now in all their operations.": 1,
    " He's got it, he's got it, he's got it on his head.": 1,
    " We're going to end our visit with Paul McCrady's flying circus by meeting his son Tyler, who with his two brothers helped build the Gossamer Condor 25 years ago.": 1,
    "You can chase it like this for hours.": 1,
    " When they got bored with their father's project, they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own.": 1,
    "I can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing or on the other.": 1,
    " They called it their walk-along glider.": 1,
    " I've never seen anything like that.": 1,
    "How old were you when you invented that?": 1,
    "Oh, 10, 11, 12, something like that.": 1,
    "Tyler's here to show you, walk along.": 1,
    " Alright, you all got a couple of these in your gift bags and one of the first things, the production version seemed to dive a little bit and so I would just suggest you bend the wingtips up a little bit before you try flying it.": 1,
    " I'll give you a demonstration of how it works.": 1,
    "The idea is that it soars on the lift over your body like a seagull soaring on a cliff.": 1,
    " As the wind comes up, it has to go over the cliff.": 1,
    "So as you walk through the air, it goes around your body.": 1,
    "Some has to go over you.": 1,
    " And so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current.": 1,
    "The launch is the difficult part.": 1,
    "You've got to hold it high up over your head.": 1,
    "And you start walking forward and just let go of it.": 1,
    " And you can control it like that.": 1,
    " And then also, like it said in the video, you can turn it left or right just by putting the lift under one wing or another.": 1,
    " So I can do a, oh, that was going to be a right turn.": 1,
    " This one will be a left turn.": 1,
    " Anyway.": 1,
    " Um.": 1,
    "So you can just control it wherever you want.": 1,
    "And it's just hours of fun.": 1,
    "And these are no longer in production, so you have real collector's items.": 1,
    " And this, we just wanted to show you a, if we can get the video running on this.": 1,
    "Yeah, just an example.": 1,
    " of video, a little video surveillance.": 1,
    " This was flying around in the party last night.": 1,
    "And you can see how it just can fly around and you can spy on anybody you want.": 1,
    " Ha ha ha": 1,
    "I was going to bring an airplane, but I was worried about hitting people in here, so I thought this would be a little bit more gentle.": 1,
    "And that's it.": 1,
    "Just a few inventions.": 1
