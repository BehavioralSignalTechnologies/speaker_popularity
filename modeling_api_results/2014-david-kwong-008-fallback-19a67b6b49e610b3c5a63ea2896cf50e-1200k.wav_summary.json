    " That one's my favorite.": 2,
    "Pick up just one marker.": 2,
    " puzzles, and magic.": 1,
    " I work in what most people think are two distinct fields, but I believe they are the same.": 1,
    " I am both a magician and a New York Times crossword puzzle constructor.": 1,
    " which basically means I've taken the world's two nerdiest hobbies and combined them into one career.": 1,
    " And I believe that magic and puzzles are the same because they both key into one of the most important human drives, the urge to solve.": 1,
    " Human beings are wired to solve, to make order out of chaos.": 1,
    " It's certainly true for me.": 1,
    "I've been solving my whole life.": 1,
    "High school consisted of epic Scrabble matches in the cafeteria and not really talking to girls.": 1,
    "And then at about that time, I started learning magic tricks and definitely not talking to girls.": 1,
    " There's nothing like starting a conversation with, Hey, did you know that Presta digitation is worth 20 points in Scrabble?": 1,
    " But back then, I noticed an intersection between puzzles and illusion.": 1,
    " When you do the crossword puzzle, or when you watch a magic show, you become a solver.": 1,
    "And your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos.": 1,
    "The chaos of, say, a black and white puzzle grid.": 1,
    " a mixed-up bag of Scrabble tiles, or a shuffled pack of playing cards.": 1,
    "And today, as a Cruciverbalist, 23 points, and an illusion designer, I create that chaos.": 1,
    " I test your ability to solve.": 1,
    "Now, it turns out research tells us that solving is as primal as eating and sleeping.": 1,
    "From birth, we are wired to solve.": 1,
    " In one UCLA study, newborns still in the hospital were shown patterns, patterns like this.": 1,
    "Circle, cross, circle, cross.": 1,
    "And then the pattern was changed.": 1,
    " triangle square.": 1,
    "And by tracking an infant's gaze, we know that newborns, as young as a day old, can notice and respond to disruptions in order.": 1,
    "It's remarkable.": 1,
    " So from infancy through old age, the urge to solve unites us all.": 1,
    "And I even found this photo on Instagram of pop star Katy Perry solving a crossword puzzle with her morning coffee.": 1,
    "Like.": 1,
    " Now solving exists across all cultures.": 1,
    " The American invention is the crossword puzzle.": 1,
    "And this year we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the crossword puzzle, first published in the New York world.": 1,
    " But many other cultures have their signature puzzles as well.": 1,
    "China gives us tangrams, which would test solvers' abilities to form shapes from the jumbled pieces.": 1,
    "Chaos.": 1,
    " an order.": 1,
    "Let's hear it again.": 1,
    " And how about this puzzle invented in 18th century England?": 1,
    "The jigsaw puzzle.": 1,
    "Is this not making order out of chaos?": 1,
    " So as you can see, we are always solving.": 1,
    "We are always trying to decode our world.": 1,
    "It's an eternal quest.": 1,
    "It's just like the one Cervantes wrote about in Don Quixote.": 1,
    " which, by the way, is the root of the word quixitree, the highest-scoring Scrabble word of all time, 365 points.": 1,
    "But anyway, Don Quixote is an important book.": 1,
    "You guys have read Don Quixote, yes?": 1,
    "I'm seeing some heads nod.": 1,
    " Come on, guys, really.": 1,
    "Let's do this.": 1,

    "There we go.": 1,
    "Smart audience.": 1,
    "Get them up.": 1,
    "Good.": 1,
    "Because I need somebody smart here.": 1,
    "Because now I'm going to demonstrate with the help of one of you.": 1,
    " just how deeply rooted your urge to solve is, just how wired to solve all of you really are.": 1,
    "So I'm going to come into the audience and find somebody to help me.": 1,
    "Let's see.": 1,
    " Everybody's looking away all of a sudden.": 1,

    " Did you know that your name is worth eight points in Scrabble?": 1,
    "Okay, stand right here, Gwen, right here.": 1,
    "Now, Gwen, before we begin, I'd like to point out a piece of the puzzle, which is here in this envelope, and I will not go near it.": 1,
    " Okay, and over here we have a drawing of some farm animals.": 1,
    "You can see we have an owl, we have a horse, a donkey, a rooster, an ox, and a sheep.": 1,
    "And then here, Gwen, we have some fancy art store markers, colors like, can you see that word right there?": 1,
    " Cobalt, yes, cobalt.": 1,
    "We have a silver, we have a red, an emerald, and an amber marker.": 1,

    "One marker at a time.": 1,
    "It's going to be a lot of fun.": 1,
    " All right, but I'm going to go over here.": 1,
    "I don't want to see what you're doing.": 1,
    "Okay, so don't start yet.": 1,
    "Wait for me to get over here and close my eyes.": 1,
    "Now, Gwen, are you ready?": 1,
    " And why don't you color in the horse for me.": 1,
    "Color in the horse.": 1,
    "A big, big, big scribbles, broad strokes.": 1,
    "Don't worry about staying in the lines.": 1,
    " All right, great.": 1,
    "And why don't you take that marker and recap it and place it on the table for me?": 1,
    "Okay, and pick up another marker out of the cup.": 1,
    " And take off the cap and color in the donkey for me.": 1,
    "Color in the donkey.": 1,
    "Big scribbles.": 1,
    " Okay, cool.": 1,
    "And recap that marker and place it on the table and pick up another marker for me and take off the cap.": 1,
    "Isn't this fun?": 1,
    "And color, color on the owl for me.": 1,
    "Color on the owl.": 1,
    " Okay, and recap, recap that marker and pick up another marker out of the cup.": 1,
    "And color in the rooster for me, color in the rooster.": 1,
    " Good, good, good, good, good.": 1,
    "Big, big, big strokes.": 1,
    "Good, good.": 1,
    "Pick up another marker out of the cup.": 1,
    " and color in the ox for me, color in the ox.": 1,
    "Okay, good.": 1,
    "And build a lot of color on that and recap and place it on the table and pick up another marker out of the cup.": 1,
    " Oh, I'm out.": 1,
    "I'm going to turn.": 1,
    "I'm going to turn around.": 1,
    "Did I forget them?": 1,
    "Oh, I forgot my purple marker.": 1,
    " This is still going to work, though.": 1,
    "I think this is still going to work, mostly.": 1,
    "All right.": 1,
    "So, Gwen, I'm going to hand you this envelope.": 1,
    "Don't open it yet.": 1,
    "Not open it yet.": 1,
    " but I'm going to write down your choices so that everybody can see the choices that you made.": 1,
    "Okay, great.": 1,
    "So we have a, okay, we have a Cobalt.": 1,
    " Horse.": 1,
    " Amber.": 1,
    " Owl, a silver...": 1,
    " Ox, yes, okay, a red donkey.": 1,
    "And what was the emerald color?": 1,
    " rooster an emerald rooster okay now for the moment of truth Gwen we're gonna take a look in that envelope why don't you open it up and remove": 1,
    " the one piece of paper from inside and hand it to me and we will see if it matches your choices.": 1,
    " Yes, I think it does.": 1,
    "We have a cobalt horse, we have a red donkey, we have an amber owl, we have an emerald rooster, a silver ox.": 1,
    "I forgot my purple marker, so we have a blank sheep.": 1,
    "But that's a pretty amazing coincidence, don't you think?": 1,
    "Gwen, well done.": 1,
    "That's beautiful.": 1,
    " I'll take that back from you.": 1,
    "So, ladies and gentlemen, how is this possible?": 1,
    " How is this possible?": 1,
    "Well, could it be that Gwen's brain is so wired to solve that she decoded hidden messages?": 1,
    " Well, this is the puzzle I present to you.": 1,
    "Could there be order in the chaos that I created?": 1,
    "Let's take a closer look.": 1,
    "Do you recall when I showed you these puzzle pieces?": 1,
    " What image did it ultimately become?": 1,
    "A cobalt horse.": 1,
    "The plot thickens.": 1,
    "And then we played a game of tangrams with an emerald rooster.": 1,
    "And then we had an experiment with a silver ox.": 1,
    " And Katy Perry drinks her morning coffee out of a amber owl.": 1,
    "Thank you, Katy, for taking that photo for me.": 1,
    " Oh, and there's one more, there's one more.": 1,
    "I believe you colored a red donkey, Gwen.": 1,
    "Ladies and gentlemen, could you raise your hands for me if you've read Don Quixote?": 1,
    " But wait, but wait, wait, wait, wait, there's more, there's more.": 1,
    "Gwen, I was so confident that you were going to make these choices that I made another prediction.": 1,
    "And I put it in an even more indelible place.": 1,
    "And it's right here.": 1,
    " Ladies and gentlemen, we have today's New York Times.": 1,
    " The date is March 18th, 2014.": 1,
    "Many of you in the first couple of rows have it underneath your seats as well.": 1,
    "Really dig, we hid them under there.": 1,
    "See if you can fish out the newspaper.": 1,
    " and open up to the arts section and you will find the crossword puzzle.": 1,
    "And the crossword puzzle today was written by yours truly.": 1,
    "You can see my name above the grid.": 1,
    "I'm going to give this to you, Gwen, to take a look.": 1,
    " and I will also put it up on the screen.": 1,
    " Now let's take a look at another piece of the puzzle.": 1,
    " If you look at the first clue for one across, it starts with the letter C for corrupt.": 1,
    "And just below that, we have an O for outfielder.": 1,
    "And if you keep reading the first letters of the clues down, you get cobalt horse.": 1,
    " Amber Owl, Silver Ox, Red Donkey, and Emerald Rooster.": 1,
    " That's pretty cool, right?": 1,
    " the New York Times.": 1,
    "But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.": 1,
    "Oh, Gwen, do you recall how I forgot my purple marker and you were unable to color the sheep?": 1,
    " Well, if you keep reading, starting with 25 down, it says, oh, by the way, the sheep can be left blank.": 1,
    " But wait, wait, wait, there's one more thing.": 1,
    "There's one more thing.": 1,
    "There's one final piece of the puzzle.": 1,
    "Gwen, I am so grateful for your choices because if we take a look at the first letters of your combinations, we get C,": 1,
    " AOS for chaos and ORDER for order.": 1,
    "That's chaos in order.": 1,
    "We've all made order out of chaos.": 1,
    "So ladies and gentlemen, the next time you find yourself with a puzzle, whether it's in your life or in your work,": 1,
    " Or maybe it's at the Sunday morning breakfast table with the New York Times.": 1,
