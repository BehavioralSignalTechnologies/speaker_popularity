    " Nine years ago, I worked for the US government in Iraq, helping rebuild the electricity infrastructure.": 1,
    "And I was there and I worked in that job because I believe that technology can improve people's lives.": 1,
    " One afternoon, I had tea with a storekeeper at the Al Rashid Hotel in Baghdad.": 1,
    "And he said to me, you Americans, you can put a man on the moon.": 1,
    "But when I get home tonight, I won't be able to turn on my lights.": 1,
    " At the time, the US government had spent more than $2 billion on electricity reconstruction.": 1,
    "How do you ensure technology reaches users?": 1,
    "How do you put it in their hands so that it is useful?": 1,
    " So those are the questions that my colleagues and I at DREV ask ourselves.": 1,
    "And DREV is short for Design Revolution.": 1,
    " And I took over the organization four years ago and really focused it on developing products that actually reach users.": 1,
    "And not just any users, but customers who live on less than $4 a day.": 1,
    " One of the key areas we've been working on recently is medical devices.": 1,
    "And while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with Iraq's electricity grid then, there are some commonalities.": 1,
    " Despite the advanced technology, it's not reaching the people who need it most.": 1,
    "So I'm going to tell you about one of the projects we've been working on, the Remotion Knee.": 1,
    "And it's a prosthetic knee for above knee amputees.": 1,
    " And this project started when the Jiper Foot Organization, the largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world, came to the Bay Area and they said, we need a better knee.": 1,
    " Chances are, if you're living on less than $4 a day and you're an amputee, you've lost your limb in a vehicle accident.": 1,
    "Most people think it's landmines, but it's a vehicle accident.": 1,
    " You're walking by the side of the road and you're hit by a truck or you're trying to jump on a moving train.": 1,
    "You're late for work and your pant leg gets caught.": 1,
    " And the reality is that if you don't have much money, like this young man named Kamal right here, the option you really have is a bamboo staff.": 1,
    " to get around.": 1,
    "And how big a problem is this?": 1,
    "There's over 3 million amputees every year who need a new or replacement knee.": 1,
    " And what are their options?": 1,
    "This is a high end.": 1,
    "This is what we would call a smart knee.": 1,
    "It's got a microprocessor inside.": 1,
    "It can pretty much do anything.": 1,
    " But it's $20,000.": 1,
    "And to give you a sense of who wears this, veterans, American veterans coming back from Afghanistan or Iraq would be fit with something like this.": 1,
    " This is a low-end titanium knee.": 1,
    "It's a polycentric knee.": 1,
    "And all that that means is the mechanism.": 1,
    "It's a four-bar mechanism that mimics a natural human knee.": 1,
    "But at $1,400, it's still too expensive for people like Kamal.": 1,
    " And lastly, here you see a low-end knee.": 1,
    "This is a knee that's been designed specifically for poor people.": 1,
    "And while you have affordability, you've lost in functionality.": 1,
    "The mechanism here is a single axis.": 1,
    "And a single axis is like a door hinge.": 1,
    " So you can think about how unstable that would be.": 1,
    "And this is the type of mechanism that the diaper foot organization was using when they were looking for a better knee.": 1,
    "And I just wanted to give you a sense of what a leg system looks like because I'm showing you all these knees and I imagine it's hard to think how it all fits together.": 1,
    " So at the top you have a socket, and this fits over someone's residual limb.": 1,
    "And everyone's residual limb is a little bit different.": 1,
    "And then you have the knee.": 1,
    "And here I've got a single axis on the knee, so you can see how it rotates.": 1,
    "And then a pylon, and then a foot.": 1,
    " And we've been able to develop a knee, a polycentric knee, so that type of knee that acts like a human knee, mimics human gait, for $80 retail.": 1,
    " But the key is, you can have this great invention, you can have this great design, but how do you get it to the people who most need it?": 1,
    "How do you ensure it gets to them and it improves their lives?": 1,
    " So at DREV, we've done some other projects and we looked at three things that we really believe ensures gets technologies to customers, to users, to people who need it.": 1,
    " And the first thing is that the product needs to be world class.": 1,
    "It needs to perform on par or better than the best products on the market.": 1,
    "Regardless of your income level, you want the most beautiful, the best product that there is.": 1,
    " I'm gonna show you a video now.": 1,
    " of a man named Ash, you can see him walking.": 1,
    "He's wearing the same knee system here with a single axis knee.": 1,
    "And he's doing a 10 meter walk test.": 1,
    "And you'll notice that he's struggling with stability as he's walking.": 1,
    " And something that's not obvious that you can't see is that it's psychologically draining to walk and to be preventing yourself from falling.": 1,
    " Now, this is a video of Kamal.": 1,
    "You remember Kamal earlier holding the bamboo staff.": 1,
    "He's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee.": 1,
    "And he's doing that same 10 meter walk test.": 1,
    "And you can see his stability is much better.": 1,
    " So world class isn't just about technical performance, it's also about human performance.": 1,
    "And most medical devices we've learned as we've dug in are really designed for Westerners, for welfare economies.": 1,
    "But the reality is, is our users, our customers,": 1,
    " They do different things.": 1,
    "They sit cross-legged more.": 1,
    "We see that they squat.": 1,
    "They kneel in prayer.": 1,
    "And we designed our knee to have the greatest range of motion of almost any other knee on the market.": 1,
    " So the second thing we learned, and this leads into my second point, which is that we believe that products need to be designed to be user-centric.": 1,
    "And at D-ROVE, we go one step further and we say, you need to be user-obsessed.": 1,
    " So it's not just the end user that you're thinking about, but everyone who interacts with the product.": 1,
    "So for example, the processes who fits the knee, but also the context in which the knee is being fit.": 1,
    " What is the local market like?": 1,
    "How do all these components get to the clinic?": 1,
    "Do they all get there on time?": 1,
    "The supply chain, everything that goes into ensuring that this product gets to the end user and it goes into part of the system and is used.": 1,
    " So I wanted to show you some of the iterations we did between the first version, the Jipernee.": 1,
    "So this is it right here.": 1,
    " Notice anything about it?": 1,
    "It clicks.": 1,
    "We had seen that users had actually modified it.": 1,
    "So do you see that black strip right there?": 1,
    "That's a homemade noise dampener.": 1,
    " We also saw that our users had modified it in other ways.": 1,
    "You can see there that that particular amputee, he had wrapped bandages around the knee.": 1,
    "He'd made a cosmesis.": 1,
    "And if you look at the knee,": 1,
    " It's got those pointy edges, right?": 1,
    "So if you're wearing it under pants or a skirt or a sari, it's really obvious that you're wearing a prosthetic limb.": 1,
    "And in societies where there's social stigma around being disabled,": 1,
    " People are particularly cute about this.": 1,
    "So I'm going to show you some of the modifications we did.": 1,
    "We did a lot of iterations, not just around this, but some other things.": 1,
    "But here we have the version 3, the Remotion-y.": 1,
    "But if you look in here, you can see a noise dampener.": 1,
    " It's quieter.": 1,
    "The other thing we did is that we smoothed the profile.": 1,
    "We made it thinner.": 1,
    "And something that's not obvious is that we designed it for mass production.": 1,
    " And this goes into my last point.": 1,
    "We really truly believe that if a product is going to reach users at the scale that it's needed, it needs to be market driven.": 1,
    "And market driven means": 1,
    " that the products are sold.": 1,
    "They're not donated.": 1,
    "They're not heavily subsidized.": 1,
    "Our product needs to be designed to offer value to the end user.": 1,
    "It also has to be designed to be very affordable.": 1,
    " But a product that is valued by a customer is used by a customer.": 1,
    "And use is what creates impact.": 1,
    "And we believe that as designers, it holds us accountable to our customers.": 1,
    "And with centralized manufacturing,": 1,
    " you can control the quality control and you can hit that $80 price point with profit margins built in.": 1,
    "And those profit margins are critical because if you want to scale, if you want to reach all the people in the world who possibly need a knee, it needs to be economically sustainable.": 1,
    " So I want to give you a sense of where we at.": 1,
    "We have fit over 5,000 amputees.": 1,
    "And one of the big indicators we're looking at, of course, is does it improve lives?": 1,
    "Well, the standard is, is someone still wearing their knee six months later?": 1,
    " The industry averages about 65%.": 1,
    "Ours is 79%.": 1,
    "And we're hoping to get that higher.": 1,
    " Right now, our knees are worn in 12 countries.": 1,
    "This is where we want to get though in the next three years.": 1,
    "We'll double the impact in 2015 and we'll double it each of the following years after that.": 1,
    "But then we hit a new challenge.": 1,
    " And that's the number of skilled prostheses who are able to fit knees.": 1,
    " So I want to end with a story of Pranima.": 1,
    "Pranima was 18 years old when she was in a car accident where she lost her leg.": 1,
    "And she traveled 12 hours by train to come to the clinic to be fit with a knee.": 1,
    " And while all of the amputees who wear our knees affect us as the designers, she's particularly meaningful to me as an engineer and as a woman because she was in school, she had just started school to study engineering.": 1,
    " And she said, well, now that I can walk again, I can go back and complete my studies.": 1,
    "And to me, she represents the next generation of engineers solving problems and ensuring meaningful technologies reach their users.": 1,
    " So thank you.": 1
