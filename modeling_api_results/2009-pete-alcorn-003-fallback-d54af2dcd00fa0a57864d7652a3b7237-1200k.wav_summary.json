    " I used to be a Malthusian.": 1,
    "This was my mental model of the world.": 1,
    " Exploding population, small planet, it's going to lead to ugly things.": 1,
    "But I'm moving past Malthus because I think that we just might be about 150 years from a kind of new enlightenment.": 1,
    "Here's why.": 1,
    " This is the UN's population data you may have seen for the world, and the world's population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion late this century.": 1,
    "And after that, most likely, it's going to begin to decline.": 1,
    " So what then?": 1,
    " Most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth.": 1,
    "So a lot of economists look at declining population and expect to see stagnation, maybe depression.": 1,
    " But a declining population is going to have at least two very beneficial economic effects.": 1,
    "One, fewer people on a fixed amount of land.": 1,
    " make investing in property a bad bet.": 1,
    " In the cities, a lot of the cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value.": 1,
    "Take away land speculation.": 1,
    " price of land drops, and that begins to lift a heavy burden off the world's poor.": 1,
    " Number two, a declining population means scarce labor.": 1,
    "Scarce labor drives wages.": 1,
    "As wages increase, that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class.": 1,
    " Now I'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the Black Death, but look what happened in Europe after the plague.": 1,
    " Rising wages, land reform.": 1,
    " technological innovation, birth of the middle class, and after that, forward-looking social movements like the Renaissance and later the Enlightenment.": 1,
    " Most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward, romanticizing the past.": 1,
    " All of the Western religions begin with the notion of Eden and descend through a kind of profligate present to a very ugly future.": 1,
    " So human history is viewed as sort of this downhill slide from the good old days.": 1,
    "But I think we're in for another change about two generations after the top of that curve.": 1,
    " once the effects of a declining population start to settle in.": 1,
    "At that point, we'll start romanticizing the future again instead of the nasty, brutish past.": 1,
    " So why does this matter?": 1,
    "Why talk about social and economic movements that may be more than a century away?": 1,
    "Because transitions are dangerous times.": 1,
    " When landowners start to lose money and labor demands more pay, there's some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future.": 1,
    " Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions.": 1,
    "If we have a positive view about the future, then we may be able to accelerate through that turn instead of careening off a cliff.": 1,
    " If we can make it through the next 150 years, I think that your great-great grandchildren will forget all about Malthus, and instead, they'll be planning for the future and starting to build the 22nd century enlightenment.": 1,
    "Thank you.": 1
