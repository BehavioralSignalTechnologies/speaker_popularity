    "Yeah.": 2,
    "In these?": 2,
    " I don't think so.": 2,
    " Amy and I thought we'd just talk a little bit and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete.": 1,
    " Well, for those of you who hadn't seen the picture in the bio, might have given it away.": 1,
    "I'm a double amputee.": 1,
    "I was born without fibulas in both legs.": 1,
    "I was amputated at age one and I've been": 1,
    " running like hell ever since, all over the place.": 1,
    "Why don't you tell them how you got to Georgetown?": 1,
    "Why don't we just start there?": 1,
    "I'm a senior at Georgetown in the Foreign Service program.": 1,
    " I won a full academic scholarship out of high school.": 1,
    "They picked three students out of the nation every year to get involved with international affairs.": 1,
    "And so I won a full ride to Georgetown.": 1,
    " I've been there for four years.": 1,
    "Love it.": 1,
    "When Amy got there, she decided that she's kind of curious about track and field.": 1,
    "So she decided to call someone and start asking about it.": 1,
    "So why don't you tell that story?": 1,
    " Yeah, well, I've always been involved in sports.": 1,
    "I played sockball for five years growing up.": 1,
    "I skied competitively throughout high school.": 1,
    "And I got a little restless in college because I wasn't doing anything for about a year or two sports-wise.": 1,
    " And I'd never competed on a disabled level.": 1,
    "I'd always competed against other able-bodied athletes.": 1,
    "That's all I'd ever known.": 1,
    "In fact, I'd never even met another amputee until I was 17.": 1,
    " And I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners.": 1,
    "And I figured, I don't know about this.": 1,
    " But before I judge it, let me go see what it's all about.": 1,
    "So I booked myself a flight to Boston in 95.": 1,
    " 19 years old and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race.": 1,
    "I'd never done it before.": 1,
    "I went out on a gravel track a couple weeks before this meet to see how far I could run and about 50 meters was enough for me.": 1,
    " panting and heaving.": 1,
    "And I had these legs that were made of like a wood and plastic compound attached with Velcro straps, big, thick, five-ply wool socks on.": 1,
    "Not the most comfortable things, but all I'd ever known.": 1,
    " And I'm up there in Boston against people wearing legs made of, of all things, carbon graphite and, you know, shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things that they're all looking at me like.": 1,
    " OK, we know who's not going to win this race.": 1,
    "And I went up there expecting, I don't know what I was expecting, but when I saw": 1,
    " A man who was missing an entire leg go up to the high jump, hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six feet two inches.": 1,
    "Dan O'Brien jumped 5'11 in 96 in Atlanta.": 1,
    " I mean, if it just gives you a comparison of these are truly accomplished athletes without qualifying that word athlete.": 1,
    "And so I decided to give this a shot.": 1,
    " you know, heart pounding.": 1,
    "I ran my first race and I beat the national record holder by three hundredths of a second.": 1,
    " and became the new national record holder on my first try out.": 1,
    "And I'd say, you know, people said, you know, Amy, you've got speed.": 1,
    "You've got natural speed, but you've": 1,
    " don't have any skill or finesse going down that track.": 1,
    "You were all over the place.": 1,
    "We all saw how hard you were working.": 1,
    "And so I decided to call the track coach of Georgetown.": 1,
    "And thank God I didn't know just how": 1,
    " huge this man is in the track and field world.": 1,
    "He's coached five Olympians, and the man's office is lined from floor to ceiling with All-America certificates of all these athletes he's coached.": 1,
    " I'm just a rather intimidating figure.": 1,
    "And I called him up and said, listen, I ran one race and I've won.": 1,
    "And I want to.": 1,
    " I want to see if I can, you know, I need to just see if I can sit in on some of your practices, see what drills you do, whatever.": 1,
    "That's all I wanted, just two practices.": 1,
    "Can I just sit in and see what you do?": 1,
    " Well, we should meet first before we decide anything.": 1,
    "He's thinking, what am I getting myself into?": 1,
    "So I met the man, walked into his office and saw all these posters and magazine covers of People Heaps Coach.": 1,
    " And we said, we got to talking.": 1,
    "And it turned out to be a great partnership, because he'd never coach a disabled athlete.": 1,
    "So therefore, he had no preconceived notions of what I was or wasn't capable of.": 1,
    "And I'd never been coached before.": 1,
    " Here we go.": 1,
    "Let's start on this trip.": 1,
    "So he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break, his free time, that I would come up to the track and train with him.": 1,
    " So that's how I met Frank.": 1,
    "But that was fall of 95.": 1,
    "And then by the winter rolling around, he said, you're good enough.": 1,
    "You can run on our women's track team here.": 1,
    " And I said, no, come on.": 1,
    "And he said, no, no, really.": 1,
    "You can't.": 1,
    "You can run with our women's track team.": 1,
    "So spring of 1996, with my goal of making the US Paralympic team that May,": 1,
    " And coming up full speed, I joined the women's track team.": 1,
    "And no disabled person had ever done that, run at a collegiate level.": 1,
    " I don't know, it's starting to become an interesting mix.": 1,
    "Well, why don't you tell them, like, on your way to the Olympics, but a couple of memorable events happened at Georgetown.": 1,
    "Why don't you just tell them?": 1,
    " Well, you know, I'd want everything as far as disabled needs.": 1,
    "Anything I competed in and, you know, training at Georgetown.": 1,
    " knowing that I was going to have to get real used to seeing the backs of all these women's shirts running against the next Flojo.": 1,
    "And they're all looking at me like, hmm, what is?": 1,
    " You know, what's going on here?": 1,
    "And putting on my Georgetown uniform and going out there and knowing that in order to become better, and I'm already the best in the country, you have to train people who are inherently better than you.": 1,
    " And I went out there and made it to the Big East, which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season.": 1,
    " And really, really hot.": 1,
    "And it's the first.": 1,
    "I had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio.": 1,
    " I didn't realize at that time that the amount of sweating that I would be doing in the socket actually acted like a lubricant and I'd be kind of pissing in the socket.": 1,
    "And at about 85 meters of my 100-meter sprint in all my glory,": 1,
    " I came out of my leg, like almost came out of it in front of like 5,000 people.": 1,
    "And I mean, just mortified, because I was signed up for the 200, which went off in a half hour.": 1,
    " I went to my coach and said, please don't make me do this.": 1,
    "I can't do this anymore.": 1,
    "All these people, my legs would come off.": 1,
    "And if it came off at 85, there's no way I'm going 200 meters.": 1,
    " And he just sat there like this.": 1,
    "And my pleas fell on deaf ears, thank God.": 1,
    "Because he was like, the man's from Brooklyn.": 1,
    "He's a big man.": 1,
    "And he says, hey, mate.": 1,
    " So what if your leg falls off?": 1,
    "You pick it up, you put the damn thing back on and finish the goddamn...": 1,
    " And I did.": 1,
    " So it sort of, he kept me in line.": 1,
    "He kept me on the right track.": 1,
    " Amy makes it to the 1996 Paralympics, and she's all excited.": 1,
    "Her family's coming down.": 1,
    "It's a big deal.": 1,
    "She's now two years you've been running?": 1,
    "No, a year.": 1,
    " And why don't you tell them what happened right before you go run your race?": 1,
    " a little bit of clarification, are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities, amputees, persons with cerebral palsy, and wheelchair athletes, as opposed to the Special Olympics, which deals with people with mental disabilities.": 1,
    " So here we are like a week after the Olympics and down Atlanta and I'm just blown away by the fact that just a year ago I got out on a gravel track and couldn't run 50 meters.": 1,
    " And so here I am, never lost.": 1,
    "I set new records at the U.S.": 1,
    "Nationals, the Olympic trials that May, and was just...": 1,
    " You know, sure of it that I was coming home with the gold.": 1,
    "I was also the only what they call bilateral BK below the knee.": 1,
    "I was the only woman to be doing the long jump.": 1,
    " I started the long jump and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and said, how do you do that?": 1,
    "You know, we're supposed to have a planter foot so we can't get off on the springboard.": 1,
    " Well, I just did it.": 1,
    "No one told me that.": 1,
    "So it's funny.": 1,
    "I'm three inches within the world record.": 1,
    "And it kept on from that point.": 1,
    "So I signed up in the long jump.": 1,
    "Signed up.": 1,
    "So I made it to the long jump and the 100 meter.": 1,
    " And I'm sure of it.": 1,
    "I made the front page of my hometown paper that I delivered for six years.": 1,
    "This is my time for shine.": 1,
    " And we're at the warm-up stadium, Cheney warm-up track, which is a few blocks away from the Olympic Stadium.": 1,
    "And these legs that I was on, which I'll take out right now.": 1,
    "I was the first person in the world on these legs.": 1,
    "I was the guinea pig.": 1,
    " I'm telling this was like talk about a tourist attraction.": 1,
    "Everyone was taking pictures of what is this girl running on?": 1,
    "And I'm looking around like where's my competition?": 1,
    "It's my first international meet.": 1,
    " I tried to get out of anybody I could.": 1,
    "Who am I running against here?": 1,
    "Amy, we'll have to get back to you on that one.": 1,
    "I wanted to find out times.": 1,
    "Don't worry.": 1,
    "You're doing great.": 1,
    " This is 20 minutes before my race in Olympic Stadium.": 1,
    "And they post the heat sheets.": 1,
    "And I go over and I look.": 1,
    "And my fastest time, which was world record, was 15.77.": 1,
    " Then I'm looking, the next lane two is 12.8, lane three is 12.5, lane four is 12.2.": 1,
    "What's going on?": 1,
    "And they shove us all under the shuttle bus, and all the women there are missing a hand.": 1,
    " No.": 1,
    " I'm just like...": 1,
    " And they're all looking at me like, which one of these is not like the other?": 1,
    "I'm sitting there like, oh my god.": 1,
    " Oh my God, you know, I'd never lost anything, like whether it be this scholarship or, you know, I'd won five golds when I skied and everything, you know, I came in first.": 1,
    "And Georgetown, you know, that was great.": 1,
    " I was losing, but it was the best training, because this was Atlanta.": 1,
    "But here we are, like, creme de la creme, and there is no doubt about it that I'm going to lose, big.": 1,
    " I just think, oh my God, my whole family got in a van and drove down here from Pennsylvania.": 1,
    "I was the only female U.S.": 1,
    "sprinter.": 1,
    " So, you know, they call us out and, you know, ladies, you have one minute.": 1,
    " And I remember just putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified because there was this murmur coming over the crowd, like the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see.": 1,
    "And I'm like, I know.": 1,
    "Look.": 1,
    "You know?": 1,
    " This isn't right.": 1,
    "That's my last card to play here.": 1,
    "At least if I'm not going to beat these girls, I'm going to mess their heads a little bit.": 1,
    " I mean, it was definitely the Rocky IV sensation of me versus Germany and, you know, everyone else, Estonia and Poland was in this.": 1,
    " And, you know, the gun went off and all I remember was, you know, finishing last and, you know, fighting back tears of frustration.": 1,
    " incredible, incredible, this feeling of being overwhelmed.": 1,
    "And I had to think about why did I do this?": 1,
    "I had won everything.": 1,
    "And it was like, what was the point of this training?": 1,
    "And I transformed my life.": 1,
    " I became a collegiate athlete, you know, became an Olympic athlete.": 1,
    "And it made me really think about how, you know, the achievement was getting there.": 1,
    "I mean the fact that I set my sight just a year and three months before that on": 1,
    " becoming an Olympic athlete and saying, you know, here's my life going in this direction and I want to take it here for a while.": 1,
    "And just seeing how far I could push it and the fact that I asked for help, how many people jumped on board.": 1,
    " how many people gave it their time and their expertise and their patience to deal with me.": 1,
    "And that was like this collective glory that there was 50 people behind me that": 1,
    " had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta.": 1,
    "So I mean it's, I apply this sort of philosophy now to everything I do about like this, this.": 1,
    " you know, sitting back and realizing the progression, like, how far you've come at this day to this goal, you know.": 1,
    "It's important to focus on a goal, I think, but": 1,
    " You know, also recognize the progression on the way there and how you've grown as a person.": 1,
    "That's the achievement, I think.": 1,
    "That's the real achievement.": 1,
    "Why don't you show them your legs?": 1,
    "Oh, sure.": 1,
    " She has more than one set of legs.": 1,
    "These are my pretty legs.": 1,
    "These are my cosmetic legs, actually.": 1,
    " And they're absolutely beautiful.": 1,
    "You have to come up and see them.": 1,
    "They have hair follicles on them, and I can paint my toenails.": 1,
    " Seriously, I can wear heels.": 1,
    "You know, you guys don't understand what that's like to be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want.": 1,
    "You got to pick your height.": 1,
    "I got to pick my height, exactly.": 1,
    " Patrick Ewing, who played for Georgetown in the 80s, comes back every summer.": 1,
    "And I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he'd come in with foot injuries.": 1,
    " Get it off.": 1,
    "Don't worry about it.": 1,
    "You can be eight feet tall.": 1,
    "Just take them off.": 1,
    " He didn't find it so humorous, but as I did anyway.": 1,
    "Okay, now these are my sprinting likes.": 1,
    "Metacarbon graphite, like I said.": 1,
    " Make sure I got that right.": 1,
    " Oh, I've got so many bags in here.": 1,
    " You want to hold that, actually?": 1,
    "That's another leg I have for tennis and softball.": 1,
    "It has a shock absorber in it, so it makes this neat sound when you jump and run around it.": 1,
    " All right.": 1,
    "And then this is the silicone thing that I roll over.": 1,
    "Silicone sheath I roll over to keep it on, which when I sweat, I'm pissing out of it.": 1,
    "Are you a different height?": 1,
    "I don't know.": 1,
    "I might be a little taller.": 1,
    "I should put both of them on.": 1,
    "She can't really stand on these legs.": 1,
    "She has to be moving, so... Yeah, I definitely have to be moving, and these balances sort of...": 1,
    " a little bit of an art in them.": 1,
    " Without having the silicone stock, I'm just going to try to slip in it.": 1,
    " So I run on these and have shocked half the world on these.": 1,
    " These are supposed to simulate.": 1,
    " the actual form of a sprinter when they run.": 1,
    "If you ever watch a sprinter, the ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track.": 1,
    "So when I stand on these legs, my hamstring and my glutes are contracted as I would be had I had feet and were standing on the ball of my": 1,
    " of my feet.": 1,
    "So it's a company in San Diego called Flexfoot, and I was a guinea pig, and as I hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out.": 1,
    " But actually, these, like I said, are still the actual prototype.": 1,
    "I need to get some new ones, because the last meet I was at, they're, you know, it's like a big, it's.": 1,
    " Come full circle.": 1,
    "Amy and the designer of them will be at TedMed, too.": 1,
    "And we'll talk about the design of them.": 1,
    "We'll do that.": 1,
    "Yeah, there you go.": 1,
    " So these are the sprint lengths, and I put my other feet that I cut.": 1,
    "And tell them who designed your other legs.": 1,
    "Yeah, and these I got in a place called Bournemouth, England, about two hours south of London.": 1,
    " And I'm the only person in the United States with these, which is a crime, because they are so beautiful.": 1,
    "And I don't even mean because of the toes and everything.": 1,
    " You know, for me, while I'm such a serious athlete on the track, I want to be feminine off the track.": 1,
    "And I think it's so important, you know, not to be limited in any capacity, whether it's": 1,
    " you know, your mobility or even fashion.": 1,
    "I mean, I love the fact that I can go in anywhere and pick out what I want, the shoes I want, the skirts I want.": 1,
    " So I'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people.": 1,
    "They're also silicone.": 1,
    "This is like a really basic, basic prosthetic limb under here.": 1,
    "It's like a Barbie foot.": 1,
    " under this.": 1,
    "It is.": 1,
    "I mean, it's just stuck in this position, so I have to wear a two-inch heel.": 1,
    "And, I mean, it's really": 1,
    " Let me take this off so you can, I don't know how good you can see it, but like it really is, there's veins on the feet, and my heel's like pink, you know, and my Achilles tendon, it moves a little bit.": 1,
    " And it's really an amazing piece of work.": 1,
    "I got them a year and two weeks ago.": 1,
    " And this is just a silicone piece of skin.": 1,
    "I mean, what happened was two years ago, this man in Belgium was saying, you know, God, if I can go into Madame Tussaud's wax museum and see": 1,
    " Jerry Hall replicated down to the color of her eyes, looking so real as if she would breathe.": 1,
    "Why can't they build a limb for someone that looks like a leg?": 1,
    " you know, or an arm or a hand.": 1,
    "I mean, they make ears for burn victims.": 1,
    "They do amazing stuff with silicone.": 1,
    "Two weeks ago, Amy was up for the Arthur Ashe Award at the ESPYs.": 1,
    " And she came into town and she rushed around and she said, I have to buy some new shoes.": 1,
    "We're an hour before the ESPYs, and she thought she'd gotten a two-inch heel, but she'd actually bought a three-inch heel.": 1,
    " And this pose is a problem for me because it means I'm walking like that all night long.": 1,
    "I can't walk.": 1,
    "45 minutes.": 1,
    "We had the, luckily the hotel was terrific.": 1,
    "They got someone to come and saw off the shoes.": 1,
    " I said the receptionist, I mean, I am just harried and Cheryl's at my side, I said, look, give anybody here who can help me with this, I have this problem, because at first they're just going to write me off, like, look, if you don't like your shoes, sorry, it's too late.": 1,
    "No, no, no, no, no, no.": 1,
    " I've got these special feet, okay, that need a two-inch heel.": 1,
    "I have a three-inch heel.": 1,
    "I need a little bit off.": 1,
    " OK, you know, they didn't even want to go there.": 1,
    "They didn't even want to touch that one.": 1,
    "They just did it.": 1,
    "No, these legs are great.": 1,
    "I'm doing them.": 1,
    " I'm actually going back in a couple weeks to get some improvements.": 1,
    "I want to get legs like these made for flat feet so I can wear sneakers, because I can't with these ones.": 1,
    " So that's it.": 1,
    "That's Amy Mullins.": 1
